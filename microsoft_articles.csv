2,2019-02-04T08:13:39-0500,"Satya Nadella became Microsoft's CEO on Feb. 4, 2014.Since then the company's stock has risen almost 182 percent.Nadella's compensation is lower than the CEOs of some companies with lesser stock growth.Microsoft is one of Wall Street's most obvious turnaround stories in recent history.The company has added almost $500 billion to its market cap since Satya Nadella took the CEO position five years ago today. Internally and externally, the company is viewed more favorably than it was under Nadella's predecessors.But Nadella has not yet joined the ranks of the world's most valuable individuals. Meanwhile, Microsoft co-founder and original CEO Bill Gates is the second-richest person on the planet, with a net worth of $95.7 billion, and the company's second CEO, Steve Ballmer, is worth approximately $39.2 billion, according to data from Bloomberg.However, executives typically don't reach billionaire status with a resume like Nadella's. Typically, they'd have to found the company, like billionaires Marc Benioff of Salesforce or Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. Or they'd have to be CEO of the company for several years, like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who has been CEO of that company since 2005. Dimon became a billionaire in 2015, according to Bloomberg.In the most recent fiscal year, which ended on June 30, Nadella received $25.8 million in total compensation, according to Microsoft's most recent proxy statement. That's up 29 percent year over year. His pay was higher than many other CEOs of companies in the S&amp;P 500. But it's lower than the chiefs of companies with lower stock growth over the past five years, like Oracle's Mark Hurd ($108.3 million), Walt Disney's Bob Iger ($65.6 million) and 21st Century Fox's Rupert Murdoch ($50.3 million).Taking into account a recent stock sale and his Microsoft holdings, Nadella is likely worth more than $320 million. But not much more.""Whatever they're paying him, it's not enough,"" former Microsoft executive Brad Silverberg told CNBC.Nadella once worked for Silverberg, who left the company in 1999 and is a founding partner at venture capital firm Ignition Partners. He provided input for the selection of Ballmer's replacement. Silverberg took into consideration the qualities he remembered about Nadella — that he was humble, and that he recommended strategies that were in the best interest of the company, not himself. He thought Nadella, then a 22-year company veteran, would make a great CEO, and today he feels Nadella exceeded his expectations.""I'm really happy with his contributions to the company,"" Silverberg said. ""Obviously the stock price is one metric, but if you look at the internal culture of the company, people are happy there. People are really proud to work for Microsoft. I think he's done a lot to make that happen.""Investors are happy with Nadella as well: Microsoft's stock has risen nearly 182 percent since Nadella took over, according to FactSet.""If you look at the stock's more than doubling in value, clearly one could argue he's underpaid relative to the wealth creation he's been able to do in the stock,"" said Brent Bracelin, managing director at KeyBanc Capital Markets.""They have been able to transform one of the legacy client-server models, and they're now becoming the leader in cloud across IaaS [infrastructure as a service] and SaaS [software as a service], and he's done it, yet, look at his comp.""Microsoft's perception has improved in Silicon Valley, too.When Nadella took the helm, Steve Herrod, a former VMware executive and now managing director at venture capital firm General Catalyst Partners, didn't have any Microsoft apps on his phone. Now Herrod has nine Microsoft apps on his phone, and he believes Microsoft has the best mobile email app: Outlook.One start-up Herrod invested in, Impira, chose Microsoft's Azure cloud because the team thought Microsoft's cloud-based artificial intelligence capability was better than what was available from the Amazon and Google clouds, Herrod said.""From all perspectives, he's done an outstanding job, and a top-five CEO should have a commensurate package,"" Herrod said of Nadella.The company is more open and flexible now, and assets like LinkedIn and GitHub have given Microsoft meaningful data, said Gordon Ritter, founder and general partner of venture firm Emergence Capital.""If I were on the board of Microsoft, I would say, 'Did he really look at things differently than those that came before and actually interrupt the natural processes that were going on?' And my answer is yes, compared to the interruptions Tim Cook did do or didn't do. I would say he interrupted and changed the course of Microsoft in fundamental way.""Given that, Ritter said Nadella would be deserving of some kind of additional grant.""I think everybody feels good about Satya as CEO of the company -- Bill and Steve and the company's board of directors,"" Silverberg said. ""They should thank their lucky stars that that's who they hired as CEO.""Microsoft didn't respond to a request for comment.WATCH: Microsoft CEO: We're in the midst of a massive transformation"

On Wednesday the company's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, told analysts on a conference call that the company is picking up more major commitments around using Microsoft Azure, like the five-year deal with Gap Inc. that was announced in November.The trend points to Microsoft becoming a more mature operator in the cloud business as it seeks to catch up with market leader Amazon Web Services. Last year, Amazon talked for the first time about revenue that had not yet been recognized through contracts that are more than one year long, primarily from AWS. At the end of the third quarter Amazon had $17.8 billion in revenue that hadn't been recognized.Hood first talked about Microsoft picking up ""larger and longer-term agreements"" on an earnings call last July. She didn't bring up the subject again on the earnings call in October. Then, on Wednesday, she provided an update.""Commercial bookings were strong, growing 18 percent and 22 percent in constant currency, driven by solid renewal execution and an increase in the number of larger longer-term Azure contracts,"" Hood said.Microsoft's commercial bookings growth for the fiscal second quarter exceeded the 7 percent growth one year earlier, and the 15 percent growth from the fiscal first quarter.Hood's remarks came a day before Amazon is scheduled to talk about its latest AWS results.Microsoft's Azure revenue for the four most recent quarters could be more than $9.5 billion, based on an estimate from Brent Bracelin, managing director of KeyBanc Capital Markets.

It said on Wednesday that Bing had been blocked in China and that it was trying to determine its next steps.Searches performed on Bing's China website at cn.bing.com from within mainland China on Wednesday directed users to a page saying the server could not be reached.The government's Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) watchdog did not respond to faxed questions about Bing's blocked website.Bing was the only major foreign search engine accessible from within China's so-called Great Firewall, with Microsoft censoring search results on sensitive topics, in accordance with Chinese government policy.Its main competitor in mainland China is Baidu, which this week pledged to improve its media aggregating service after a complaint about the quality of the service and its search results went viral on social media.Should Bing be blocked, it would mark Microsoft's second setback in China since November 2017, when its Skype internet phone call and messaging service was pulled from Apple and Android app stores.Microsoft also has a partnership with Chinese data center provider 21Vianet to sell its Azure and Office 365 products.Alphabet's Google search platform has been blocked in China since 2010. Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in December that it has no plans to relaunch a search engine in China, though it is continuing to study the idea amid increased scrutiny of big technology firms.China's President Xi Jinping has accelerated control of the internet in China since 2016 as the ruling Communist Party has sought to crack down on dissent on social media.In a statement on Wednesday, the CAC said it had deleted more than 7 million pieces of online information and 9,382 mobile apps.The watchdog also criticized technology company Tencent's news app for spreading ""vulgar information"".

9,2019-01-30T15:30:02-0500,"Microsoft's revenue was slightly below consensus as revenue from Windows device makers fell.Azure's revenue growth was flat sequentially at 76 percent.Shares of Microsoft stock fell as much as 4 percent Wednesday after the company issued its fiscal second-quarter earnings report with slightly lower revenue than expected.Here are the major numbers:Earnings: $1.10 per share, excluding certain items, vs. $1.09 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.Revenue: $32.47 billion, vs. $32.51 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.Revenue increased 12 percent year over year in the quarter, which ended on Dec. 31, Microsoft said in a statement.While Microsoft again declined to disclose exact revenue for the Azure cloud business that's contributed to the company's success in recent years, Microsoft did say Azure grew 76 percent, which is flat sequentially from the previous quarter.Given comments from Intel, Juniper and other companies related to spending on infrastructure, Microsoft investors had reason to be concerned about what that means for Azure, said Brent Bracelin, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets who has a ""buy"" rating on the stock. Bracelin had predicted around 74 percent growth, or $2.85 billion in revenue.Microsoft said it collected $9 billion in revenue from its Commercial Cloud category, which includes the Azure public cloud, commercial subscriptions to the Office 365 productivity software bundle, the Enterprise Mobility and Security products and commercial LinkedIn services.The unit was up 48 percent, reflecting a sequentially higher growth rate from 47 percent one quarter ago. Bracelin had estimated it would rise 44.8 percent this time around. The gross margin for Commercial Cloud held steady sequentially at 62 percent.Azure is second to Amazon Web Services in the market for cloud infrastructure, which lets companies offload their computing and data storage. Bracelin predicted Azure would contribute $2.85 billion in the quarter, implying around 74 percent growth, down sequentially from the prior quarter. Amazon, which publishes results tomorrow, is expected to report AWS revenue of $7.3 billion, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.""Within the next five years I don't envision Azure catching up,"" Bracelin said in an interview this week. He said that within 10 years, Azure could be bigger if AWS is still part of Amazon.""The debate becomes at some point, do Amazon.com's ambitions limit the opportunities for AWS because of the competitive aspirations they have, that just limits the ability for AWS to grow,"" Bracelin said.Microsoft's top business segment, More Personal Computing -- which encompasses gaming, search advertising, Surface and Windows -- hit $12.99 billion in revenue, below the $13.08 billion consensus estimate among analysts polled by FactSet. Revenue from Windows device makers fell 5 percent year over year in the worst results there in more than two years. On a conference call with analysts, Microsoft's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, attributed those results in part to the timing of the supply of processors to PC partners. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Surface revenue, at $1.86 billion, was up 39 percent.The company's Productivity and Business Process Segment -- including Dynamics, LinkedIn and Office -- generated $10.10 billion in revenue, coming in barely over the $10.09 billion FactSet analyst estimate. Office revenue from consumers was affected by the PC environment, along with ""some execution challenges we had,"" Hood said.And the Intelligent Cloud Segment, which includes Azure, enterprise services, SQL Server and Windows Server, posted revenue of $9.38 billion, beating the $9.28 billion estimate. In the past few years Microsoft's capital expenditures -- to support Azure and other products -- has risen sequentially from the fiscal first quarter to the fiscal second quarter, but this time it fell sequentially, going from $4.3 billion to $3.9 billion. In the quarter Microsoft had 33.3 million Office 365 consumer subscribers, up from 32.5 million in the fiscal first quarter. In December Microsoft had 64 million monthly active Xbox Live users, up from 57 million in September.Microsoft announced some notable cloud deals in the quarter including Gap and Walgreens. The company also acquired Glint and disclosed a change to its Edge browser strategy, a market where it competes with Google Chrome.In terms of guidance, Hood said Microsoft expects between $29.4 billion and $30.1 billion in revenue in the fiscal third quarter. The midpoint of that range is just below the Refinitiv consensus estimate of $29.87 billion. She said Microsoft expects ""continued market impact"" because of a more limited supply of chips, and she said the PC conditions could also hinder Office consumer revenue growth. Microsoft's stock rose slightly in extended trading after Hood provided guidance.Microsoft has been going back and forth with Amazon in recent weeks for the title of world's most valuable company by stock market value. The shares are up about 4 percent so far this year."

Analysts will also be looking for any signs as to whether Intel's recent cloud issues forebode any trouble for Microsoft.Microsoft stock, under CEO Satya Nadella, is up a whopping 13 percent over the last year. It also has the largest valuation of any U.S. public company over Amazon, Apple and Alphabet.The stock was up 2 percent heading into the results.In his preview note to clients, Morgan Stanley's Keith Weiss pointed out that, ""as IT focus shifts from pure Public Cloud to Hybrid Cloud architectures, Microsoft rises as the best positioned firm in tech.""Trading at 19 times the firm's 2020 estimate, shares are ""undervalued with 30 percent upside to our $140"" price target, Weiss added.Kash Rangan from Bank of America was a bit more restrained, saying, ""following several years of significant growth and stock price performance, the current macro outlook for slowing worldwide economic growth has some investors we speak to wondering how cyclical Microsoft is, whether its strong growth can continue.""UBS analyst Jennifer Lowe perhaps encapsulated most analysts' feelings, saying, ""Microsoft remains one of our favorite names for CY19, offering a balance of top-line growth, margin expansion"" and cheap valuation.Here's what the others expect:""We expect a beat in FQ2 driven mainly by seasonal strength in MPC segment (Gaming, Surface) and continued tailwinds in server products/Azure... However, we acknowledge the tough comp for the server products and windows segment in 2H... Beyond near-term growth headwinds (which we believe are adequately reflected in consensus expectations for sharply decelerating growth from 19% in Sept 18 to 10% in June 19), MSFT is ahead of sustained double-digit growth that could drive continued stock outperformance, in our view...""""Prompted by several investor inquiries concerning MSFT's underperformance YTD, we take this opportunity to elucidate the risks into 2019... To be clear, we expect another year of outperformance in the stock with 19% upside to our target price, but recognize 2018's success in high growth areas (Azure, Office 365) and high-margin business segments (Server products, Windows) will likely make for tougher compares ahead... Much of this is not Microsoft specific, but rather our expectations for decelerating growth across the industry in 2019 (See 2019 Software Outlook). In context, we firmly believe MSFT remains a steady long-term compounder, but see the magnitude of overachievement likely moderating in 2019...""""We anticipate continued strength in Commercial Cloud and ongoing improvement in Azure margins, while 62% total gross margins in the Xbox-heavy December Q should mark the bottom for the year... We believe Microsoft's Commercial Cloud business continues to grow well but investors are increasingly concerned that macro slowing could impact growth in Microsoft's more mature transactional businesses... We think this risk is mitigated by pricing even if units slow and by ongoing success with newer offerings, while valuation at ~21x EV/CY19E FCF looks defensive. MSFT remains one of our favorite names for CY19, offering a balance of top-line growth, margin expansion, and FCF-based valuation support...""""As Investor Debates Shift to Cyclical Topics, We See an Opportunity to Buy One of the Best Secularly Positioned Companies in Tech... Heading into 2019, investors' concerns are rising on the durability of software growth broadly, and the durability of the more cyclical aspects of the Microsoft portfolio (like PC exposed Windows OEM and Server exposed On-premise Server &amp; Tools) in particular... Our most recent CIO survey fielded in December suggests stable overall software growth into 2019, showed Microsoft a top share gainer of IT budget as workloads shift to the cloud, both today and over the next three years, and improving growth expectations for Microsoft's On-Premise Server Related Products – giving us confidence the strong secular demand trends driving Microsoft's topline should trump potential cyclical headwinds, which may arise in the year ahead...""""Bottom Line: We are revising our model ahead of MSFT's Q2/19 earnings report... Most of our estimate changes are due to our assumptions for incremental FX headwinds and lower growth in MPC, as well as other minor adjustments. We continue to forecast FY20 revenue growth of ~10%, which could prove to be conservative, and FCF growth in the low double-digits... We are maintaining our $125 target price and Outperform rating on MSFT, which remains one of our three favorite names and core holdings in software...""""The cloud and digital era coupled with leadership changes have transformed MSFT's model; cloud has risen to 27% of sales ($35B run-rate) from 5% in FY15 ($5B)... We expect continued cloud strength when MSFT reports on Wednesday with commercial cloud growth estimated at 44.8% y/y... We remain Overweight on MSFT as a top cloud stock to own for 2019, based on a strong balance sheet with $50B+ in net cash, improving margins, and double-digit growth prospects driven by a cloud franchise that could triple to $100B by CY23E."""

The congresswomen are asking Facebook, Microsoft and Google to reaffirm their commitment to a ""more sustainable future.""Ocasio-Cortez and Pingree's letter appear to be in response to a Mother Jones article from last week that noted Google, Facebook and Microsoft were sponsors of the convention earlier this month along with a group called the CO2 Coalition, which denies climate change and attempts to promote the supposed benefits of CO2 emissions.The three tech companies told Mother Jones in statements last week that they often sponsor events involving technology policy from across the political spectrum.In a statement to CNBC on Monday, Facebook pointed to a 2017 blog post about the company's political engagement and to the company's sustainability policies.A spokesperson for Google told CNBC the company sponsors ""organizations from across the political spectrum"" and that ""Google's sponsorship or collaboration with a third party organization doesn't mean that we endorse the organization's entire agenda or agree with other speakers or sponsors.""Microsoft, in a statement, said the company's engagement with LibertyCon was ""through a breakfast reception for student leaders to discuss topics including rural broadband and privacy.""""Climate change is one of the most important issues of our time, and our commitment to addressing it is unequivocal. For the past decade, we've reduced emissions, invested in renewable energy, supported policies to address climate change and enabled people around the globe to use technology to accelerate progress on this issue,"" the company said.

13,2019-01-25T15:39:30-0500,"Three of the four biggest companies — Microsoft, Amazon and Apple — all report in the week ahead, as do a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 and nearly half the Dow stocks.The big three tech stocks will be closely watched, both for their potential to affect the overall market and their comments on future growth, particularly after Apple's early warning.Profits are growing at just above 14 percent in the fourth quarter, but expectations have been coming down for the current quarter, and growth is now expected to be nearly flat at 2 percent, according to Refinitiv.The earnings season is about to get a lot more interesting with about a quarter of the S&amp;P 500, nearly half of the Dow Jones Industrials and three of the four biggest companies in the world reporting in the week ahead.Mega-cap tech companies Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon report respectively on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There will be heavy focus on them, not just because they are the biggest stocks — Microsoft first, then Amazon and Apple fourth — but because they represent growth and have been market leaders. Facebook, the sixth largest stock by market cap, also reports on Wednesday.The bar has already been lowered for Apple, after its warning of a revenue shortfall.""They're really important for a variety of reasons. Number one is their influence on the market. But also they're multinational companies, and they'll give us an idea of what's going on overseas. Growth is slowing dramatically and these overseas businesses are not going to be immune,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.About 72 percent of the companies that have reported earnings as of Friday morning have beaten expectations. In terms of revenue, however, there are just 58 percent that beat forecasts, down from about 70 percent in recent quarters. That means a much higher 42 percent have missed revenue expectations so far, according to Refinitiv data.Also concerning in the earnings data is the fact that first quarter earnings growth expectations have been shrinking, and are now nearly flat — at only 2 percent growth seen for S&amp;P 500 earnings in the current quarter, ending March 31. That number had been more than 5 percent on Jan. 1, and while it had been expected to slow, flat growth was not in most analysts' forecasts.The coming week's reports will come from a wide range of industries, including big energy with ExxonMobil and Chevron Friday; industrials like General Electric and Illinois ToolWorks and drug makers Merck and Pfizer.Earnings growth expectations for the fourth quarter have been just above 14 percent, including forecasts and actual reports of the companies that already reported.Lori Calvasina, RBC chief U.S. equity strategist, said tech will be an important group to watch. ""This has been one of the most problematic sectors since Dec. 31, in terms of earnings downgrades. There's been a lot of chatter out of semis this week. That had been the group in tech that was most derisked from an earnings expectations perspective. Expectations have really come down since last August, and since November came down very sharply,"" she said.Semiconductor stocks rallied in the past week, with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up 4.4 percent for the week, as of Friday. A number of semiconductor names, like Xilinx and Texas Instruments beat earnings forecasts, though sector heavyweight Intel was disappointing.Calvasina said she is concerned that earnings expectations for some other tech sectors may not have been adjusted downward enough. She said hardware company earnings forecasts had begun to come down in the fall, but there weren't many cuts to software sector profit forecasts. Calvasina said the companies where revisions were strong paved the way for a post-earnings stock pop, if the companies could beat lowered guidance.""In the first two weeks of January, the market tone was buy the dips. It's been a bit more of a cautionary tone this week. One of the things people have been cautious on, and are worrying about is whether the market can continue to climb higher, if it's favorite sector is seeing earnings downgrades,"" she said, pointing to the technology and communications services sectors.""I felt a lot better about that after hearing from financials reporting in week one. I read through those earnings call transcripts, and what I was seeing was there was a storm int he markets, there was a storm in fixed in come market in Q4 but that was not in the underlying economy,"" she said. ""In the first two weeks of January, nobody wanted to touch the financials, but now with the leadership rotation it does seem possible to me.""The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF was up 1.2 percent Friday, and is up 9.5 percent since Jan. 1.Some of the biggest names in the market are also, by default, among the most widely held names in many mutual funds portfolios. In a December RBC report, Microsoft was listed as the most widely held by large cap core, growth and value stock funds in the third quarter. Second was Alphabet, which reports earnings in the following week, and Apple was third.""When crowded names miss, they tend to be psychologically devastating. You always want to be extra vigilant on crowded names heading into reporting season,"" Calvasina said. ""Misses tend to get people off guard when they happen.""As for big tech earnings, Apple has already warned that its iPhone sales in China took a big hit, and analysts have lowered their expectations for earnings this quarter. They also expect iPhone sales weakness to continue into this year.Microsoft, on the other hand, has far less exposure to China, and Piper Jaffray analysts make a case for it to beat estimates, based on its historical performance.""The combination of top line outperformance and cost discipline has allowed for Microsoft to materially outperform on the bottom line. Although a repeat of performance is not guaranteed...we model a scenario in line with historical averages that supports EPS outperformance relative to guidance of ~$0.12 or EPS of $1.20,"" they wrote in a note.Cowen analysts expect Amazon will see revenue growth of 19 percent, to $72.1 billion, driven by e commerce, web services and advertising.The firm reiterated its outperform rating on the stock. ""We also forecast 4Q18 Operating Income (GAAP) to be ~14% above the high end of guidance, with ~17% incremental margins driven by AWS, the ramping high margin Ad biz and 3P mix shift,"" the Cowen analysts wrote.

15,2019-01-24T13:48:06-0500,"Confluent, which commercializes the Apache Kafka open-source software, spun out of LinkedIn in 2014.The start-up was LinkedIn's first corporate investment.Microsoft, which now owns LinkedIn, is benefiting from Confluent's rapid growth. When Microsoft bought LinkedIn for $27 billion in 2016, the deal brought with it a small equity investment that's turned into a surprising windfall.Two years before the acquisition, LinkedIn invested about $500,000 as part of a $6.9 million venture round in a fledgling spin-out called Confluent, which was setting out to commercialize the Apache Kafka open-source software. It was LinkedIn's first such investment, and valued Confluent at about $24 million.On Wednesday, Confluent said its valuation has swelled to $2.5 billion, based on a fresh $125 million investment led by Sequoia. That means the company is worth over 100 times more today than it was when LinkedIn wrote its check in 2014. LinkedIn's stake is now valued at about $25 million (a 50-fold increase), because its investment was diluted in future fundraising rounds, said a person with knowledge of the deal who asked not to be named because the size of LinkedIn's ownership was never disclosed.Confluent co-founder and CEO Jay Kreps, who started working at LinkedIn in 2007, declined to comment on the size of its stake. As a principal staff engineer at LinkedIn, Kreps led internal development of Apache Kafka, a data management tool that helps companies process and make sense of tons of information flooding into their systems in real time.The arrangement between LinkedIn and Confluent is similar to Yahoo's investment in data software company Hortonworks, which spun out of Yahoo in 2011. Hortonworks later went public and then merged with rival Cloudera in a deal that closed at the beginning of January. The combined company has a stock market value of $3.4 billion.Confluent and Hortonworks have even more in common. Benchmark and Index Ventures were early investors and major shareholders in each. Partners at both firms have said that Confluent is one of the fastest-growing enterprise companies they've ever seen. Confluent has exceeded $100 million in annual bookings, Forbes reported.tweetFor Microsoft, the Confluent stake remains such a tiny drop in the bucket, even after multiplying by many times, that the company has never discussed it publicly. At the end of the third quarter Microsoft had almost $136 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, including $2 billion in equity investments. And as of Thursday, Microsoft is the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world.But the profitable Confluent investment is yet another potential reason for Microsoft to tout the success of LinkedIn. The professional networking site's revenue more than doubled in Microsoft's latest fiscal year, growing faster than any other major product or service category. LinkedIn is contributing to the Commercial Cloud category that investors carefully monitor.LinkedIn's most notable equity investment since Confluent came in 2017, when it participated in a $300 million investment in Cornerstone OnDemand, which is publicly traded. The stock has since risen more than 40 percent.Microsoft has been a more active investor, including through its M12 corporate venture arm. Perhaps Microsoft's most famous investment came in 2007 in a company that, like LinkedIn, became known for digitally connecting people —Facebook.-- CNBC's Ari Levy contributed to this report.WATCH: Billionaire LinkedIn co-founder: Playing these board games as a kid led to my success"

Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.The deal could help Microsoft make its argument that it supports open-source technologies, particularly in the cloud, while continuing to make money from popular proprietary software like Windows and Office. In the cloud business, Microsoft wants to use openness as a way to pick up business amid competition from Google, market leader Amazon and others.Microsoft has also sought to bolster its reputation in the open-source world by making its products work better with the Linux operating system, which is widely used to run applications in public clouds. It also acquired GitHub last year in a $7.5 billion deal. GitHub is a place where developers collaborate on, explore and access open-source projects.Currently, Citus Data's website advertises a version of its database software that's hosted on Amazon Web Services. Microsoft's blog post announcing the acquisition mentions the competing Azure cloud 10 times.""Working together, we will accelerate the delivery of key, enterprise-ready features from Azure to PostgreSQL and enable critical PostgreSQL workloads to run on Azure with confidence,"" Rohan Kumar, corporate vice president for Azure data at Microsoft, wrote in the blog post.Microsoft doesn't have plans to change Citus Data's business at this time, a spokesman told CNBC in an email.Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether Microsoft will continue to offer the Citus Cloud offering on AWS.The start-up was founded in 2011 and had offices in San Francisco and Turkey, with 40 employees, according to LinkedIn data.

17,2019-01-24T08:45:13-0500,"Albertsons is bolstering its usage of MIcrosoft Azure and cloud software.Retailers and grocery chains have been migrating to Azure at a faster pace since Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods and expansion of Amazon Go stores.Microsoft's cloud business is taking full advantage of the growing fear of Amazon, announcing on Thursday its latest deal with a big retailer.Microsoft said it signed a three-year agreement with Albertsons, the supermarket chain and parent of Safeway and Vons, to make Microsoft Azure the grocer's preferred public cloud. The partnership comes a little over a week after Microsoft disclosed a seven-year deal with Walgreens.While Azure is a distant second to Amazon Web Services, it's winning large retail customers who are seeing Amazon's dominance in commerce expand by the day. In addition to Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired for $13.7 billion in 2017, the e-retailer has been opening up Amazon Go convenience stores, which promote cashierless technology, and has launched its own brands of over-the-counter health products and groceries.Anuj Dhanda, chief information officer of Albertsons, said Amazon's expansion has hastened his company's efforts to modernize its infrastructure and in-store experiences.Other than deploying on Azure and signing up employees with the Microsoft 365 bundle, Albertsons plans to use Microsoft's artificial-intelligence technology, and the two companies could team up on cashierless systems, which Albertsons has already been testing. ""We wouldn't want to develop the technology as much as Amazon would do, but we would say, 'How do we deploy the technology, how do we leverage it?'"" Dhanda said.Albertsons chose Azure to be its primary cloud because of its experience with big companies, history with large retailers and strong technical capabilities, and because it isn't a competitor, Dhanda said. Microsoft has picked up recent business from retailers like Gap, Walmart and Kroger.AWS, meanwhile, is still quite competitive in retail, providing its technology to companies including Brooks Brothers and Under Armour.Albertsons continues to run some of its own data center infrastructure. It has equipment located inside of stores, for example, in case of a loss of network connectivity. The company has been a Windows and Office customer and used Azure for certain workloads, and is now expanding its reliance on the Microsoft cloud, including for the deployment of a mobile app that consumers can use to pump and pay for gas.Dhanda said Albertsons prefers that the cloud software vendors the company uses also run on providers other than AWS, but they don't have to use Azure.""We're not, I would say, quote-unquote religious,"" Dhanda said.WATCH: Why this investor likes Microsoft"

It has been increasingly calling for rules to be established to prevent human rights violations and discrimination.The technology is included in many new smartphones including Apple's new iPhone models and Samsung's latest Galaxy phones. A primary purpose of facial recognition so far has been to identify users with biometric authentication to bolster the security of devices.But growing worries over the ability of countries like China to use it to spy on citizens have led to increasing calls for regulatory oversight.Chinese artificial intelligence giant SenseTime, for instance, is known to provide its face identification tech to help the police identify suspected criminals. The firm says on its website that Guangzhou's public security bureau has managed to identify over 2,000 crime suspects since 2017 with the help of SenseTime's technology.Nadella also called for global privacy regulation. The Microsoft boss lauded the European Union's new GDPR data privacy law which was introduced last year, calling it a ""fantastic start.""But he said that an overhaul of data protection legislation shouldn't stop with Europe, and that the U.S. and the rest of the world should also follow suit.""I am hopeful that in the United States we will have something that's along the same lines,"" Nadella said. ""In fact, I hope that the world over we all converge on a common standard.""""Because one of the things we do not want to do is fragment the world and increase transaction cost.""Last year was a particularly notable one in regard to controversy surrounding the sharing of data and violations of privacy. Facebook was — and to a large extent, still is — at the center of a scandal surrounding the way it let political consultancy Cambridge Analytica gain access to the data of 87 million people.That particular case saw politicians and regulators cracking down and increasing scrutiny of the tech sector.Various company executives — including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Google's Sundar Pichai and Twitter's Jack Dorsey — appearing before lawmakers to testify on a multitude of issues, not least including the misuse of personal information.More scrutiny over data practices in the industry also landed Facebook and others with fines. The U.K.'s data watchdog slapped the social media giant with a £500,000 ($652,000) fine over its handling of user data, while the French privacy authority recently hit Google with a 50 million euro ($57 million) fine for allegedly breaching GDPR.WATCH:VR training by Microsoft and Pixo VR saving millions and saving lives"

The Microsoft Classroom Pen, introduced Tuesday, is designed to work on the smaller Surface Go tablet, but is compatible with other Surface devices, as well as certain Windows PCs from other manufacturers.The device was designed with a student's needs in mind, part of Microsoft's effort to stave off threats from the likes of Apple and Google in the education market. The stylus is shorter than Microsoft's current Surface Pen, the tip is more durable, and it has fewer moving parts. There's even a slot for tethering it to a PC, so it's less likely to get lost.Microsoft's hardware team spent time with students in classrooms as they developed the product, said Eran Megiddo, the company's corporate vice president for education, in an interview.""They are the future as far as leaders, employees and consumers,"" Megiddo said of students. ""They're definitely the ones that are adopting technology the quickest.""The stylus will get bundled in classroom packs that schools can order from Microsoft. Currently there's no other way to order the digital pen, but Megiddo said that some early users have already suggested that it be made available to anyone.They'll be sold in packs of 20 for about $800, or around $40 each. (The Surface Pen costs about $100.) The stylus will go on sale next month and will be available in all 36 countries where Microsoft offers the Surface Go.Megiddo highlighted other areas where Microsoft is focusing on education. For example, in 2017 Microsoft gave Word the ability to read text out loud to users. Now students will also be able to have Word and other programs read out math equations.Non-Microsoft products are also part of the strategy.

A change to the Windows 10 Mobile support page was first spotted by Thurrott, a site that covers Microsoft.Microsoft said that on Dec. 10, 2019, it will stop sending ""new security updates, non-security hotfixes, free assisted support options, or technical content updates from Microsoft for free."" In other words, there aren't going to be any more updates, and only a few phone models will even be supported until that final date.""With the Windows 10 Mobile OS end of support, we recommend that customers move to a supported Android or iOS device,"" Microsoft said. ""Microsoft's mission statement to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, compels us to support our Mobile apps on those platforms and devices.""Microsoft has put a lot of effort into both the iPhone and Android, where its Office products are available.

At the time, it held a parade and declared that both BlackBerry and iPhone were dead.Microsoft also acquired Nokia's mobile unit so that it could build Windows Phone products internally. That too was a failure, and Microsoft eventually wrote down its $7.6 billion Nokia acquisition.There are lots of reasons Windows failed on mobile. The largest was probably because there weren't enough apps, including popular ones that were also available on Android and iPhone. Terry Myerson, the former head of Windows Phone, talked a bit about its failure in March of last year.""We had a differentiated experience, but it's so clear in hindsight that the disruption in business model which Android represented was enormous, and that building our early versions of Windows Phone on an incomplete Windows CE platform, designed for small embedded systems, left us too hobbled to ever catch up,"" Myerson said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."

26,2019-01-17T13:46:46-0500,"The comments come a month after a report about a consumer version of Microsoft 365.The Microsoft CEO talked up Microsoft's opportunity in gaming.Microsoft is working on a new bundle of software for consumers, following the launch of its Microsoft 365 package for workers. CEO Satya Nadella hinted at it in a meeting with journalists at company headquarters on Monday.The remark appears in the context of Nadella's response to a question about what Microsoft will do in the near future to serve consumers. Nadella's Microsoft has reduced focus on things like Windows for smartphones and doubled down on, among other things, selling Office subscriptions and renting out the Azure public cloud to meet businesses' computing needs.But at the Monday event, Nadella made it clear that it still very much cares about consumers. And a new software package is part of that.""It's very fair to say, as I said in the very beginning, that we started after all on the consumer side and then over-indexed to the IT side, and we definitely are very focused on bringing that back,"" Nadella said, according a transcript of the event circulated by Ben Thompson's Stratechery newsletter.Nadella pointed to Microsoft's collection of Surface devices as an example.""Surface is doing well because ultimately people do have a special connection with the device they use,"" Nadella said. In the most recent fiscal year, Microsoft's Surface revenue totaled $4.7 billion, representing about 4 percent of total revenue.Microsoft also has an advertising business, which addresses consumers, partly in the Bing search engine.""We have all kinds of strategic flexibility to do things that would perhaps be more amenable to both the end users as well as the advertisers and publishers, so we expect to do things even in that space,"" Nadella said.The CEO also hinted at the potential of a Microsoft 365 collection of products for consumers, although he stopped short of saying what it might include, when it will become available and how much people will have to pay for it. (Microsoft didn't respond to a request for comment about that.) The comments came a month after ZDNet reported on plans along these lines.""So I would say Surface is a brand, what we are doing with Office 365 or what we will soon be talking about as Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions, those would be again completely consumer businesses,"" Nadella said.Microsoft introduced Microsoft 365 in mid-2017. It's a way to give employees Windows 10, the Office 365 portfolio of subscription-based productivity applications, and Enterprise Mobility + Security, a grouping that comes with identity and device management tools. Earlier this week Microsoft announced a deal with Walgreens Boots Alliance that will bring this software collection to some 380,000 employees.Microsoft carefully tracks the number of devices running Windows 10, as well as the number of people who subscribe to Office 365. It's conceivable that one or both of those could be part of Microsoft 365 aimed at non-business use.Another part of the package could potentially be gaming, given that Nadella also spent some time on Monday talking about that subject. The company has a subscription business called Game Pass and is readying a service for streaming games from the cloud.""We have a structural position in that we have both a console business as well as a PC business which happens to be in fact bigger than the console business when it comes to gaming, and the idea is to aggregate those sockets with a subscription service,"" Nadella said. ""We won't be the only ones, there will be competition just like with other content, there may be a few subscriptions that will be successful, so we are going to go after it.""WATCH: Microsoft and Walgreens unveil 7-year partnership agreement"

In comparison, the amount dwarfs the $100 million in annual funding for Washington state's Housing Trust Fund.It's too early to say exactly how much affordable housing will ultimately result from the $500 million, Microsoft officials said. Smith said the company, based in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, hopes to leverage the fund to help create ""tens of thousands of units.""The initiative comes as Microsoft and other tech giants that have driven the region's economic boom face increasing pressure to help mitigate affordable-housing shortages. Microsoft is coupling its contributions with a call for other companies to step up, and for Seattle's Eastside suburbs — of which Redmond is one — to facilitate more housing.The company, which plans a news conference Thursday, will split the funds three ways.Microsoft will loan $225 million at below-market interest rates to help developers facing high land and construction costs build and preserve ""workforce housing"" on the Eastside, where the company has 50,000 workers and is planning for more. The developments will be aimed at households making between $62,000 and $124,000 per year.Another $250 million will go toward market-rate loans for construction of affordable housing across the Puget Sound region for people making up to 60 percent of the local median income ($48,150 for a two-person household). The remaining $25 million will be donated to services for the region's low-income and homeless residents.Smith said he views the fund as an acknowledgment of the economic realities faced by low-salary workers at the company and elsewhere in King County. ""At some level we as a region are going to need to either say there are certain areas where we're comfortable having more people live, or we just want permanently to force the people who are going to teach our kids in schools, and put out the fires in our houses and keep us alive in the hospital, to spend four hours every day getting to and from work,"" he said.

While the news that Kurian would replace former CEO Diane Greene was announced last November, he only formally took on the role this year.The price bumps — from $5 to $6 per user / month for G Suite's Basic Edition plan and from $10 to $12 per user / month for its Business Edition tier — will take effect on April 2 and bring Google's product costs closer to those of rival suite Microsoft Office 365. (The features of the various pricing tiers from Google and Microsoft aren't directly comparable. The differences between Google's basic and business tiers involve storage space, among other features.) Pricing for Google's Enterprise Edition will remain the same and Google will continue to offer free accounts for non-business users.In a blog post introducing the new pricing Google says that over the last ten years, G Suite has grown to provide more products.""The one thing that hasn't changed over this time is price,"" the post says.While Google doesn't break out its cloud market share or how much the business makes, it said in February 2018 that the cloud unit overall had passed $1 billion in revenue per quarter. Even with that disclosure, it's unclear how much revenue is coming from G Suite versus Google's Cloud Platform. Google's public cloud marketshare is widely seen as lagging behind both Amazon and Microsoft's.In Alphabet's Q3 earnings, it reported $4.64 billion in its ""other revenues"" category, which includes its cloud business as well as app store revenue and hardware sales. It will next report earnings on February 4.Google says that the price changes will not impact current contracts or renewals made before April 2."

On Tuesday Microsoft said it has signed a multiyear deal with Walgreens Boots Alliance.Amazon's core business still lies in e-commerce — it has expanded in brick-and-mortar retailing through Amazon Go Stores, its Whole Foods acquisition and other efforts — and at times that's proving to be an advantage to Amazon's competitors in the cloud business. In the case of Walgreens, Amazon's recent push into health care looms large. Although the company has kept its intentions closely guarded, it's making moves like acquiring online pharmacy PillPack and teaming up with J.P. Morgan and Berkshire Hathaway on a long-term plan to improve care and reduce costs for employees.WBA CEO and Executive Vice Chairman Stefano Pessina said he's not afraid of Amazon moving into the space.""If they will come, they will create another ecosystem and people will live together,"" Pessina told CNBC's Jon Fortt in an interview announcing the news.

35,2019-01-11T09:00:56-0500,"Competition is brewing among Amazon, Google and Microsoft in a different corner of the cloud market: gaming. Amazon is planning a gaming service, but it probably won't become available before 2020, according to a new report.Google is testing a new service.Microsoft launched the Xbox almost two decades ago and bought a cloud gaming company last year.Amazon, Microsoft and Google are in the midst of an intense battle to win business from companies moving their workloads to the cloud. Now, there's brewing competition among them in a very different corner of the cloud market: gaming.Microsoft has long been a gaming powerhouse, having introduced the Xbox console in 2000. In expanding how and where people can play games, Microsoft said in October that it will start testing a cloud gaming offering this year. Its Project xCloud will work on mobile devices. That announcement followed the acquisition last January of PlayFab, a start-up that provides game developers with cloud-based tools.Amazon has kept quiet about its ambitions in the market. But The Information reported on Thursday that the company has held conversations with publishers about releasing games on a new service as early as 2020. That project would build on previous efforts to support game developers. Amazon declined to comment on the report.Google, meanwhile, has started testing a cloud gaming service — under the name Project Stream — with a limited number of users.It's the latest example of the three massive U.S. infrastructure companies putting their technology to work in a way that lets customers offload their computing and storage needs so they can do more without relying on expensive hardware.But these companies aren't all equal. And when it comes to gaming, Microsoft has a home-field advantage.""Amazon is not a gaming company. Google isn't. Sony is a gaming company, but they don't have a cloud presence,"" said Steve Perlman, former CEO of cloud gaming company OnLive. ""Then you have Microsoft — Microsoft has both of those things.""Perlman knows the challenges this market presents. He founded OnLive in 2007, and ultimately sold assets to Sony in 2015, a year after Sony announced a game streaming service, PlayStation Now. Earlier in his career, Perlman sold WebTV to Microsoft, and some members of that team worked on Microsoft's Xbox 360 console.When Perlman jumped into game streaming over a decade ago, it was possible to play games by connecting to remote servers, but it never reached a mass market. Apple and Google hadn't yet become dominant mobile players with app stores, and publishers weren't focusing on developing games for the cloud.Still, the technology did attract some users. Even though there could be a lag in some high-performance competitive gaming scenarios, OnLive ran tests and found that people generally couldn't tell the difference between games running remotely and games running locally, according to Perlman.At that time, he said, Microsoft was more interested in console sales.""We had some conversations with them"" about cloud gaming, Perlman said.

50,2018-12-31T16:06:00-0500,"This year Microsoft was one of the top gainers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.Microsoft eclipsed Apple as the world's most valuable public company by market cap on Nov. 30.Microsoft has not had a tremendous quarter. But it has still succeeded in regaining a coveted title: most valuable public U.S. company by market cap.And even though Microsoft's product announcements still might not rivet the public like Apple's keynotes, the company has moved forward in measurable ways in 2018, following years of transition under CEO Satya Nadella.Nadella's Microsoft, which has prioritized things like the cloud, open-source software and cross-platform services and has de-emphasized Windows, was arguably synthesized in a remark he offered in an interview with CNET. ""You join here not to be cool, but to make others cool,"" he said.It's now been one month since Microsoft captured the most-valuable-public-company title from Apple. This is the first time Microsoft is ending the year as the world's highest valued public company since 2002.The fourth quarter hasn't been the best quarter in history for the company. (That was the first quarter of 1987, when the stock price doubled.) In fact, this was one of its poorer quarters through the years. The stock was caught up in a wider market selloff, and it declined by 11 percent this quarter.And yet, Microsoft was discounted less than other top companies. Amazon fell 25 percent in the fourth quarter, and Apple went down 30 percent.For all of 2018, shares of Microsoft rose almost 19 percent. It stands out as one of the top five components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average for the year. At the end of 2018, Microsoft's market cap stood at $779.7 billion as the stock closed at $101.57 per share.Microsoft has had a strong year. It continued its streak of exceeding analysts' estimates for earnings and revenue with each of its earnings reports.Its June GitHub acquisition, the third most expensive in the company's 43-year history, behind LinkedIn and Skype, has been well received.""The rationale for acquiring the asset is appealing, in our opinion,"" Piper Jaffray analysts led by Alex Zukin wrote in a September note. ""For Microsoft, developer mind share and wallet share is paramount. Microsoft believes that developers will have an outsized voice at the table in the age of digital transformation and that this was the most important reason for the acquisition. Secondarily, the company also believes that they can drive increased GitHub monetization.""Meanwhile, gaming became a $10 billion business for Microsoft for the first time. The LinkedIn business doubled and is now generating more than $5 billion in annual revenue. Surface hardware revenue is approaching the $5 billion mark.

62,2018-12-23T18:08:57-0500,"Microsoft mentioned the Font Maker app in a blog post for people testing early versions of Windows 10 in June.The app generates TrueType fonts, which can be used in various applications like Word on Windows and Mac computers.Microsoft didn't make a big deal about it, but it released a very cool application called Font Maker this year. It lets you create a font out of your own handwriting.The app only works on newer versions of Windows 10, and you can only use it with a stylus on a touchscreen device. Plus, it's only intended for English at the moment.While it's not going to bring in a whole lot of money, like Office or Windows or Azure, it's a lot of fun to use, and typing in your very own font once you're finished is endlessly rewarding.In fact, I'm writing this article now in my custom font inside the Visual Studio Code text editor. But I can also use it in other apps, like Word or Evernote. I can even use it on other computers, even Macs, because every time you create a new font, it generates a file in TrueType format, which isn't limited to Windows.I'll show you how it works.First, download the app from the Microsoft Store.When you open it, you'll see a screen showing little boxes, one for each letter, capital and lowercase. There are also boxes for numbers and punctuation marks.Grab a stylus and start writing in your version of each letter. You'll want to be careful to keep your letters within the lines of the boxes, so that your font doesn't end up looking strange. If you screw up a letter, don't worry -- if you have a stylus like the Surface Pen that comes with an eraser option, you can use that.Once you're satisfied with all of your letters, hit Next.Then you'll see boxes where you can write three sentences or phrases. Write these out, again making sure to keep your letters within the bounds of the lines. And yes, you can use your eraser here, too. Hit ""Next"" when you're done.Now you'll see a version of your font, but if it doesn't look right, don't worry. There are sliders on the bottom of the window that will let you change important aspects of the font: the amount of space between characters, the amount of space between whole words, and overall font size.Once the app generates your font, you'll be able to use it in various sizes, but the space adjustments won't be adjustable later. So move the sliders until the font looks natural to you.If you see a letter that doesn't look quite right here, unfortunately there's no back button, so you'll have to make a whole new font if you want to redo it. The whole process doesn't take a very long time, though, so don't agonize too much over it. When you're ready, hit Create.Save your font as a TrueType file, which will use the .TTF format. If you'd like to try out your own font on your current PC, find the file in File explorer and open it up. Hit Install, and close the window. (You'll now be able to access it by going to Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization &gt; Fonts.) Then open an application where you can select a font, and see how you did!You'll probably get a kick out of typing and seeing the very characters you made show up on screen. But take a minute and type out every letter, in capital and lowercase, as well as numbers and punctuation marks. Look carefully and see if there are any letters that don't fully show up. I've seen this happen with longer letters, like lowercase g or q. If you come across letters you're not happy with, go back to Font Maker and try again, while you're still familiar with it. Rinse and repeat until you have a font you truly love to use.And of course, there's no stopping you from making a whole bunch of fonts using different lettering styles. For example, you can make yourself a wide font. Or you can pass off your PC to friends and family members and see what they come up with.Enjoy!WATCH: Traders make bullish bets on Microsoft"

The flaw could allow broad access to systems running certain Internet Explorer browsers. It's a rare ""emergency patch"" by Microsoft, issued because it is currently being exploited ""in the wild,"" according to the Department of Homeland Security. Criminals are currently exploiting a newly found flaw in several popular versions of Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, according to the company, security researchers at Google and the Department of Homeland Security.Attackers can use the vulnerability to gain broad access to computer systems, according to the U.S. Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT). The flaw works by driving users to an infected website via a fraudulent ""phishing"" email, according to the CERT. Once there, you unknowingly download malware that grants the attacker rights to any system you are able to access, according to Microsoft.""An attacker could then install programs; view, change or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights,"" Microsoft said in an update on the vulnerability.The issue was discovered by Google's Threat Analysis Team, Microsoft said. The flaw affects older Internet Explorer browser versions including Windows 7 and 10 and Windows Server 2012, 2016 and 2019 versions of Explorer 11, Explorer 10 for Windows Server 2012 and Explorer 9 for Windows Server 2008, according to Carnegie Mellon's Software Engineering Institute.The issue is also significant because it comes as companies prepare for the weekend before Christmas, one of the busiest shopping days of the year, said Jason Escaravage, cyber defense lead for the commercial practice at consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton.""If I'm a bad guy, I would likely target a group of people at a company with a phishing campaign that, for instance, offers them 50% off with an online shopping platform,"" he said. ""Once they link to the [fraudulent] site, they can have their current session hijacked.""Escaravage advised individuals to ensure their Internet Explorer browsers are updated, as well as other applications: ""Make sure you are always operating on the latest version of anything that is touching the internet,"" said Escaravage.

The S&amp;P industrial index dropped 1.32 percent.Nvidia tumbled 14.8 percent after the chipmaker cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars on weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected data center sales.The Philadelphia semiconductor index slumped 2.41 percent, while the S&amp;P technology index dropped 1.77 percent.""People had some optimism last week on earnings when numbers were pretty good, and today it's clearly gone the other way. China is such a big part of so many companies' earnings picture,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.Also hurting global investor sentiment, China data showed earnings at industrial firms shrank for a second straight month in December, hit by slowing prices and weak factory activity amid a protracted trade war with the United States.As signs of a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy become stark, investors are pinning their hopes for a compromise between Washington and Beijing on trade when officials meet later this week.""With the Chinese economy struggling the way it is and with companies feeling the impact, the U.S. is also starting to realize that there is enough motivation to get a deal done. It's just a question of when,"" said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada.Although earnings have largely surpassed Wall Street's expectations, helping the S&amp;P 500 climb about 12 percent from its December lows, worries about slowing global growth have tempered expectations.With Wall Street in the thick of quarterly results this week, 72.6 percent of companies that have already reported have exceeded profit estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Since the reporting season kicked off two weeks ago, analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter profit growth have stayed steady at about 14 percent, but expectations for 2019 earnings growth has dropped to 5.6 percent from 6.3 percent.At 2:30 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.17 percent at 24,448.34 points, while the S&amp;P 500 had lost 1.08 percent to 2,635.87.The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.38 percent to 7,066.33.Nine of the 11 major S&amp;P sector indexes were lower.

The report on Tuesday also said it permitted Microsoft's Bing search engine to view the names of nearly all of a Facebook user's friends without consent.Facebook said it enabled partner companies like Spotify to access users' private messages after a user had signed into Facebook through the partner company's app.Spokespeople for Spotify and Netflix told the Times they were unaware of the broad powers Facebook had granted them, while an Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) spokesperson disputed the bank had such access.Facebook stock was down more than 2 percent on Wednesday morning, as most other tech stocks were rallying.The Times report, citing hundreds of internal documents and interviews with more than 50 former employees, also said Facebook allowed Amazon to obtain users' names and contact information through their friends, while Yahoo was able to view streams of friends' posts as recently as this summer. The report suggests Facebook's sharing of personal data extended well beyond what the social media giant had previously disclosed.In all, the Times report said Facebook's data-sharing arrangements benefited more than 150 companies.

But it admitted the software components for the service were left in place after it shut down, potentially allowing developers to continue accessing users' personal information. Facebook said it has ""no evidence data was used or misused after the program was shut down.""Facebook has been embroiled in a series of scandals this year over how it handles users' personal data.

The MTUM is only down 3 percent so it's a way to kind of get a little bit more diversification and protect the downside,"" he explained.The MTUM has not outpaced the XLC ETF so far this year as Facebook and Netflix rallies gave rise to big gains for the communications sector.

75,2018-12-07T10:18:05-0500,"Microsoft's Azure cloud is second only to Amazon Web Services in the market.Microsoft doesn't release revenue figures for Azure, but it does disclose growth rates.KeyBanc analysts now estimate that Azure will deliver $26.4 billion in revenue in the 2021 fiscal year, while the contribution from Windows will total $20.3 billion.While Microsoft is arguably best known for being the company behind Windows, its cloud business could soon be a bigger deal in terms of revenue.In a note distributed to clients on Thursday, KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts Brent Bracelin and Clarke Jeffries estimated that Microsoft's Azure public cloud will generate more revenue than Windows in the 2021 fiscal year.Microsoft wasn't first to market in the public cloud, which involves charging customers for the use of computing and storage resources provided from Microsoft' data centers located around the world. Amazon introduced its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud years earlier, and today AWS is the leader of the market, while Azure is in second place.Microsoft has placed a higher priority on cloud under CEO Satya Nadella and increased its support for open-source technologies like Linux. ""This budding love affair for open-source is partially tied to cloud economics with Azure revenue posed to exceed Windows in three years,"" wrote Bracelin and Jefferies.Although Microsoft still doesn't say how much revenue Azure is bringing in each quarter, the company does regularly talk about Azure's growth rate. In October, the company said that in the first quarter of its 2019 fiscal year, which ended in that month, Azure revenue increased 76 percent.Across the 2018 fiscal year, which ended in June, Microsoft's Windows revenue came out to $19.5 billion, representing 17.7 percent of the entirety of the company's revenue The KeyBanc analysts think that in that period, Azure had $7.1 billion in revenue, or 6.4 percent of the pie.The KeyBanc analysts believe Azure will grow almost 72 percent in the 2019 fiscal year, with $12.2 billion in revenue. They think Azure will represent 9.7 percent of total revenue for the company, while Windows will grow more than 2 percent at $20 billion in revenue, or 16 percent of the total.In the 2020 fiscal year, the analysts think this pattern of strong Azure growth and slight Windows growth will continue, even if Windows will still be larger than Azure, at $20.1 billion and $18.5 billion, respectively.Bracelin and Jeffries see the shift happening in the 2021 fiscal year. They predict that Azure will do $26.4 billion in revenue, up 42.5 percent, and Windows will have revenue of $20.3 billion, up just 1 percent.At that time, Azure will account for 16.6 percent of Microsoft's business, and Windows will be 12.8 percent of it, according to the analysts' projections.""Windows has been an integral aspect of the PC and server landscape for 30+ years and will likely continue to be. However, the cloud-first era has opened up a much larger TAM opportunity for Microsoft beyond Windows, in our view, as evident in the bold moves that Microsoft has made over the last four years, punctuated by the acquisition of GitHub for $7.5B and the contribution of 60K patents to the OIN [Open Innovation Network] last month,"" Bracelin and Jeffries wrote.The analysts estimate that GitHub has 73 percent of the code-hosting market. They peg Atlassian's competing Bitbucket product at 10 percent and privately-held GitLab at 17 percent.WATCH: Microsoft CEO on GitHub acquisition"
76,2019-02-04T13:13:28-0500,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was seen in attendance at the Super Bowl on Sunday — in the commissioner's booth.For football fans who root for teams in different markets from where they live, Amazon could be the key to opening up viewing options.Nobody wants to talk about football today after the pathetic excuse for a Super Bowl on Sunday, the lowest-scoring NFL championship game ever. While New England fans never tire of watching Commissioner Roger Goodell hand the Lombardi Trophy to Patriots owner Robert Kraft or of seeing Tom Brady win yet another ring, the rest of America tuned out this year. It was the lowest-rated Super Bowl in a decade.The most interesting thing to happen during the game wasn't on the field. It happened when CBS panned to the commissioner's booth to reveal Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos schmoozing with Goodell and some other bigwigs.Seattle Seahawks fans speculated that Bezos might be in attendance to bend Goodell's ear about buying the team from Jodi Allen, the sister of late owner and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who died last year. But there's a more exciting possibility.What if the world's wealthiest person was in Atlanta to lay the groundwork for Amazon taking over the NFL's Sunday Ticket deal from AT&amp;T's DirecTV? That could be a dream come true for NFL fans everywhere, especially those (like me) who live in TV markets outside of where their favorite team plays.For those of you who aren't NFL football fans, an explanation is in order. Each Sunday during the regular season, between three and 10 games air during the two main slots at 1 p.m. and around 4 p.m. Eastern time. All of those games are televised. But NFL rules require local stations to broadcast the game being played by any team in that TV market. No other games can supersede that game. So if you live in San Francisco, like me, you'll be forced to watch the execrable Oakland Raiders (as long as they're still here) and San Francisco 49ers (who now play in Santa Clara), even though I'm a die-hard Seahawks fan.The way around this, until now, has been through the NFL Sunday Ticket, which is only available to DirecTV subscribers. I'd have to cancel my cable, sign up for DirecTV, and then pay an additional $300 (or more) for four months of Sunday Ticket, which gives me the right to watch every game.But even if I wanted to swap cable for DirecTV, I don't want to watch every game. I want to watch Seahawks games, and maybe the occasional conference game that affects Seattle's playoff chances.The other option is to go a bar — Danny Coyle's on Haight Street is the Seahawks bar in San Francisco — but that means I don't get to watch with my 8-year-old son. There are also illegal streams available via Reddit, but they're unreliable, plagued by interruptions and pop-up windows. Or so I hear.DirecTV's deal with the NFL expires in 2022.What I'd like to see is for Amazon to take over, then negotiate with the NFL to blast apart the all-or-nothing bundle for out-of-market games, and instead sell them a la carte. I'd pay $20 every week the Seahawks aren't televised locally just to watch from the couch with my son. I'm sure many other casual football fans are in the same situation. The hardcore fans who need to watch every game to keep track of their fantasy players will still pay top dollar, but the NFL is passing up extra cash from people like me.I can only hope Bezos was making the same argument to Goodell on Sunday.WATCH: Super Bowl ad winners and losers"
77,2018-12-06T13:13:45-0500,"Despite a recent rumor, the company isn't getting rid of Edge, which was introduced in Windows 10 and is now available on Android and iOS.Microsoft will start using Chromium, the open-source project behind the Chrome browser, to further develop Edge.Edge will also come to all supported versions of Windows, along with Apple's macOS.Microsoft's web browsing technology is coming back to the Mac.On Thursday Microsoft said that its Edge browser, which was introduced in 2015 as part of Windows 10, will be coming to the Mac as part of a broader rethinking of the company's browser strategy.Edge was one of the biggest new features of Windows 10 when it became available in mid-2015. But it hasn't taken off, despite Microsoft's attempts to promote it in its own properties, like the Bing search engine. Google's Chrome had around 62 percent share in November, while Edge had about 2 percent, according to StatCounter. Apple's Safari had 15 percent, and Microsoft's old browser, Internet Explorer, had 3 percent share.In the past few years, under the leadership of Satya Nadella, Microsoft has come to embrace open-source technologies more openly. It has added broader support for Linux in Windows and in the cloud, for example. Now, after depending heavily on its own browsing engine technology, Microsoft will make Chromium, the open-source heart of Google's Chrome browser, a key part of Edge, essentially acknowledging that Google's technology has become dominant.Microsoft will also become a major contributor to the Chromium project as it looks to make Edge even more widely available.""Microsoft Edge will now be delivered and updated for all supported versions of Windows and on a more frequent cadence,"" Microsoft Windows corporate vice president Joe Belfiore wrote in a blog post on Thursday. That language implies Edge will become available for Windows 7, for one thing.One recent report previously detailed Microsoft's Chromium adoption plans and suggested that the company would release a browser to replace Edge. Instead, the company is refining Edge, to benefit multiple constituencies.""People using Microsoft Edge (and potentially other browsers) will experience improved compatibility with all web sites, while getting the best-possible battery life and hardware integration on all kinds of Windows devices,"" Belfiore wrote in the blog post.""Web developers will have a less-fragmented web platform to test their sites against, ensuring that there are fewer problems and increased satisfaction for users of their sites; and because we'll continue to provide the Microsoft Edge service-driven understanding of legacy IE-only sites, Corporate IT will have improved compatibility for both old and new web apps in the browser that comes with Windows.""This isn't the first time Microsoft is building for the Mac, and it certainly isn't the first time Microsoft is packaging up a browser for Apple's Mac operating system. Apple offered Internet Explorer for the Mac but said it would stop coming out with new versions of the software in 2003.Microsoft expects to have a preview build for people to try in early 2019, Belfiore wrote.WATCH: Microsoft CEO: We welcome every cloud provider"
78,2018-12-05T16:37:37-0500,"Microsoft executive Phil Spencer joined the company's inner circle of top leaders last year.In the company's most recent fiscal year, which ended in June, gaming represented 9.4 percent of total revenue.Microsoft has been in the gaming business since the turn of the century. Finally it matters to the company from a financial standpoint.""Amy Hood, our CFO, she likes to tell me I've made the spreadsheet now, and she says that can be a good thing, and I'm on the spreadsheet. So she's going to pay attention,"" Microsoft's executive vice president for gaming, Phil Spencer, said on stage at the Barclays Global Technology, Media and Telecommunications Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday.Today Microsoft is one of the top public companies by market capitalization, alongside Amazon and Apple. Sales of Xbox consoles and online services means Microsoft is less dependent on revenue from other products, like Windows, Office and enterprise software. In its 2018 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, Microsoft surpassed $10 billion in gaming revenue for the first time. Spencer, who joined Microsoft's senior leadership team alongside Hood and CEO Satya Nadella last year, pointed to several investments the company has made in gaming recently, building on earlier moves like the $2.5 billion Mojang acquisition. and its purchase of game-streaming company Beam, which has since been rebranded to Mixer.""We've acquired and started seven new first-party studios in the last year. We obviously don't do that without tremendous support from Satya and Amy,"" Spencer said. ""We understand content is a critical component of what we're trying to go build and the support from the company has been tremendous.""One of Microsoft's stated growth opportunities in the future is cloud-based gaming, which could make the technical limitations of consumers' devices less important and expose Microsoft's gaming content for wider consumption. Spencer talked loosely about its cloud gaming initiative, called, Project xCloud, on Wednesday.""We focus first on an Android phone because there's over a billion Android phones on the planet and it's a place that the content that we've natively built up over the past decades on our platform hasn't been able to reach,"" Spencer said.This strategy builds on Microsoft's past efforts to bring richer capabilities to Android. But Google, the company behind Android, has started working on cloud gaming with its Project Stream initiative, Spencer said. And meanwhile Amazon, which is the leader of the cloud infrastructure market, has its own gaming division, he said.""We'll have multiple business models that will work with streaming, but the connection of streaming with the subscription model makes a ton of sense,"" Spencer said. ""You see it in music. You see it in video. So you can look at Project xCloud and you can look at something like Game Pass, and you can see there's natural synergies.""On stage, Barclays asked Spencer how Microsoft differentiates from gaming subscription offerings from EA and Sony.""For us, it's all about how we reach 2 billion gamers,"" Spencer said. ""If you build the market around a couple hundred million people that are going to own a game console or a high-end gaming PC, then your business model diversity can actually narrow because your customers are narrow. But when you think about reaching a customer with this content where their only compute device could be an Android phone, you think about, well, what are all the ways that that person pays for content if they do at all today?""Microsoft will bring its Game Pass subscription service to PCs, and eventually it will be available on every device, Spencer said."
79,2019-01-31T12:54:00-0500,"(Adds quotes from CEO interview, stock moves of rivals)Jan 31 (Reuters) - Intel Corp made interim Chief Executive Officer Robert Swan's role permanent on Thursday, marking the first time the chipmaker has picked a leader who did not rise through the company ranks, sending Intel shares down and boosting rivals.Swan, 58, who was previously Intel's chief financial officer, served as eBay Inc's CFO for nine years before a stint in private equity and joining Intel in 2016.His career in corporate finance marks a sharp break from tradition at Intel, which has typically been led by engineers who spent decades at the company and time in both its microchip architecture and manufacturing businesses.Intel shares fell 2.6 percent to $46.29 in midday trading and shares of competing chip firms gained.Advanced Micro Devices Inc shares jumped 6.7 percent and Nvidia Corp rose 4.1 percent, helping drive the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index up nearly 8 percent. Intel shares were the biggest loser in the index.Swan will be tasked with getting Intel's manufacturing operations back on track and fending off newer chip rivals that are eating into Intel's dominance in personal computers and data centers.Intel intends to keep manufacturing its flagship CPU chips but remains open to using outsiders to make chips in newer markets like chips for cars or artificial intelligence, Swan told Reuters.""This is a capital-intensive industry, and we always have to evaluate whether it makes sense to have manufacturing for a given technology,"" Swan said. ""In the high-performance computing arena, we just believe we're the best in the world at it.""Given Swan's short tenure and lack of experience in manufacturing, many analysts believed he was unlikely to be named permanent CEO.Swan has also publicly said he was not interested in becoming the permanent Intel CEO. But sources familiar with the matter said Swan had privately said he would accept the role if offered.Swan has kept Intel's profit consistent with tight cost controls, analysts said. He helped Intel shares rebound after investors were spooked by a July disclosure that the company would miss the target date for its newest-generation chips, though the stock tracked the tech sector lower in the following months. But questions remain about Intel's ability to get its next generation of 10-nanonmeter chips to market by the end of this year in personal computers and early next year in data centers.""Swan is a rock-solid leader and financial manager,"" Chaim Siegel of Elazar Advisors said. ""My guess why the stock's down is investors may have been hoping for someone with more of an operations focus to get them through these (chip manufacturing) transitions.""In recent decades the chip industry has split between design and manufacturing, with manufacturing firms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co specializing in factories that make chips while firms like Qualcomm Inc specialize in designing chips but outsource manufacturing.Intel is one of the few remaining companies that both designs and manufactures chips. But it has lost its lead in making the world's smallest chip features to TSMC last year and is facing a growing threat from rivals like AMD and Nvidia that do not make their own chips.Swan will likely continue Intel's strategy of recent years to identify areas where it can expand beyond its core CPU chips, such as artificial intelligence chips, said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.""Bob will keep the ship afloat. The ship is going where it's going,"" Rasgon said. ""Hopefully there's no iceberg.""But Swan will face tough choices, like whether to keep focusing on businesses like memory and modem chips that connect phones to wireless data networks. Those businesses are much lower margin than Intel's CPU business, Rasgon said.Others who analysts saw as contenders, such as Murthy Renduchintala, Intel's chief engineering officer and a longtime Qualcomm executive, and Intel's data center chief Navin Shenoy, have been immersed in the details of the chip business for decades.Media reports had also said Intel's board was interested in Johny Srouji, the Apple Inc executive responsible for driving the increasing number of custom chips in Apple's devices.""People wanted a Microsoft kind of announcement, like (Satya) Nadella"" said Joel Kulina, a Wedbush trader in Toronto. Nadella led a resurgence at Microsoft that has it vying with Amazon.com Inc and Apple to be the world's largest technology company.""But what do we get? The CFO, because the CEO search produced nothing. ... Its bizarre for a company like Intel to have a leader who does not have a technical background. Hes a cost cutter.""Swan told Reuters his skills complement Intel's existing technologists, some poached from rivals such as AMD in recent years.""This company is extremely rich in technical talent, both on the design and architecture side and the process and manufacturing side,"" Swan said. ""My role, and my challenge, is how do we unleash that technical talent going forward to continue to do special things?""Swan had been in temporary charge of the chipmaker since last June when Brian Krzanich left after an investigation found he had a consensual relationship with an employee in breach of company policy. Swan will be the seventh CEO in Intel's 50-year history.Intel said Todd Underwood, vice president of finance, would become interim chief financial officer as the company undertakes an internal and external search for a permanent CFO.

82,2018-12-03T17:16:59-0500,"Microsoft has embraced open-source, partnered with competitors and scaled back first-party mobile ambitions under Satya Nadella.At market close on Friday Microsoft stole from Apple a coveted title: most valuable public company in the world.On Monday Apple recaptured the No. 1 position, although the difference between the companies is less than $17 billion.Over the weekend, a 2007 blog post entitled ""Microsoft is Dead"" from Paul Graham, co-founder of Silicon Valley start-up factory Y Combinator, was recirculated online. Graham argued that while Microsoft was still making money, no one was scared of it anymore.But on Friday Microsoft briefly reclaimed the crown as the world's most valuable publicly traded company, a position it hadn't held since 2002. At close on Monday, it had slipped into third place behind a resurgent Apple and rising Amazon, but all three companies are essentially battling it out for the top spot. Whatever Microsoft's precise position, it's certainly relevant again.Amid the renewed discussion of his blog post, including on Y Combinator's Hacker News discussion forum, Graham weighed in on Twitter. He said founders he's spoken with still aren't seeing Microsoft as the competition, but he also acknowledged that the company is in better shape now.tweetThere are several reasons for Microsoft's resurgence. And a lot of it can be traced back to early 2014, when the company replaced Steve Ballmer with the more soft-spoken Satya Nadella as CEO.Under Ballmer, Microsoft stock largely went sideways. But under Nadella, who took over in early 2014, Microsoft stock has moved up and to the right, consistently outperforming the S&amp;P 500. On Monday Microsoft stock was trading above $113 per share. It closed at $36.35 on the day Nadella became CEO.Here are several specific ways that Nadella's leadership has helped Microsoft get back on top.From Windows-first to Windows-and. The old Microsoft was obsessed with maintaining Windows at the center of all computing experiences, and that sometimes got in the way of what customers wanted.Under Nadella, Microsoft set aside Windows for smartphones and brought greater capabilities to mobile operating systems controlled by Apple and Google. Its engineers contribute considerably to open-source software projects, and the company regularly makes its own software available under open-source licenses. While it is still the Windows company, it has embraced open-source Linux, in the cloud, in Windows 10 and even in the realm of patent enforcement.Doubling down on cloud. With Nadella leading Microsoft has gone from being just another provider of public cloud resources to a real challenger to market leader Amazon Web Services.While Microsoft was active in the cloud under Ballmer, Nadella has made cloud a higher strategic priority and changed compensation for salespeople to ensure that customers ended up using Microsoft's cloud services.Nadella has drawn investors' attention to a metric Microsoft calls commercial cloud -- which includes the Azure cloud as well as business subscriptions to Office 365 productivity tools, commercial LinkedIn revenue and the Dynamics 365 business software -- by disclosing quarterly revenue for the category.And he has held steady on capital spending, which has made it possible for the company to open many data centers around the world.In an October note to clients, Griffin Securities analyst Jay Vleeschhouwer estimated that in Microsoft's 2019 fiscal year, Azure will produce $12.8 billion in revenue -- more than 10 percent of the revenue Vleeschhouwer expects from Microsoft as a whole for the fiscal year.More open to partnering. While AWS continues to compete with some customers, Microsoft has tried to make itself out to be less of a threat and more of a collaborative partner.At a Credit Suisse conference last week, Microsoft executive vice president Jason Zander was asked about what makes Microsoft's Azure cloud unique. Zander pointed to the breadth of Azure's portfolio and its ability to work alongside companies' existing on-premises data centers. He also talked about how Microsoft thinks about its own customers.""One of the key things I always tell potential customers and partners, we're not your competition,"" he said. ""We're here to help support you in a world where I think a lot of customers that I talk to -- they don't want to get technology on one hand from a provider and have that provider turn around and compete with them on another.""With Nadella at the helm, Microsoft has also been willing to put aside longstanding rivalries. It has formed partnerships with competitors like Dropbox, Red Hat, Salesforce and even Amazon.Less reliant on personal information. As some business executives and public officials talked about regulating big technology companies, Microsoft has largely been insulated from the strongest criticism.While Microsoft still has an online advertising business through its Bing search engine and MSN family of web sites, its core business is elsewhere. That means Microsoft has less obvious incentive to collect and store data about users.Facebook, by contrast, has seen its stock fall considerably this year after numerous questions and scandals related to how it uses and secures information about its uses.""I think that until Microsoft has been caught doing something really bad with data, they have a huge advantage,"" early Facebook and Google investor Roger McNamee said on CNBC earlier this year.Don Dodge, who spent five years at Microsoft in the 2000s as director of business development before joining Google, was one of a few people to publish blog posts challenging Graham's ""Microsoft is dead"" argument in 2007. And Microsoft certainly isn't dead in 2018, Dodge told CNBC.Dodge attributed the poor stock performance of the 2000s to two issues: the departure of Bill Gates and the fallout from the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft.""The internal restraint and caution was overwhelming,"" Dodge said.""The stock market started to take a new look at Microsoft after Steve Ballmer left the company,"" Dodge said. ""Satya Nadella really didn't change that much in terms of products, but he did change the perception. Azure is now the second-largest cloud provider, and will probably be No. 1 soon. That is simply moving traditional Microsoft customers from on-premise servers to Azure cloud servers, but the impact is huge both in terms of revenue and market cap.""WATCH: Roger McNamee on Satya Nadella: He has made Microsoft a trustworthy company"

""We will continue to monitor this very closely, and we can always consider additional measures if efforts slow down.""The EU has taken on a leading role regulating big technology companies.

85,2019-02-01T12:21:00-0500,"NEW YORK, Feb 1 (Reuters) - More than 500 news websites have made changes to their standards or disclosures after getting feedback from NewsGuard, a startup that created a credibility ratings system for news on the internet, the company told Reuters this week.The latest major news organization to work with the company is Britain's Daily Mail, according to NewsGuard, which upgraded what it calls its ""nutrition label"" rating on the paper's site to ""green"" on Thursday, indicating it ""generally maintains basic standards of accuracy and accountability.""A representative of the Daily Mail did not respond to several requests for comment.NewsGuard markets itself as an independent arbiter of credible news. It was launched last year by co-chief executives Steven Brill, a veteran U.S. journalist who founded Brill's Content and the American Lawyer, and Gordon Crovitz, a former publisher of News Corp's Wall Street Journal.NewsGuard joins a handful of other groups such as the Trust Project and the Journalism Trust Initiative which aim to help readers discern which sites are credible when many readers have trouble distinguishing fact from fiction.After facing anger over the rapid spread of false news in the past year or so, Facebook Inc and other tech companies also say they have recruited more human fact checkers to identify and sift out some types of inaccurate articles.These efforts were prompted at least in part by the 2016 U.S. presidential election, when Facebook and other social media sites were used to disseminate many false news stories.The company has been criticized by Breitbart News, a politically conservative site, which described NewsGuard as ""the establishment medias latest effort to blacklist alternative media sites.""The way NewsGuard works is this: red or green shield-shaped labels are visible in a web browser window when looking at a news website if a user downloads NewsGuard's software from the web. The software is free and works with the four leading browsers: Google's Chrome, Microsoft Corp's Edge, Mozilla's Firefox and Apple Inc's Safari.'CALL EVERYONE FOR COMMENT'NewsGuard's investors include the French advertising company Publicis Groupe SA and the non-profit Knight Foundation. Thomas Glocer, the former chief executive of Thomson Reuters, owns a smaller stake, according to NewsGuard's website. News sites do not pay the company for its service.The startup said it employs 35 journalists who have reviewed and published labels on about 2,200 sites based on nine journalistic criteria such as whether the site presents information responsibly, has a habit of correcting errors, or discloses its ownership and who is in charge of the content.News sites field questions if they choose to from NewsGuard journalists about its performance on the nine criteria.""We call everyone for comment which algorithms don't do,"" Brill said in an interview, highlighting the difference between NewsGuard's verification process with the computer code used by Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook in bringing new stories to the attention of users.Some news organizations have clarified their ownership, financial backers and identity of their editorial staff after interacting with the company, NewsGuard said.GateHouse Media, which publishes more than 140 local newspapers such as the Austin American-Statesman and Akron Beacon Journal, made changes to how it identifies sponsored content that may appear to be objective reporting but is actually advertising, after being contacted by NewsGuard.""We made our standards and practices more prominent and consistent across our digital 460 news brands across the country,"" said Jeff Moriarty, GateHouse's senior vice president of digital.Reuters News, which earned a green rating on all nine of NewsGuard's criteria, added the names and titles of its editorial leaders to the Reuters.com website after being contacted by NewsGuard, a Reuters spokesperson said.NewsGuard upgraded the Daily Mail's website rating on Thursday to green after giving it a red label in August, when it stated that the site ""repeatedly publishes false information and has been forced to pay damages in numerous high-profile cases.""The Daily Mail objected to that description, and started discussions with NewsGuard in January after the red label became visible for mobile users of Microsoft's Edge browser, NewsGuard said.NewsGuard has made public https://bit.ly/2sWV4km many details of its exchange with the Daily Mail on its website.""We're not in the business of trying to give people red marks,"" Brill said. ""The most common side effect of what we do is for news organizations to improve their journalistic practices."" (Reporting by Kenneth Li; editing by Bill Rigby)"

87,2019-02-03T23:54:07-0500,"Japanese tech giant Sony's portfolio ""is in trouble,"" said Ray Wang, principal analyst and founder at Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research.Wang's comments came on the back of Sony cutting its revenue outlook for the fiscal year. The company's stock responded to that news with a significant decline on Monday.Investors are closely watching the firm's gaming business. That division is the largest contributor to the company's operating income at more than 30 percent.Investors are running for cover after Sony delivered its latest results and guidance: Shares in the Japanese tech giant tumbled 8 percent in Monday trade.Underlying that one-day move is a concern that the company's portfolio ""is in trouble,"" according to one analyst.The company is in ""highly competitive areas with declining unit sales and margin,"" Ray Wang, principal analyst and founder at Silicon Valley-based Constellation Research, told CNBC over email.""They have a bad hand and need to change ... their portfolio,"" Wang said.Wang's comments came on the back of Sony cutting its sales and operating revenue forecast for the fiscal year. In particular, investors are closely watching the firm's gaming business. That division is the largest contributor to the company's operating income, comprising more than 30 percent in the first three quarters of Sony's fiscal year.The company sold 8.1 million units of its flagship PlayStation 4 (PS4) gaming console in the third quarter, according to its earnings release. That was lower than the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, but ""in-line with (the company's) expectations for this sixth year of the platform,"" Sony Chief Financial Officer Hiroki Totoki said at a Friday earnings briefing.Slowing sales of PS4 hardware and a negative impact from foreign exchange rates outweighed an increase in game software sales to drag down the segment's operating income as compared to the previous year, according to Totoki.Following the earnings release, Sony's shares took their big Monday drop.""Investors are disappointed with Sony's declining operating profits at its core gaming division,"" said Leo Sun, a tech and consumer goods specialist at The Motley Fool.Sun said the decline in PS4 hardware sales ""wasn't surprising"" given the age of the platform, but ""investors likely expected the PS4 Pro, PS4 Slim, and PS VR to give the hardware business a little more juice,"" in reference to the different variants of PS4 hardware and its peripheral virtual reality headset.""It was also disappointing compared to Microsoft's 9% year-over-year constant currency growth in gaming revenues in its latest quarter,"" he said. A constant currency calculation attempts to nullify the impacts of exchange rate fluctuations.Overall, Constellation Research's Wang said, Sony's content — including movies — remains ""the brightest spot"" and its cameras business ""is still growing.""But, he said, the company still needs ""a content, network, and tech strategy in order to create vertically integrated markets.""Nomura on Friday reduced its target price for Sony's shares but maintained its ""buy"" rating on the stock despite the tech giant's slash in forecasts.Some of that confidence stems from the company's efforts to strengthen and position its entertainment business, Nomura analyst Yu Okazaki said in a note.""We think growth opportunities around imaging technology are abundant in the electronics business. We also take a favorable view of the business platform strategy of supporting investment in growth fields with stable cash flows from consumer hardware,"" Okazaki added."
88,2019-02-03T22:25:46-0500,"The future could see Chinese and American apps and services dominate half of the internet each, leading to a split internet, according to Kaifu Lee, CEO of Sinovation Ventures.Commentators have dubbed this the ""splinternet.""Lee also said that China could be ahead of the U.S. in artificial intelligence in five years.Two internets could emerge in the next five years — one led by China and one led by the United States — a top venture capitalist has predicted, adding to a growing chorus of voices suggesting such a development could take place.The concept has been dubbed the ""splinternet,"" and it refers to a future in which the internet is fragmented, governed by separate regulations and run by different services. A unified definition is still unclear, but one suggestion is that the future could see Chinese and American apps and services each dominate half of the internet. That concept was the topic of much discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month.And while there may be two internets coming, ""it will not be China and the rest of the world. It will be China and countries that adopt Chinese apps, and countries that adopt American apps,"" Kaifu Lee, the CEO of China-based venture capital firm Sinovation Ventures, told CNBC at Davos.""While Chinese apps will have a hard time getting adopted in U.S. and Europe and English-speaking countries, I think they're proving their rapid acceptance in India, Southeast Asia, South America, Middle East and even a little bit in Africa. So I think in five years, if you look at all the people in the world that took their phone and counted how many Chinese apps and American apps, I'd say it would be fifty-fifty,"" added Lee, who prior to his current job was the head of China for Google.Indeed, companies like Alibaba and Tencent are already expanding their services abroad and acquiring or investing in companies across Asia. For example, Alibaba owns a majority stake in Southeast Asian e-commerce firm Lazada, while Tencent has an investment in Indonesian ride-hailing firm Go-Jek. Chinese technology giants are continually looking to spread their tentacles abroad.Lee is among a number of voices predicting that a so-called splinternet will come into being. Last year, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said he foresaw a ""bifurcation into a Chinese-led internet, and a non-Chinese internet led by America.""The United States and China are battling for dominance not just when it comes to the internet, but other, interrelated technologies including 5G and artificial intelligence.AI in particular is a technology that is seen as crucial to supporting future industries and one that will partly shape the way the internet looks in the future. AI is a broad term that encompasses the development of algorithms that are able to adapt and learn, which could boost the automation of many tasks. AI can be applied to many industries globally.A number of commentators have suggested the U.S. could be behind China in the AI race. That includes Fred Kempe, CEO of U.S. think tank the Atlantic Council, who said in a CNBC op-ed that ""China was on track to take the commanding heights of AI and that the consequences could be historic in nature.""Lee said that right now, the U.S. is stronger in AI research, while China is moving forward with the actual implementation of artificial intelligence technology. But that could change very soon.""It's (China) arguably ahead of U.S. in some areas behind in others, maybe neck and neck. But at the current trajectory, China will probably be ahead of U.S. in five years,"" Lee said.""China has more data, more users, more usage per data. And there's very pro-AI government policies. So these things cause China to be ahead in AI implementation, despite not being ahead in AI research,"" he added.The government of the world's second-largest economy emphasized the development of AI in its ""Made in China 2025"" plan — the country's official blueprint for dominating various areas of technology in the future. And in 2017, China laid out plans which it hopes will make it the world leader in AI by 2030.Both the U.S. and China have been aggressive in developing AI, and recent findings show a split between the U.S and China when it comes to patent filings. A study from the U.N. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) published last week found that American firms IBM and Microsoft are the two organizations in the world with the most AI-related patent filings. But among research groups and universities, Chinese organizations hold 17 of the top 20 spots in terms of total patent filings."

If Microsoft continues to gain against Apple, it will surpass its market cap for the first time since mid-2010. It briefly did so in early trading Tuesday.Apple and Amazon had been battling it out for the highest market capitalization, but the online retailer's stock has dropped in the tech swoon that began in October. Its market cap was $773.27 billion as of Tuesday's close.Mark Tepper, president and CEO of Strategic Wealth Partners, is backing Microsoft to overtake the world's largest company.""There are two industries that we're really bullish on right now: cloud and gaming. And Microsoft is a huge player in both,"" Tepper told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Tuesday.Gaming, especially, could be a game changer for the tech company, says Tepper.""I don't think everyone realizes how real this industry is. There's more people watching 'League of Legends' than the NBA Finals and the Olympics,"" Tepper said. ""To put that into perspective, the 'League of Legends' will sell out the Barclays Center for four-straight nights. The Nets can't do it for one night.""Tepper also faults Apple for failing to follow consumer trends and adapt its technology to suit.""I used to think of Apple when someone mentioned innovation but the problem is they've forgotten how to innovate,"" he said. ""Their MacBooks still don't have a touch screen option, and that's probably to prevent the cannibalization of iPad sales but, to be honest, who does any real work on an iPad? I think that's a huge miss.""Frank Cappelleri, chief market technician at Instinet, sees Apple soon restoring its solid lead. He says its charts look so bad they could be good.""Apple is down 26 percent from its high back in October. Annualized that comes out to 90 percent. We think that kind of pace is really unsustainable,"" Cappelleri said on ""Trading Nation"" on Tuesday. ""Apple is due for a near-term bounce here.""The last time Apple saw a similar move was when it dropped nearly 30 percent over the 12 months to February 2016, says Cappelleri. From those lows to its recent October record, its stock surged 150 percent.Cappelleri says Apple could soon bounce back up to its 200-day moving average at roughly $194. That represents an 11 percent rebound from Tuesday's close."

The two stocks could continue to go back and forth though analysts expect Microsoft to surpass Apple again and possibly trade as the largest company by market value for awhile. But don't count the iPhone maker completely out.Source: S&amp;P Dow Jones IndicesMicrosoft's recovery has been slow and steady. ""If you look back over the last four years, it's hard to sneeze at how well it's done ever since [CEO Satya] Nadella came in and changed the focus,"" said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. ""It was able to reinvent itself and successfully.""Apple was worth $826.8 billion Tuesday afternoon, while Microsoft was at $822.4 billion. On Wednesday afternoon, they were bout around $850 billion. Apple has been crushed recently by worries about iPhone sales and the tech sell-off, just months after it surpassed the $1 trillion mark.Ironically, when Microsoft was on top in December 1999, it was worth $604 billion, while Apple was a slender $16.5 billion, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices data. Microsoft was number one again in 2002, after the tech bubble burst but with a much smaller market value of $276.4 billion.Hickey said Microsoft isn't getting the credit it deserves. ""We've seen companies like IBM and GE that haven't been able to withstand changes in the overall business environment,"" he said. ""Microsoft is working on the whole subscription business ... and it's really getting in front of trends.""Apple has been the biggest company by market cap, since 2012, based on year-end data from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. Apple and Amazon had been battling it out for No. 1, but the online retailer's stock decline in the tech swoon has left its market cap at $773.27 billion as of Tuesday's close.Even if Microsoft surpasses Apple, the software company does not have the market sway of Apple, which has impacted sentiment and trades with the momentum names in tech. Apple has fallen 22.8 percent since Oct. 1, and Microsoft is down just 6.3 percent in that period.""Microsoft has just been slowly going on in the background there, and almost under people's radar. It's down but it's held up better than the market. It didn't get caught up in all the excitement we saw in a lot of other stocks,"" said Hickey. ""You look at both of them. They have identical dividend yields right now, 1.7 percent.""Hickey said it's really not unusual for a stock to fall out of favor, and now it's Apple's turn, something that it has experienced before.Watch: Steve Jobs explains the iPhone in 2007 CNBC interview""Maybe the only company that's reinvented itself better than Microsoft is Apple, but that was 15 years ago,"" he said. ""They've constantly been rivals to each other with each taking turns in the lead.""Apple's stock is now well below the average Wall Street target of $232, at $174.24, while Microsoft, $107.14 at Tuesday's close, was just about $20 below the average analyst's target.""Microsoft was an example of a company that was a monopoly and became too powerful. I think under this new leadership they figured it out. Whether they deserve to be larger than Apple, I don't know,"" said Jack Ablin, CIO at Cresset Wealth Advisors. ""One of the things about Microsoft, I don't think their customers are passionate about them. Their business and their brand is a serviceable utility, but as for Apple, people go out of their way to align themselves with Apple and that brand. That's impressive.""Still, the market has been rewarding Microsoft. Ablin said in reinventing itself Microsoft has finessed a recurring revenue model. ""Apple, for as great as it is, draws most of its revenue from one-time sales,"" he said.There is just a small group of 11 companies that have been number one, going back to 1925. AT&amp;T, as the former Ma Bell, held that title for 59 years, while IBM was at the top for 21, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones data. Exxon was the biggest company for several years in the mid-2000s.Stocks of the biggest companies typically also have the biggest market clout. Apple had been more than 4 percent of the S&amp;P when it was riding high this summer, but it is now at 3.6 percent to Microsoft's 3.4 percent.Source: Leuthold Group, Sept. 2018Leuthold Group looked at stocks of companies that were in what it calls the ""4 percent club,"" meaning those that had 4 percent. It noted the last time Microsoft was the largest company, it was at 4 percent of the market, as was General Electric and Cisco, in an unusual consolidation of power.""It's just so unique over the course of history. There are so few companies that have breached that mark,"" said Kristen Perleberg, portfolio manager at Leuthold. ""The bad part is they generally aren't able to stay there. Apple was just so unique in that they were able to come in and come out. ... In the past, it's been an ominous sign, but with Apple it's different.""Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, said the weight of Apple is small compared with IBM in its hey day, or AT&amp;T when it was 5.5 percent of the market in 1981. After the breakup of American Telephone and Telegraph, the new AT&amp;T slipped to fifth largest company in 1983, from number two in 1982 and number one in 1981.""Relatively [Apple and Microsoft] are the biggest,"" said Silverblatt. ""They don't wield as much power compared to the 6 percent IBM was at in the 1980s. ... They don't wield as much power as some other names did.""Silverblatt said the clout of the biggest stocks also spreads through the market because of the shares of suppliers and vendors connected to them.

""Now, Dell is a one-stop shop for nearly all your corporate information technology needs, [with] market leading positions in a host of product categories.

Additional pressure came from the International Monetary Fund slashing its global economic growth forecast for 2019 and 2020 and reports that signaled ongoing tensions between U.S. and Chinese trade officials.The IMF's forecast cut said a few things about the state of the world's economy, Cramer said. In her decision, the organization's Chair, Christine Lagarde, cited a slowdown in Europe. Beyond the obvious pressure from Brexit, that weakness could be tied to China because of how many European companies do business there, Cramer said.Either way, ""I figure the weakness in China will make it easier for President [Donald] Trump to get an advantageous trade deal,"" Cramer told investors.Click here for his full take.The stocks of a few top-notch Chinese companies may have already bottomed as a result of the U.S.-China trade dispute and could soon be buying opportunities for investors, a top chartist tells Cramer.Cramer, who has been steering investors away from Chinese stocks for the better part of the dispute, said he wouldn't blame anyone for thinking Chinese investments were too risky, especially after China's announcement on Monday.But when he checked in with technician Dan Fitzpatrick, the founder and president of StockMarketMentor.com and Cramer's colleague at RealMoney.com, he started to see things a little differently.""Fitzpatrick has a really interesting thesis: He thinks the current weakness is already priced into many of the largest, highest-profile Chinese stocks,"" Cramer said. ""Looking at the charts, he believes they've already bottomed [and] they're not going to take that bottom out, which means dips, like the one we had today, ... should be treated as buying opportunities.""Click here for the full recap of Fitzpatrick's analysis.Computer accessories maker Logitech International has had a pulse on the video gaming and esports space for years. These days, that pulse is becoming more of a drumbeat as esports gain traction, Logitech President and CEO Bracken Darrell tells Cramer.""If you're under the age of 25, you're so into gaming relative to any single regular sport,"" Darrell said in a Tuesday interview. ""Those people are now ... spectators of esports online, and, in fact, more people are watching people play esports online than are watching CNN, Netflix, ESPN or HBO combined.""No matter what, the rise of esports — fueled by mass competition games like Fortnite — isn't going away, Darrell said.""Fortnite's absolutely for real,"" the CEO said. ""We always believed that there would be game titles that would come in as this esports rise happened and explode, and for the first five, six years I was here, we didn't see that. We saw a steady, strong increase by League of Legends and Overwatch and the games that were already out there. But Fortnite's the first one to come in and really explode onto the scene.

Microsoft will support keys from well-known names Yubikey and the FEITIAN Biopass key, which retail for between $20 and $60. The keys are USB key fobs that users can insert into their USB-enabled devices.""Passwords are bad for the planet. They're bad for people. They're the easiest way for attackers to get in, and in the case of account takeovers, they're even a way to force people out,"" said Rob Lefferts, vice president of security at Microsoft.The average worker has well over 100 passwords to maintain, and the majority of data breaches that plague companies are the result of some kind of compromise to user passwords, according to several sources, including Microsoft and password security company LastPass.Microsoft has been advocating for the past several years for a ""passwordless future,"" one that increasingly seems plausible given similar moves by other tech companies to replace or substantially ease the burden of remembering so many nonsense words and special characters.Alphabet has a key-based offering that's been heavily promoted to power users via its Gmail service, but it still requires users to use passwords alongside the security key. Apple has supported several hardware solutions for accounts, including fingerprint access and facial recognition. All three of these big tech companies have supported built-in password managers and password generators that ease the burden of the huge number of passwords people have to manage.Microsoft has been one of the biggest advocates for total elimination of passwords, promoting biometric options as part of the Windows Hello service for Windows 10. Hello, which requires biometric readers such as facial recognition, supports access to machines running the Windows 10 operating system and has been adopted by around 70 percent of users who have the biometric hardware, Lefferts said. The company also offers Azure ID for businesses, which allows multifactor authentication such as geolocation and registered devices.The security keys used by all of these companies are supported by a tech consortium known as the FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance, which has for the past five years supported a variety of technologies meant to move people further away from having to rely on usernames and passwords. Members of the FIDO Alliance include diverse members of the tech, retail and banking industries, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Intel, J.P. Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs."

If they're right, we could all be in for some belt-tightening in the not-so-far-off future.However, there are certain spots around the country where residents feel the bite of economic downturns like the Great Recession less severely. Website Livability.com compiled a list of seven cities, largely in the Midwest and South, where you might consider relocating to avoid the worst effects of any recession to come. Here's a look at each, along with median home prices from Zillow.com and the local unemployment rate, based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data for December.Sources: Livability.com, Zillow.com, U.S. Bureau of Labor StatisticsMedian home price: $244,900Unemployment rate: 2.3 percentLivability reporter Emily Handy found that even during the Great Recession, Lincoln boasted an unemployment rate of no higher than 4.7 percent, compared rates as high as 10 percent in other parts of the country. How so? Jobs at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and in state government insulated many local workers, according to Handy, who also notes that the city never had a housing boom — so its housing market didn't have far to fall. This prairie city of almost 285,000 also tops Livability's list of up-and-coming tech hot spots, pointing to a bright future.Median home price: $169,700Unemployment rate: 3.4 percentWichita's unemployment rate of 3.4 percent is the lowest it's been since May 1999, according to Handy. Job growth this year is predicted to be both positive and steady, she added, and Wichita anticipates adding 2,700 new jobs. Kansas on the whole offers affordable real estate, and its residents enjoy the nation's third-lowest income-to-debt ratio. What's more, the cost of living in ""Doo-Dah,"" as the city is nicknamed, is almost 14 percent below the national average, according to Handy.Median home price: $244,945Unemployment rate: 2.3 percentNorth Dakota enjoyed an unemployment rate of 3.4 percent during the Great Recession, and now it's dipped to 2.3 percent. The Peace Garden State can rely on oil reserves and its agriculture industry to keep the job supply flowing, says Handy. And the best North Dakota city to live in during a recession? Fargo, home to firms like Microsoft and Case New Holland, generated $15.35 billion for the state economy in 2015, according to Livability, which awarded the city a spot on its 2018 Top 100 Best Places to Live list.Median home price: $188,250Unemployment rate: 3.6 percentHome to just 60,000 residents, Victoria is a hub of the Texas energy sector. Lying between Houston and Corpus Christi just 60 miles from the Gulf Coast, Victoria boasts a huge Caterpillar excavator plant and hosts Formosa Plastics Corp., polymer and fiber producer Invista, DuPont and many other employers that are constantly expanding and hiring, according to Handy.Median home price: $234,900Unemployment rate: 2.8 percentKnoxville's steady economic growth resulted in a No. 2 showing in CareerBliss.com's ""Happiest Cities to Work in Right Now"" list in 2013, and, more recently, a spot on Forbes' list for most Recession-Resistant Cities for Real Estate, according to Handy. In 2018, Livability awarded Knoxville the No. 8 spot on the Top 100 Best Places to Live list. Since there was never a housing explosion, there was never a crash, and currently home prices — now at a median of $234,900, according to Zillow — rise slowly and steadily.Median home price: $173,000Unemployment rate: 3 percentTulsa also didn't experience a housing boom prior to the Great Recession, so there was no bust, said Handy. Land in Oklahoma is inexpensive and plentiful, she added, and the state's agriculture and energy industries kept its economy afloat and mitigated the slump's impact. Tulsa even grew during the recession, opening its huge BOK Center arena in 2008 as part of its Vision 2025 project. Livability named Tulsa ""an underrated gem"" last year.Median home price: $139,000Unemployment rate: 2.4 percentAccording to a Pew Charitable Trusts study, Iowa's annual budget volatility is lower than average and has more in reserves than most other states. Handy found that during the Great Recession, Des Moines' unemployment rate increased by only 1.2 percent, while housing prices rose by just 0.1 percent. The fastest-growing city in the Midwest, according to Livability, Des Moines boasts a thriving start-up environment that made it one of the top cities for tech hires in 2018 and one of Livability's up-and-coming tech hot spots. Handy reported that Des Moines — nicknamed the ""Hartford (Connecticut) of the West"" thanks to its large insurance industry, is ""awash with job[s] ... in a wide array of industries, including agribusiness and financial services.""WATCH:Renting vs. buying a home — here are the numbers you need to decide"

But in recent months, the company has changed course, opting to work more closely with Facebook and contribute to the development of Facebook's own flavor of free AI software.Microsoft hasn't made a big deal about the change. But it reflects a willingness to back software that comes from other major technology companies, rather than focusing only on its own platforms.Google is the company behind the most popular open-source AI software, TensorFlow, which became available in late 2015. Microsoft put its Cognitive Toolkit, or CNTK, software on GitHub and gave it a more permissive open-source license in early 2016, and Facebook came out PyTorch, its answer to TensorFlow, later in 2016.The Microsoft system has strengths, particularly for building speech recognition systems, but PyTorch has gained adoption quickly and has some interesting technical features of its own, Microsoft's chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, told CNBC in an interview this week.Last year, Scott met with Facebook's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, and decided it would be good for the companies to attempt to ""defrag some of the complexity"" in the ecosystem of software that people can use to train AI models. In Sept. 2017 Facebook and Microsoft together introduced ONNX, a piece of open-source software for exporting models trained with one AI software framework, like Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit, so that they can be used to make predictions with other frameworks, like Facebook's PyTorch.""We have to be able to actually contribute back to the community,"" he said.tweetThe reality is there are just too many AI frameworks out there, said Sai Soundararaj, cofounder and CEO of AI start-up FloydHub. The start-up's cloud service has supported Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit, but it hasn't gotten much use from customers, Soundararaj said.Microsoft hasn't abandoned Cognitive Toolkit, even as it's focusing more on other projects. The Microsoft software still receives updates.But the direction is clear. ""The momentum of community, really, is around PyTorch and TensorFlow, and so that's where were throwing the bulk of our emphasis,"" said Eric Boyd, Microsoft's corporate vice president of AI platform. ""Having community adoption is hugely important.""The move around Cognitive Toolkit is part of a recent trend at Microsoft to embrace technology from outside the company. It has embraced Linux, making it accessible from within Windows 10 and creating a Linux version of its SQL Server database software. It has reduced its efforts around Windows for mobile devices and ramped up development of applications for Apple's iOS and Google's Android. And Microsoft stopped developing its own big-data software, Dryad, and threw its support around the Hadoop open-source tools.WATCH: Microsoft exec: Recognize the need for an A.I. ethics framework"

It's all part of Microsoft's shift to focus on the cloud and artificial intelligence under Ballmer's successor, Satya Nadella. Still, Windows is producing more and more revenue and a big chunk of profit, even as Nadella changes direction. ""I mean, this less importance on Windows thing I find a humorous thing by the press,"" Ballmer said in an interview on Monday at the WSJ Tech D.Live event in Laguna Beach, California. Ballmer said he can't imagine the company would do anything to unwind it. ""If they were, I'd be selling,"" he said. Windows revenue increased 5 percent to $19.5 billion in the latest fiscal year, which ended on June 30. That represents more than 17 percent of total revenue. Microsoft doesn't disclose operating income for Windows, but Ballmer said at the conference that the business accounts for $13 or $14 billion of operating profit. If true, that would represent about 40 percent of the total. While Ballmer said he doesn't agree with how some of the changes at the company have been portratyed, he's generally bullish on the direction. Microsoft has released several apps for Android and iOS, and has sought to bring more content from phones into Windows. ""The company has made a smart choice, in my opinion, to go more platform independent,"" Ballmer said. In working across operating systems, ""I think the company has done a good job,"" he said.Ballmer has certainly been rewarded for hanging onto his stock. Since Nadella took over the top job in 2014, the stock has tripled and the company is now worth over $800 billion. Ballmer's net worth is estimated at over $40 billion, and almost all of that is from his current ownership in Microsoft.""I'm glad we left the company with good profit streams and good technology,"" Ballmer said. ""I'm glad Satya's taken that to whole new levels. I think that's fantastic, and as a shareholder, I think it's double and triple fantastic.""WATCH: Ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer: The stock market 'feels a little bubbly'"
98,2019-02-02T16:02:36-0500,"Bezos admitted to changing his mind about ads during the company's all-hands staff meeting in November.Amazon bolstered ad spending by 72.5 percent in 2018, the biggest increase among the top 10 advertisers. The company bought up more than $1.8 billion worth of ads, according to Kantar Media.If it seems like you're seeing Amazon ads all over the place, there's a reason why: Jeff Bezos no longer hates them.Amazon's CEO once famously said ads are ""the price you pay when your product is unremarkable."" But during the company's internal all-hands meeting in November, an employee asked the CEO if he's had a ""change of heart"" on buying ads for Amazon's own products.""Yes, I changed my mind,"" Bezos said with a laugh during the meeting, a recording of which was shared with CNBC.The company's promotion of everything from its Echo devices to Amazon Web Services led to a 72.5 percent increase in U.S. ad spending last year to $1.8 billion, according to Kantar Media, which tracks TV, digital, outdoor billboards and other platforms, but not social media. That pushed Amazon into the fifth spot among U.S. advertisers and represented by far the biggest increase among the top 10 companies. Amazon didn't even make the top 20 until 2015.Bezos' about-face on advertising reflects the dramatic change in Amazon's business, which is no longer predominantly an e-commerce marketplace. While most of its revenue still comes from online sales, Amazon now has a whole portfolio of branded products and services that consumers and businesses need to see on TV ads and elsewhere. The four companies ahead of Amazon are Procter &amp; Gamble, AT&amp;T, Berkshire Hathaway (owner of brands including Geico, Kraft Heinz and Fruit of the Loom) and Comcast.During Sunday's Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and Los Angeles Rams, Amazon will be airing ads for the fourth straight year. Each 30-second spot costs a record $5.25 million this year, and Amazon is expected to run multiple ads during the game.Those costs are showing up on Amazon's financial results. In its most recent earnings statement this week, Amazon reported a record $13.8 billion marketing expense for 2018, up 37 percent from the prior year. That accounted for 5.9 percent of Amazon's total revenue, the highest ratio in 18 years. Within its marketing budget, ""advertising and other promotional costs,"" which includes referrals commissions, accounted for $8.2 billion, up from $6.3 billion in 2017, it said.Amazon disclosed in its regulatory filing that the growth in costs was primarily related to increased hiring of marketing and sales people, as well as more spending on ""online marketing channels.""Joe Swallen, chief research officer at Kantar, said that while Amazon is becoming more of a product company, it also has to invest more in defending its own turf because Walmart, Target and Best Buy are stepping up promotion of their online commerce businesses.""Even with its massive customer base and dominant share of online sales, Amazon needs to spend heavily on advertising to counteract the expanding focus of traditional retailers on e-commerce,"" he said.Much of that is going to television. According to Kantar, Amazon spent 37 percent, or $679 million, of its U.S. ad budget last year on TV ads, up from 32 percent in 2015.That's where Amazon can reach a wider audience, even if targeting and measurement is less sophisticated than on digital channels, said Harikesh Nair, a marketing professor at Stanford University.""TV still provides high reach, making it good for building awareness rapidly,"" Nair said.Promoting its brand to mainstream America is important because Amazon has expanded into so many different areas, including hardware, grocery stores and entertainment. Google, Microsoft, Walmart and Hulu are all competitors and require Amazon to broaden its spending, said Carl Mela, a marketing professor at Duke University.""To build share in these markets requires a substantial marketing investment,"" Mela said.Disclosure: Comcast is the parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC.WATCH: Amazon Echo is a key part of the company's future, says NYT columnist"

It's the latest retailer to choose against handing off its core computing needs to Amazon, which is both the dominant e-retailer and owner of the largest cloud-infrastructure business.Microsoft announced a big cloud deal with Walmart earlier this year, and Google has picked up business from retailers like Best Buy and Home Depot. Amazon's cloud does have retail customers, including Brooks Brothers and Under Armour.""What I hear from all these major retailers who are going through this transformation is they want to own their own data and they want a partner that is not going to be a competitor of theirs in any other part of their businesses,"" said Shelley Bransten, Microsoft's corporate vice president for global retail and consumer goods.In addition to Gap's use of the Azure public cloud, Gap employees will also receive access to Microsoft 365 services, which include Windows 10, the Office 365 productivity app bundle and the Enterprise Mobility and Security suite. Gap will use the Power BI business-intelligence software as well.Gap is looking to Azure for e-commerce operations, inventory and workforce systems, Bransten said. The size of the contract was not disclosed.Companies are moving to the cloud to take advantage of a wider array of real-time services than they can get from traditional data centers and to more efficiently spend their capital, which is of particular concern to older slow-growth businesses.Gap-branded stores generated less revenue than analysts expected in the company's fiscal second quarter, and the company's stock is down 18 percent this year.""Retailers don't have endless budgets,"" said Bransten, who spent more than 15 years at Gap and then worked at Salesforce before joining Microsoft in September.

The news was originally reported by ZDNet.While Cortana is embedded into the Windows 10 operating system and is available on smartphones, tablets and smart speakers, the assistant remains less popular than Apple's Siri and drives fewer specialty device sales than Amazon's Alexa or Alphabet's Google Assistant. But Soltero was a rising star inside Microsoft who was plucked up in Satya Nadella's first year as CEO.The departure was announced to employees this week, according to ZDNet. Soltero's last day will probably be in December, according to a person familiar with the move. It's not clear what he'll do next.Soltero tweeted about his departure after the ZDNet report.tweet""We are grateful for Javier's impact and strategic leadership over the last four years at Microsoft, and wish him well as he returns to his entrepreneurial roots,"" a Microsoft spokeswoman told CNBC in an email. ""Bringing together all of our work in natural language, intelligence and assistance -- including Cortana -- enables us to innovate faster for developers, partners and customers.""Soltero, a former VMware executive, got to Microsoft in 2014 when the company acquired email app start-up Acompli for $200 million, according to media reports at the time. In the next few months Soltero was involved in bringing a modern version of its Outlook email and calendar app to Android and iOS, while drawing on some features of the Acompli app, like its Focused Inbox that prioritized certain email messages.Outlook is a component of Office 365, the bundle of productivity apps for consumers and businesses. Business subscriptions to Office 365 represent part of Microsoft's Commercial Cloud lineup, which saw 47 percent revenue growth in the fiscal first quarter.The Outlook app has been well received on operating systems that aren't owned by Microsoft.tweetSoltero took charge of Cortana in March, ahead of a larger corporate shakeup. In August Microsoft and Amazon launched an integration of Cortana and Alexa.

101,2018-11-06T09:00:01-0500,"Microsoft's refreshed campus is scheduled to open in 2022, with 18 new buildings.Designers are using the game Minecraft to give employees an early peek of how it will look.Microsoft bought Minecraft parent Mojang in 2014 for $2.5 billion.Four years ago Tuesday, Microsoft closed its $2.5 billion acquisition of Mojang, developer of the video game Minecraft. It was Satya Nadella's first multibillion-dollar deal since taking over as CEO in February 2014.As it turns out, Minecraft had more to offer Microsoft than just a wildly popular game with 91 million monthly active users and 250 million downloads. The technology is now being used to help employees get acquainted with a refresh of Microsoft's sprawling campus in Redmond, Washington.Earlier this year, Microsoft enlisted Blockworks, a company that uses Minecraft's digital building blocks for designing real-world projects, to create a miniature rendering of the campus facelift, which is scheduled for completion in 2022. They're using graphics that are far more immersive than two-dimensional photos and videos.Microsoft's corporate headquarters occupies 500 acres of land and houses more than 100 buildings. Rather than setting up an entirely new campus (or two) like Amazon, or following Alphabet, Apple and Facebook in expanding into new areas, the software company is updating its existing one, tearing down old buildings and erecting new ones, while also adding cricket and soccer fields and room for retail businesses.tweetWhile Minecraft was designed for gamers, its immersive nature and the ability to quickly move around and construct edifices makes it easy to see how new buildings will look when inserted into an existing landscape. Microsoft recognized the potential of the game and introduced an education edition two years ago. It has racked up 35 million licensed users.""When you build in Minecraft, you build everything in the perspective of the player, constantly being aware of the sense of scale,"" said James Delaney, a managing director at Blockworks, which says on its website that it uses Minecraft ""to create experiences, communities and learning environments.""It's only natural that a kid was involved in the idea of using Minecraft to miniaturize the new campus.Riku Pentikainen, who until recently was director of global workplace strategies inside Microsoft's real estate and facilities group, saw his son playing Minecraft earlier this year and was intrigued by how the game could help the company with its transition. Employees could learn and get excited about the remodeling long before they could check it out on foot, and in a more dynamic way than what was available through typical renderings.Microsoft brought in architecture firm Gensler, along with Andrew Yang, a project manager, to work with internal staff, including Peter Zetterberg of Microsoft Studios, and Amy Stevenson, Microsoft's archives manager, who provided pieces of history about campus landmarks. They got approval from Phil Spencer, Microsoft's executive vice president for gaming, to use Minecraft for the project, Yang said.From there, the group issued a request for proposals, ultimately deciding on Blockworks, which had done work for Disney, Warner Bros. and the Museum of London, as well as Microsoft. The mandate for Blockworks was to have a virtual campus set up within a few weeks, in time for a Microsoft hackathon on July 27.A half-dozen people at Blockworks began constructing buildings off drawings from Gensler. Delaney said Minecraft forces designers to sacrifice some accuracy because structures in real life don't always have the game's squared-off look, but the speed and ease of use more than made up for those deficiencies. It might take just 10 minutes to wrap up a single building, he said.Minecraft also appeals to a broader audience of younger people, who might not know how to use computer-aided design, or CAD, programs, which require extensive training and aren't as collaborative.""Traditional CAD tools don't allow for that sense of awareness,"" said Delaney, who explored the use of Minecraft as a way to democratize architecture during his studies at the University of Cambridge.Microsoft employees — and anyone else with the education edition of Minecraft — can now take a digital tour of the new campus and see how plans are developing. Outside of Microsoft, that access requires a subscription to Office 365 Education.Yang said people are impressed with what they've seen, but improvements are coming. For example, he expects to add details like more realistic building interiors and additional people walking around the campus.""We're trying to be very, very selective in how we're going to do updates,"" Yang said. ""We want to make sure the next update is going to be meaningful and isn't going to be updated too quickly."""

But after hitting a 20-month low on Christmas Eve, the S&amp;P has gained over 9 percent.China has the ""good faith"" to work with the United States to resolve trade frictions, China's foreign ministry said, while U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he saw ""a very good chance that we will get a reasonable settlement"" as the two countries started their first face-to-face talks since a 90-day truce was agreed in December.""The main thing is the administration's implied progress on talks with China.

He highlighted three major considerations: privacy, cybersecurity and AI (artificial intelligence) ethics.""All of us will have to think about the digital experiences we create to really treat privacy as a human right,"" Nadella said.Nadella praised Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that sets stringent privacy standards for any company with business in the EU. Apple CEO Tim Cook also recently applauded the law, calling for similar federal privacy regulation in the U.S.""GDPR as a piece of legislation, a piece of regulation is a great start,"" Nadella said. ""We think about it as something that sets the standard, the bar, for how people need to think about privacy worldwide.""Tech CEOs like Nadella and Cook are getting increasingly vocal about their support for regulation amid ongoing data privacy concerns. In a speech in Brussels last week, Cook blasted tech companies saying personal information is being ""weaponized against us with military efficiency.""Nadella said common citizens and small businesses are most vulnerable to cyber threats.""We need to use our collective prowess and power to protect these most vulnerable of populations, and it requires not just our industry but also nation states to be part of that,"" he said.Nadella added companies need to develop ethical standards around AI. He said Microsoft and other technology creators have a responsibility to tackle the unexpected consequences of this new technology.""When you have some AI capability and it's trained for one purpose but used for another purpose, that's an unethical use of it,"" he said."

109,2018-10-24T15:32:36-0400,"Microsoft beat expectations on earnings and revenue.The company's revenue guidance was in line with estimates.The company's Azure growth rate fell.Microsoft  stock rose as much as 4 percent above the $102.32 closing price on Wednesday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal first quarter. Here are the key numbers:Earnings: $1.14 per share, excluding certain items, vs. $0.96 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.Revenue: $29.08 billion, vs. $27.90 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.The stock lost some of its post-earnings gain after Microsoft presented guidance for the fiscal second quarter. Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood told analysts on Wednesday's earnings call that the company expects $31.9 billion to $32.7 billion in revenue in the fiscal second quarter, including a contribution from GitHub, an acquisition that has not closed yet. Analysts had been expecting a total of $32.25 billion in revenue, according to Refinitiv.Microsoft's revenue rose 19 percent year over year overall in the fiscal first quarter, according to a statement. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had been modeling 13.7 percent growth -- just under the 14 percent growth Microsoft had across its entire 2018 fiscal year.Microsoft continues to emphasize the growth from its business-focused cloud services, which are tracked under the Commercial Cloud revenue metric. The company is challenging public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services with its Azure business, adding business users for its Office 365 cloud productivity app portfolio that competes with Alphabet's Google G Suite and seeking to take market share from Salesforce with its Dynamics 365 software.What's different now is that Microsoft is starting to include commercial LinkedIn revenue, which includes products like LinkedIn Recruiter, in the Commercial Cloud tally. In a presentation to investors last month, Microsoft showed how adding commercial LinkedIn to Commercial Cloud revenue for the 2018 fiscal year would bump up the total by about $3.4 billion, reflecting an increase approaching 15 percent.Commercial Cloud ultimately came in at $8.5 billion, up 47 percent year over year. Syed Talha Saleem, equity research associate at Credit Suisse, told CNBC in an email that he was expecting Commercial Cloud to hit $8.3 billion in revenue.Azure's revenue was up 76 percent, slipping from 89 percent growth one quarter ago. The Azure performance was in line with Microsoft's expectations, Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood said on a conference call with analysts after the earnings release.In recent days a few analysts indicated they were expecting an Azure growth slowdown. In a distributed to clients on Sunday Evercore ISI analysts led by Kirk Materne predicted 78 percent growth. Timothy Horan, senior analyst at Oppenheimer, attributed the slowdown to the law of large numbers. (Amazon's cloud business is growing more slowly, at 49 percent in the second quarter on a larger base of $6.11 billion in revenue.)""While this level of deceleration may seem overly cautious given the momentum behind Azure in the market, we believe it is instructive for investors to understand that much of this deceleration is due to the leveling off of growth for the company's Enterprise Mobility &amp; Security (EMS) products, which are seat based, vs. any major deceleration in the IaaS/PaaS offerings,"" the Evercore analysts wrote.Microsoft hasn't disclosed how much revenue Azure brings in, but the Evercore analysts estimated that it generated more $7.74 billion in the 2018 fiscal year. At that size, Azure would have accounted for 7 percent of Microsoft's total annual revenue.The company's biggest business segment, More Personal Computing -- which includes Windows, devices, gaming and search ads -- fetched $10.7 billion in revenue, up 15 percent. The segment came in above the FactSet consensus estimate of $10.18 billion.The Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, Dynamics and LinkedIn, did $9.8 billion in revenue, which was up 19 percent and ahead of the FactSet consensus estimate of $9.39 billion. The company had 32.5 million Office 365 consumer subscribers in the fiscal first quarter, up sequentially from 31.4 million.Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, containing server products and cloud services (including Azure) along with consulting and support, grew 24 percent with $8.6 billion in revenue. The results exceeded the $8.29 billion FactSet estimate. In the quarter Microsoft logged $4.3 billion in capital expenditures, up 59 percent year over year. Capital expenditures rose 33 percent in the 2018 fiscal year.""No customer wants to be dependent on a provider that sells them technology on one end and competes with them on the other,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the conference call.Microsoft's stock fell more than 5 percent ahead of the earnings release on Wednesday, in its worst day of trading since Oct. 10.

110,2019-02-01T02:04:00-0500,"* Estonia seeks to salvage reputation amid Danske probe* Financial supervisor warns of risks from online e-residents* Proposals to give police power to scrutinise crypto sectorTALLINN, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Estonias push to become a digital society has left it vulnerable to dirty money and sanction breaches, the countrys top banking regulator has warned.The Baltic state took centre stage in one of the largest-ever money laundering scandals last year - the Estonian branch of Danske Bank helped funnel money from Russia and other ex-Soviet states, a report by the Danish lender showed.Danske Bank is now being investigated in Denmark, Estonia, Britain and the United States over the 200 billion euros ($227 billion) of suspicious payments.The Danske debacle was rooted in old school subterfuge offshore shell companies were used to disguise where the money was coming from.But Estonias population of e-residents, some of whom bank in the country even though they live abroad, potentially offers a high-tech route for suspect funds.""The lesson of Danske is, I hope, enough for us, Kilvar Kessler, the head of Estonias financial watchdog, the Finantsinspektsioon, told Reuters. You onboarded customers which were offshore companies.""Now e-residents. Exactly the same questions will be asked. Who are they? Why do they need a bank account in Estonia?""A former Soviet-occupied state on the edge of Europe, Estonia has remodelled itself as a hub for digital innovation through 'e-Estonia', a government-sponsored project to move almost all bureaucratic tasks, from voting to medical prescriptions, online.A key part of e-Estonia is e-residents, foreigners who have been given a digital identity card allowing them to access some online services such as government portals. It can also be a stepping stone to banking in Estonia, a member of both the European Union and the euro zone currency bloc.Anyone can apply, including citizens of countries subject to U.S. sanctions such as Iran and North Korea.Banks including Estonia's largest locally-owned lender LHV , as well as Sweden's SEB Bank and Swedbank , allow e-residents to open accounts after they prove their identity and business links to Estonia.Kessler, who has the power to withdraw a lenders license to operate, has been cautioning bankers for some time that they need to thoroughly vet e-residents before signing them on.He has stepped up his warnings since the Danske scandal.Some 50,000-plus people hold the digital identity card but there is no public data on how many also bank in Estonia.Erki Kilu, the chief executive of LHV bank, said that while only a small number of e-residents opened a personal bank account in Estonia, the 6,000 companies registered in the country by e-residents required an account. One quarter of those bank with LHV, he told Reuters.Kilu said e-residents were subject to the same checks as other customers who lived abroad.In an email to Reuters, he said there were also ""later screening and monitoring processes"", declining to give further details. The bank does not open accounts for people or companies subject to sanctions.Ainar Leppanen, responsible for SEBs retail banking in Estonia, said it took a cautious approach to foreign customers without ""a clear link to the country"", applying additional measures such as ""background checks"".He said customers were checked against international sanctions lists and described the number of e-resident customers of SEB as ""insignificant"".A spokeswoman for Swedbank said it performed ""due diligence ... to ensure that their businesses have a clear connection to Estonia"" before taking on e-resident customers.Some banks, however, generally steer clear.We dont see a business case here right now, said Erkki Raasuke, chief executive of Luminor, one of the largest banks in the Baltics.The potential downside, if some of the anti-money laundering or sanctions-related risks would materialize, can be significant.""CRYPTOCURRENCIESCloser scrutiny of e-residents is part of a wider effort to curb financial crime by authorities in Estonia since the Danske scandal.In addition to the e-residency programme, the countrys digital pedigree -- video calling company Skype was built there and pro-business culture have made it an attractive outpost for companies working with cryptocurrencies.It typically takes just hours and an online form to open a business in Estonia and some 600 digital currency companies are registered there.""There is a money laundering risk with cryptocurrency operators. We have made it too easy for these crypto operators now. They get a reputational benefit from their link to Estonia. We get the reputational risk,"" Madis Muller, Estonias deputy central bank governor, told Reuters.Lawmakers are considering giving police the power to scrutinize cryptocurrency companies and withdraw their licenses if executives fail a fit and proper test of their reputation and ability to do the job.Under proposals before parliament, cryptocurrency companies will also be required to have a business presence in Estonia, something that many lack.""I understand that most would not be able to comply - and would not qualify to keep their license,"" said Muller.National elections in early March, however, could delay such reforms, as lawmakers would have to restart negotiations if they do not sign off the rules by February 21, when they disband.Estonias vision of an advanced digital society open to all is a point of pride for its 1.3 million people, many of whom remember the constraints of life under Soviet rule.Azerbaijan, which also declared its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, became the second country to launch an e-residency programme last year.As part of its digital branding, Estonia has gifted symbolic e-residencies to Microsoft founder Bill Gates, German chancellor Angela Merkel and Pope Francis, among others.""Digital is not 100 percent secure but it is more secure than analogue,"" Estonias president Kersti Kaljulaid told Reuters at the presidential castle, built by Russian Czar Peter I for his wife in the early 18th century. ""An e-resident bank client has passed a background check.""The Estonian police vet all applicants for e-residency, checking identity documents such as passports and examining international police records to ensure the applicant has not committed crimes overseas.The process typically takes between four and six weeks and does not require applicants to visit. Once issued, the cards can be collected at Estonian embassies.Roughly one third of e-residents come from Finland, Russia, Ukraine and Germany, according to official data that lists one e-resident in North Korea and roughly 400 in Iran. They are not named. Others come from dozens of countries around the globe from Britain to Panama.Madis Reimand, the head of Estonia's Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the arm of the police that monitors money laundering and crypto operators, said e-residents did not pose big risks although he said care should be taken in vetting them.But Reimand was critical of cryptocurrencies. ""We see really big threats from virtual currencies, especially threats of fraud and money laundering.""It is a far cry from 2017, when at the height of the cryptocurrency boom, the then manager of the e-residency scheme suggested Estonia to set up its own digital means of exchange, the estcoin.In the last weeks of 2018, the number of applications for e-residency slipped, according to official data.Although the scheme is growing year-on-year, at its current pace, it would take until 2488 to reach its original goal of 10 million people, something Estonia had set its sights on when the scheme was launched roughly four years ago.

111,2018-10-19T14:27:32-0400,"Microsoft paid $27 billion for LinkedIn in 2016 and is now tying its performance to executive pay.Almost one-third of Nadella's latest annual pay came from performance stock awards.LinkedIn will be one of six areas tracked, alongside metrics like the number of Windows 10 monthly active devices.Two years after Microsoft paid $27 billion for LinkedIn, its most expensive acquisition ever, the company is tying the professional networking site's performance to CEO Satya Nadella's compensation.Microsoft said in a regulatory filing earlier this week that activity on LinkedIn will be one factor in how much Nadella and four other top company executives, including Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood, get paid. It's the latest evidence that Microsoft considers LinkedIn a highly important asset as the company seeks new growth channels outside of its core software businesses.According to the filing, the ""number of times logged-in members visit LinkedIn, separated by 30 minutes of inactivity,"" on desktop and mobile devices will be evaluated over a three-year period to help determine the number of performance stock awards (PSAs) that get doled out to Nadella, Hood and the other executives — Jean-Philippe Courtois and Peggy Johnson, who are both executive vice presidents, and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith.Not included in that group are LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner or billionaire co-founder Reid Hoffman, who sits on Microsoft's board.Nadella earned $25.8 million for fiscal year 2018, from a combination of salary, bonus and stock awards. PSAs, one type of equity award, accounted for 32.5 percent of his total pay, and also represented a significant percentage of compensation to the other executives.While LinkedIn performance is already being tracked, the payout related to LinkedIn sessions won't be made until 2020 and will be based on three-year performance.LinkedIn sessions will determine 6 percent of total PSAs. That's still well behind the importance of commercial cloud revenue performance, which accounts for 34 percent, commercial cloud subscribers at 33 percent and two other metrics at 11 percent. But of the six metrics that make up PSAs, LinkedIn activity is the only new addition for 2018.Tying compensation to particular segments is about ""driving new growth areas,"" according to the filing.A Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email that company shareholders originally suggested incorporating a LinkedIn metric into compensation for the named executives. The board and senior leadership team discussed the idea, and it was approved by the compensation committee and then the entire board. Hoffman does not sit on the compensation committee.LinkedIn revenue more than doubled in fiscal 2018 to $5.3 billion — just under 5 percent of Microsoft's total revenue.

AIC said the storage period should instead remain at 90 days.The proposals would also compel tech firms to enable the ""tracing out of such originator of information"" when required by authorised government agencies.Internet freedom activists say this will weaken encryption and compromise user privacy as well as security.Mozilla, which runs an open source browser Wikimedia Foundation that hosts online encyclopaedia Wikipedia and coding website GitHub, urged the government to ""abandon"" the proposed rules.

116,2018-10-16T03:01:33-0400,"CNBC's Todd Haselton recently tested the Surface Laptop 2.It's thin, light, powerful, has a touch-screen display and more.If you're shopping for a new laptop, you need to check it out.Microsoft sent me its new Surface Laptop 2 for a test run. After using it for a couple days, I'm convinced that Microsoft can build a heck of a laptop and is more serious than ever about hardware.This is an Apple-level device with Windows 10, an operating system I've grown to love in recent years.The Surface Laptop 2 looks killer, especially in the black color I received to review. This model starts at $1,299 with 256GB of storage, while the silver computer is available for $999, though it only has half that amount of storage. Microsoft also sells the laptop in burgundy and blue.If you like MacBooks, you should take a look at the Surface Laptop 2. It's thin and light, just like you expect from a MacBook, but even beats Apple at some new features.For one, it has a touch-screen display.It's convenient to be able to reach out and tap an icon or switch an app through the touch screen. You can also buy a stylus and use the screen for marking up documents or fine-tuning a Photoshop image. I like that Microsoft still includes a more traditional USB port for keyboards, mice and other peripherals, instead of following Apple and forcing users to USB-C. There's no SD card slot, though, if that's important to you.Like Apple's MacBook Pros, the Surface Laptop 2 runs on Intel's latest eighth-generation chips. They're more powerful than the prior generation, at least on paper, but I didn't really notice much difference while working throughout the day in a web browser. Most things felt fast, and I was still able to use Photoshop to edit pictures. Without dedicated graphics, this isn't really a machine for hardcore gaming, so keep that in mind.Windows 10 has improved drastically, and you should give it a try if you haven't used a Windows device in a few years. You might be surprised at how good it's become. One feature I really like is called Windows Hello. Paired with the camera on the Surface Laptop 2, it can recognize my face and unlock the computer in a split second when I open the lid. Apple hasn't added Face ID to its laptops yet, but it seems likely to happen. I know some people probably don't like the idea of facial recognition, so you can still use a regular password or PIN if you prefer.The keyboard is excellent. That's important because Apple has faced a lot of complaints about its earlier MacBook Pro and MacBook butterfly keyboards. Some people have complained about the keys getting stuck. The keys on the Surface Laptop 2 have nice bounce, and I was able to type quickly almost immediately. There's also a good even backlighting across the surface. I'm a little worried about the Alcantara fabric that surrounds the keyboard, though, and I'm curious how it holds up over time. It looks like it could get greasy or worn down.The battery is pretty good, at least better than my standard-issue work laptop from Dell. That computer gets me a few hours of use, while the Surface Laptop 2 lasts most of the work day. I unplugged it in the morning around 8 a.m. and it still had 40 percent left when I checked it after lunch at 2 p.m. Your mileage will vary depending on the screen brightness and what you're doing, however.I've been critical of some of Microsoft's other computers, namely the Surface line, because it's hard for me to justify the cost of a tablet that doesn't include a keyboard. Conversely, the Laptop 2 has a keyboard and doesn't try to double as a tablet.Maybe that's why I don't see any real faults here — the Microsoft Surface Laptop 2 sets out to do one thing and does it very well. If you're in the market for a new laptop — especially one that runs Windows — you'd be silly not to consider the Surface Laptop 2.WATCH: The new wave in computing"

118,2019-01-29T08:31:00-0500,"(Adds share movement, background)Jan 29 (Reuters) - GameStop Corp, the world's largest video game and gaming console retailer, said it had abandoned efforts to sell itself after failing to get a potential buyer on favorable terms, sending shares down 21 percent in early trading.The company said it had held discussions with other firms, but did not get financing on terms that would be commercially acceptable to a prospective acquirer.Shares of the company surged 16 percent in September, when media reports said GameStop hired Perella Weinburg to explore a sale.Like most brick-and-mortar retailers, GameStop has suffered from heightened competition from online companies such as Amazon.com Inc. Game retailers have also had to cope with a decline in physical video game sales, although GameStop has partly weathered these declines by expanding into used video games and devices as well as digital products.GameStop sold its Spring Mobile business to Prime Communications LP for $700 million in November.The company's board is still looking for a permanent chief executive officer, it said.In May, CEO Michael Mauler stepped down from his post after only three months on the job, citing personal reasons. In June, the company brought on board former Microsoft Xbox executive and board director Shane Kim as interim CEO.

The Nasdaq Composite Index closed up 2.95 percent on Thursday, a day after closing down 4.43 percent.Following plummeting stocks across the sector on Wednesday, tech companies already started to see a lift after the bell when Microsoft and Tesla both reported estimate-beating earnings. Twitter reported positive earnings before the bell on Thursday, sending the stock soaring as high as 17 percent.Twitter beat revenue and earnings estimates despite purging a large chunk of suspected bot accounts earlier this year. While Twitter reported lower monthly active users, its daily active users have increased. Following Twitter's earnings release, Snap saw a lift over 3 percent in premarket trading and closed the day up 6.37 percent shortly before its own earnings release."
120,2019-01-31T09:41:41-0500,"Facebook's announcement that monthly users took off in Europe and Asia in the fourth quarter shows the company may not ultimately pay a substantial business cost commensurate with the public outcry over its privacy practices.The results could have bigger implications for other tech companies, including Amazon and Apple, which both have a stake in quantifying consumer privacy outrage in business terms.This week, Facebook pleased investors by reporting a strong quarter of earnings led by impressive statistics on user activity for the fourth quarter of 2018. In light of the social network's recent controversies, there were a few surprises in the figures: The number of monthly Facebook users was steady in the U.S., with spikes in the Asia-Pacific region. Perhaps most surprisingly, they also rose in the European Union — where the company has endured the brunt of criticism over privacy related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal and uncertainty over General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR.Facebook's success in courting users so quickly could have far-reaching impact, as other tech companies seek to understand the true consumer appetite for personal privacy.For Facebook, it means the wind will be at the company's back as it tries to merge its globally popular WhatsApp messenger service with Instagram and its core Facebook offering. The move, first reported by The New York Times last week and confirmed by CEO Mark Zuckerberg Wednesday, has already drawn the ire of the Irish Data Protection Commission, the agency that administers GDPR.The company has also recently hired one of its harshest critics to a privacy role at WhatsApp as it seeks to calm privacy concerns over the move.GDPR has been fueled in large part by public outrage over privacy issues at tech giants. In Facebook's third-quarter earnings call last October, the company blamed a downturn in active monthly users on the legislation. But the resurgence in European users going back to Facebook might show that the public outrage has been tempered by users' desire to return to the product.The data also calls into question whether privacy and security represent a business value proposition that actually interests customers.Apple has gone to great lengths to position itself as the tech world's privacy leader, while lobbing direct and indirect criticisms at Facebook, Google and Amazon over their own privacy practices. Apple has also weathered a handful of privacy scandals itself this week, including an alarming bug in Facetime and a report that iPhones were hacked for spying in the United Arab Emirates.Besides setting itself up for harsh criticism if a major privacy violation comes to light, Apple investors may be paying attention to Facebook's renewed success with users despite lots of privacy jabs from consumers and Apple itself. That includes an announcement Wednesday that Apple had disabled Facebook's developer access for internal testing of its app because Facebook was distributing to people outside of the company an app that sucked up incredible amounts of data from iPhones.While it's highly unlikely Apple would dial back any of its privacy features and pledges, it might scale down the messaging — including its recent spats with Facebook — if it appears consumers aren't responding.Google's parent company Alphabet has seemingly faced more issues related to internal dissension over privacy matters, including the controversial conversations the company has had with China on possibly building a censored search engine.The company also folded its Google+ product around the same time it announced a data leak in the social networking product, and the company is facing similar problems over its use of developer tools in the app store, though not as dire as Facebook. None of these seem to have put a meaningful dent in the popularity of Google products, but we'll know more when the company reports earnings on Monday.At the same time, Alphabet is also investing in products aimed at privacy-conscious consumers, like email-protecting key fobs and machine-learning features in Gmail that spot nation-state phishing campaigns. Security of personal communications, Google seems to be wagering, is still important even if big-picture privacy outrages don't move the needle much.Amazon, which announces earnings Thursday, has faced similarly harsh criticism to Facebook over its Rekognition facial recognition API and other technologies that some privacy watchdogs have deemed intrusive, including Alexa.Rekognition has been criticized because law enforcement agencies use it, and because developers can tweak Rekognition for their own purposes, with little centralized control over how its managed by Amazon or anyone else. Several privacy advocacy groups and other organizations, including rival Microsoft, have questioned the safety of the product and how it could be used for damaging purposes in the wrong hands.It's incredibly difficult for companies to calculate the business cost of ""social outcry,"" but Facebook did it Wednesday. And in its case, that cost may ultimately have been minimal. If Facebook's upward trajectory in terms of users and record profits continues, it will lead investors and companies to assume there's unlikely to be a linear relationship between what people complain about in terms of privacy and security and their likelihood of abandoning the product."

""It's been amazing to watch what they have done with technology, in the way that they've applied it to solving problems for their customers.""Microsoft and Grab declined to disclose the amount of the strategic investment. So far this year, Grab has already raised $2 billion from Toyota and institutional investors. It had raised about $6 billion in total funds as of Aug. 2, 2018, and is valued at $11 billion, according to CB Insights.On Friday, Reuters reported that Japan's SoftBank was closing in on a deal to invest about $500 million in Grab as part of the ride-hailing company's latest funding round that is likely to be completed in a few weeks.Grab President Ming Maa declined to comment on ongoing investment discussions, but he told CNBC that the company was on track to raise about $3 billion in funds by the end of the year. He also declined to give an estimate of how big the investment from Microsoft is, compared with the funds raised from other backers throughout the year.""We cannot comment on sizing but I think what's probably more important for us is not the sizing, but the quality of the partners,"" Maa said, explaining that Microsoft can help the 6-year-old start-up ""scale beyond where we currently are today.""Grab is already backed by a number of prominent companies, including SoftBank, Toyota and Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing.The company operates in eight countries around Southeast Asia. It offers ride-hailing, food delivery, mobile payments and financial services.

They all asked to remain unnamed because the price was confidential. A LinkedIn spokesperson declined to comment on the price.It's LinkedIn's biggest purchase as part of Microsoft, which acquired the professional networking company in 2016, and provides further evidence that Microsoft wants the site to operate independently. Through its subscription businesses, LinkedIn provides a growth market for Microsoft outside its core products like Windows and Office.With Glint, human resources staffers can survey employees and see how different groups of employees stack up. Glint users can receive alerts when certain teams aren't feeling so good about their work based on results, and managers can receive information in the tool that can help improve their organizations' future survey results.Microsoft announced its $26.2 billion LinkedIn acquisition in June 2016, the software company's largest deal ever.

World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) published on Thursday.The study found U.S. tech giant IBM had by far the biggest AI patent portfolio, with 8,920 patents, ahead of Microsoft with 5,930 and a group of mainly Japanese tech conglomerates.China accounted for 17 of the top 20 academic institutions involved in patenting AI and was particularly strong in the fast growing area of ""deep learning"" - a machine-learning technique that includes speech recognition systems.""The U.S. and China obviously have stolen a lead. They're out in front in this area, in terms of numbers of applications, and in scientific publications,"" WIPO Director-General Francis Gurry told a news conference.U.S. President Donald Trump has accused China of stealing American innovations and technology and has slapped trade tariffs on $234 billion of Chinese goods to punish Beijing.China said in December it resolutely opposed ""slanderous"" accusations from the United States and other allies criticising China for economic espionage and stealing intellectual property and company secrets.Gurry acknowledged there were accusations about China's behaviour but there was no doubt it had embraced the global intellectual property system, with the world's largest patent office and the largest number of domestic patent applications.""They are serious players in the field of intellectual property,"" he said.The WIPO study analysed international patent filings, scientific publications, litigation filings and acquisition activity, and found there had been as many patent applications for AI since 2013 as in the half century since the term was coined in the 1950s.Patent applications in machine learning, which includes techniques used by ride-sharing services to minimise detours, averaged annual growth of 28 percent between 2013 and 2016, the last year for which data is available, because of an 18-month period before confidential applications are publicly disclosed.Much of that growth came from deep learning, which overtook robotics as it ballooned from 118 patent applications in 2013 to 2,399 in 2016.The single most popular AI application was computer vision, used in self-driving cars, and mentioned in 49 percent of all AI-related patents.The study showed how technology had followed science, Gurry said, with the 2013 boom in technological applications coming 10 years after a similar surge in scientific publications.However, the world did not have any reliable way of measuring the quality of patent applications.""If you did, you wouldn't need a venture capital industry,"" he said.

127,2018-10-02T18:07:15-0400,"Microsoft unveiled a number of new Surface products on Tuesday.CNBC checked out the Surface Pro 6, Surface Laptop 2, Surface Headphones and Surface Studio 2.Microsoft announced several new products during a press conference in New York on Tuesday, including a new Surface Pro 6 tablet, the Surface Laptop 2, the Surface Studio 2 and Surface Headphones. I had a chance to check out each of them briefly, and here are some initial thoughts:I love Microsoft's Surface products, but on first impression the Surface Pro looks and feels a lot like last year's model. Under the hood, plenty has changed.  The device is 67 percent faster than its predecessor and can manage heat better — so it should be even more reliable. It felt quick, and hopefully the battery will last longer. I love the new black option. The $899 starting price doesn't include a keyboard, which still shocks me.Until I review one it's hard to recommend this over last year's model, which will probably drop drastically in price.I didn't review last year's model, so this feels pretty new to me. It's awfully nice, more premium than a MacBook Air, and includes a touch screen. Again, I dig the new black color, and I imagine a lot of folks are going to opt for that unless Microsoft only offers it a higher price. At $999, this is a laptop I'd consider buying. The keyboard feels nice, it's super thin and I love the bright and sharp display.The Surface Studio 2 is big, just like the original. I can see Microsoft's idea here: create a huge computer that has some of the same properties of the Surface Pro. You can push the screen up or pull it down and lean over it, giving you all sorts of new use cases that other all-in-one desktops don't offer. But at a starting price over $3,000, I think there's a limited market for it. These sounded silly at first, but then I checked them out. They're high quality (and should be at $350.) I love that each headphone cup rotates just like a Surface Dial. The one on the left can adjust noise cancellation on the fly — you can drown out the background noise or let it through — and the one on the right adjusts volume. The sound was, about what I experienced with my Bose QC 35 headphones, but with better noise cancellation controls. Also, it can access Cortana on a PC if you hold the surface of the right headphone for a couple of seconds or say, ""Hey Cortana."" I was in a loud room so that prompt didn't work, but holding the headphones did activate the voice assistant, and she accurately told me the local weather when I asked. "
128,2018-10-02T16:26:06-0400,"Microsoft announced a new Surface Pro convertible laptop at a press conference in New York City on Tuesday.There's also second-generation Surface Laptop and Surface Studio products. The Windows 10 October 2018 Update is available now.Microsoft announced several new Surface-brand devices, including a new Surface Pro 6 convertible laptop, during a press conference in New York City on Tuesday.The company also announced the availability of the next version of its Windows 10 operating system.The new Surface Pro 6 bears a striking resemblance to previous Surface Pro models. The latest one offers up to 16 GB of RAM and a solid-state drive with up to 1TB of storage. And this marks the first-ever quad-core processor in this type of laptop, Microsoft chief product officer Panos Panay said at the event.The Surface Pro 6 includes new Intel eighth-generation processors and are 67 percent more powerful than last year's model, Panay said, with up to 13.5 hours of battery life and an 8MP rear camera. The 12.3-inch device starts at $899.Unfortunately, as usual, that price still doesn't include the cost of a keyboard required to turn the tablet into a laptop, so expect to pay at least another $100 if you want full notebook functionality.The new computer comes more than a year after Microsoft announced the Surface Pro -- last year's laptop/computer hybrid. Following that launch, in the fall of last year, Microsoft announced the Surface Laptop, the Surface Studio and the Surface Book 2. In July, Microsoft announced a smaller, more affordable version of the Surface Pro computer, called the Surface Go.On Tuesday Microsoft also announced the Surface Laptop 2, which is a more traditional clamshell laptop with a touchscreen. The new product remains very similar to the original model that came out last year, offering the same 13.5-inch display, but it includes Intel's eighth-generation processors, which delivers an 85 percent performance boost -- along with a quieter keyboard. Microsoft says the battery on the Surface Laptop 2 will last up to 14.5 hours. This product starts at $999.Both the Surface Laptop 2 and the Surface Pro 6 will be available in a new color called matte black, not just the blue, burgundy and platinum options that were offered before. The insides of the devices will feature the ""alcantara"" fabric covering that Microsoft has previously used.Microsoft also pulled the cover off the Surface Studio 2 adjustable all-in-one desktop PC, the successor to the original Surface Studio that first launched in 2016. ""More of the high-end graphics you need, more of the brilliant screen,"" as Panay said. You'll be able to play Xbox games with wireless controllers on the device, whose display spans 28 inches. That size is the same as the original model, but Microsoft has bumped the sixth-generation Intel processors up to eighth-generation ones and is claiming a 50 percent boost in graphics performance, with help from Nvidia silicon. Microsoft is calling the Surface Studio 2 its fastest Surface ever.The new PC can be configured with a solid-state drive with up to 2TB of space, Panay said. Plus, the display is 38 percent brighter than the first model. This device will be expensive with a starting price of $3,499.Additionally, Microsoft is showing off an entirely new product, which it's calling Surface Headphones. They're over-the-ear wireless headphones that tap into Cortana, Microsoft's smart voice assistant. That means you can ask questions about the weather or the traffic to work, or you can ask Cortana to start playing music.There are eight beam-forming microphones that are meant to capture the clearest sound, for phone calls and voice commands. You turn a dial on one of the headphones to enable acoustic noise canceling. By turning the other headphone's dial, you can adjust the volume.These aren't the first voice-assistant headphones. Apple's AirPods are equipped with Siri, while Bose and other companies have shipped headphones with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa built-in. Microsoft said the new headphones will ship later this year for $349.Microsoft said in its Q4 2018 earnings report that Surface revenue increased 25 percent, largely driven by those products, explaining why the company continues to invest in its Surface portfolio of computers.On Tuesday Microsoft also introduced Surface All Access, a new way to pay for Surface devices, while also getting Office 365, support and benefits from the Microsoft Store. You can pay $24.99 per month for 24 months to buy the Surface Go and a Type Cover attachable keyboard, for example.Microsoft said it's starting to take orders for the Surface Pro 6, Surface Laptop 2 and Surface Studio 2 in ""select markets,"" with more availability later. The Surface Headphones will be available in the U.S. and the United Kingdom in time for the holidays.The Windows 10 October 2018 Update is available starting today. It includes a few nifty features, which early adopters, or as Microsoft calls them, insiders, have been able to try out in recent months ahead of this broader release. You can wait for Microsoft to inform you that the new version is ready for your computer through Windows Update, or you can hit Start and manually start installing the update by typing in ""Check for updates"" and click that option when it pops up. (If you're using a Windows 10 PC for work, ask your IT administrator when you can have the update.)Earlier this year Apple included a dark mode as part of the latest version of its desktop operating system, MacOS Mojave. Windows is getting its own spin on a dark theme with this new OS update. It appears in the File Explorer, along with things like the dialog boxes for saving and opening files. If you navigate to Settings &gt; Personalization, you'll be able to switch on this Windows-wide dark theme.A cloud-powered synced keyboard is also now part of Windows. You can see a history of what you've copied to your clipboard by hitting the keyboard shortcut Win-V. You can even pin things for faster access. And it will be available through all devices that have this new version of Windows.Microsoft is also making its SwiftKey virtual keyboard part of the core Windows touch keyboard When Microsoft first acquired SwiftKey in 2016, the technology was mainly about providing a better keyboard for Android and iOS devices. SwiftKey uses AI to try to predict the word you're trying to enter as you type or swipe. You can go to the Typing Insights part of Settings to see information about your typing in SwiftKey.And the Your Phone App lets you access text messages and photos on Android phones right from your Windows 10 PC.There are several other changes in Windows 10 October 2018 Update, and you can find a full rundown here."

Meanwhile, GitHub has 28 million developers, and Minecraft has 91 million monthly players.Microsoft has done more than 57 deals since Hood succeeded Peter Klein as finance chief in 2013, preceding the appointment of Satya Nadella as chief executive in 2014 — and some smaller ones have come with their own communities.Nadella's Microsoft has bought properties like email app start-up Acompli, storage company Avere Systems, AI start-ups Bonsai and Lobe, education start-up Flipgrid, and the Wunderlist to-do list app developer 6Wunderkinder.Lev-Ram asked Hood which acquisition she regrets not making, and Hood responded that she doesn't think like that.""That's not productive in my mind,"" she said. It's better, she said, to move forward and look for the next deal."

It hasn't updated that computer since. Also, about a year ago, Microsoft launched the Surface Book 2 and the Surface Laptop, two computers that could use an update to Intel's latest eighth-generation processors. Microsoft may also use its event to unveil a new version of its desktop computer, the Surface Studio, which was initially announced two years ago in October 2016.Microsoft Surface computers are becoming increasingly important. In August, the company said that Surface device revenues were up 25 percent, thanks to some of the devices that it launched earlier in the year.The timing is also important. Apple is expected to refresh several of its Mac computers this fall, potentially as soon as this month. A report from Bloomberg in August said Apple is planning a new cheaper MacBook Air with a Retina display and a new Mac Mini Pro.Correction: This story was revised to correct when the Surface Pro was launched.

Nordstrom Inc declined 8.7 percent, while Walmart Inc was off 1.5 percent.Technology stocks that had led the recent surge were also lower. Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp shed 0.8 percent, while Amazon.com Inc declined 0.8 percent.At 8:45 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 80 points, or 0.34 percent.

134,2018-10-02T12:34:13-0400,"Assuming that 2 percent of servers one day run on blockchain, Bank of America estimates the technology could be a $7 billion market.The firm identified nine companies that stand to benefit from eventual mainstream adoption of blockhcain, including Amazon, Microsoft and Oracle.""Amazon will benefit from incremental cloud services demand from Blockchain implementation, while improved supply chain tracking should make Amazon's retail operations more efficient,"" says Bank of America research analyst Kash Rangan.Blockchain adoption will eventually be a multi billion-dollar opportunity for tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft, according to new estimates from Bank of America.Based on the analysis, the entire total addressable market for blockchain will eventually hit $7 billion, though the analysts did not ""attempt to put a time stamp"" on it, as the technology is not yet widely adopted.The potential beneficiaries could marry blockchain with existing cloud computing operations and improve supply chain operations, according to Bank of America research analyst Kash Rangan.""Amazon will benefit from incremental cloud services demand from Blockchain implementation, while improved supply chain tracking should make Amazon's retail operations more efficient,"" Rangan said in a note to clients Tuesday. The estimates assume that 2 percent of servers will be used to run blockchain, at $5,500 per server, per year.Blockchain is a software protocol that underpins cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Also called distributed ledger technology, it shares data on a distributed, secure, and unalterable ledger in a way that ""databases have not been able to in the past,"" Rangan said. Walmart became one of the first retailers to provide a near-term use case, and said last week it would require lettuce suppliers to upload data about their foods to blockchain within a year.While it's not being used in many other consumer instances yet, blockchain could improve existing parts of ""software as a service"" or SaaS. Microsoft's Azure for example, could rely on what Rangan called ""blockchain as a service"" or ""BaaS,"" on its popular cloud computing platform.""BaaS on Azure offers services such as smart contracts and other third party apps, and should benefit as use of blockchain on Azure increases,"" Rangan said.Bank of America also said Oracle, IBM, Salesforce.com, VMware, and real estate and mortgage players like Redfin, Zillow, LendingTree stand to benefit from blockchain implementation.To be sure, Bank of America said there are a wide range of blockchain estimates out there, and its money-making ability is still unproven.""Many blockchain use cases have been identified, but full products/services have not yet been built out and are not used in production,"" Rangan said.WATCH: This is how blockchain can give 'invisible' people an ID"

137,2018-09-24T09:28:50-0400,"Microsoft, SAP and Adobe make the announcement at Microsoft's Ignite conference in Orlando, Florida.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella invited other companies and customers to join the initiative.There's no clear road map for the Open Data Initiative.Microsoft, SAP and Adobe on Monday announced that their companies are working together on a new initiative to help customers do more with their own data.The move comes as their customers increasingly adopt cloud software and infrastructure, which can make it more difficult to draw conclusions based on all the data stuck in various disparate systems.There's no clear road map for the Open Data Initiative, which was unveiled at the Microsoft's Ignite conference in Orlando, Florida. But initially the idea is to have multiple business applications using a common data model within Microsoft's Azure cloud, a Microsoft spokesman told CNBC. Microsoft's Dynamics 365, SAP's C/4HANA and Adobe's Experience Cloud will be among the first compatible services, the spokesman said.""You have these very sophisticated, rich application suites from SAP, from Adobe, from Microsoft. And the commitment you're hearing from the three of us is that we're going to unlock the data across all of these suites,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said during the announcement. ""There is no data silos. Think of all data as a continuous renewable resource.""Nadella said that with by operating in Azure as part of the new effort, applications can benefit from the use of additional technologies, including artificial intelligence. Microsoft provides cloud tools for image recognition, speech recognition and text translation, among other things.Nadella invited other companies and customers to join the initiative, calling the partnership an ""open framework"" for others to build upon. It's not clear if Microsoft's competitors in the cloud, including Amazon and Salesforce, will get involved.Coca-Cola, Unilever and Walmart are supportive of the initiative, the spokesman said."
138,2018-09-24T09:00:03-0400,"The Azure Data Box Edge launch comes a year after Microsoft introduced the original Azure Data Box for migrating data to the cloud.The next hardware carries the same type of programmable chips that Microsoft uses in its own cloud servers.Microsoft on Monday unveiled new hardware that businesses can use in factories and other sites and is designed to efficiently run artificial intelligence computations without requiring customers to install special processors.The introduction of the Azure Data Box Edge comes as Microsoft seeks to gain share from public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services and fend off smaller challengers like Google.Amazon pioneered the idea of blending special-purpose hardware with its cloud services in a product called Snowball. With Snowball, Amazon sends highly durable hardware to customers. They fill up the boxes' hard drives with data, then mail them back for long-term storage in cloud data centers.Amazon introduced Snowball in 2015. The company has since come out with a large-scale version of the Snowball in the form of a truck. It also made it possible for companies to run certain kinds of computations inside Snowballs.Microsoft came out with its own version of Snowball, called the Azure Data Box, with room for 100 terabytes of data, a year ago.Now it's coming out with a variant that's tailor-made for AI.""What we want to be able to do is give people a handful of choices of our custom IP [intellectual property]. We've got things we've proved out in production environments that work really well,"" Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Kevin Scott told CNBC.Scott said having this technology available to go to a whole range of places means that customers can comply with regulations, avoid issues when networks fail and receive better performance than what they would get if they were relying exclusively on heavy-duty data crunching in a cloud.Generally speaking, with a trendy type of AI known as deep learning, people train models using large amounts of data, like photos, and then let the models make inferences about new data based on what the models have learned. The chip in the Azure Data Box Edge can handle the inference stage; training can happen elsewhere.In July, Google announced an initiative around AI processors for internet-connected devices that could be placed in a wide range of locations, including factories. Those processors are also intended for inference work. But they're not widely available yet.Google's chips are designed in house. Microsoft's, by contrast, are field-programmable gate arrays, which can be bought and then adjusted to deliver high performance for specific types of computing jobs. Microsoft has previously installed these FPGAs in its own servers, for Azure as well as its Bing search engine. Microsoft has gotten partners Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise to come up with servers containing these chips as well.The new Microsoft-branded boxes work with the company's open-source software, which makes it possible for third-party software developers to build customizations, Microsoft corporate vice president Julia White said.One early customer of the Azure Data Box Edge, Cree, is using it on a factory floor to process quality control photos for its manufacturing process, White said.During the preview period for the boxes, Microsoft is working with customers to offer boxes with FPGAs, as well as similar devices that carry more traditional computer chips instead, White said.Microsoft will announce the cost of the new hardware before the end of the year."
139,2019-01-30T10:00:51-0500,"Ironclad has almost 70 employees, with about 20 percent having previously worked at Palantir.It just raised $23 million in a round led by Sequoia.Customers include Dropbox and Autodesk.When Jason Boehmig was in law school at Notre Dame in 2012, he decided he really wanted to be in technology. So he sent a cold email to Ted Wang, who was one of Silicon Valley's most prominent lawyers, having represented Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, Square and Spotify.Boehmig asked Wang for a 15-minute meeting to pitch him on his idea to bring intelligent software to the legal world. Wang agreed to hear him out, so Boehmig hopped on a plane from Indiana to meet with the lawyer in the Bay Area.""Wouldn't it be great if you could have associates who could code and automate their own jobs and would make the firm more efficient?"" Boehmig recalled asking Wang, who was a partner at Fenwick &amp; West. Wang liked the idea enough that he ended up hiring Boehmig for a two-year gig helping out on start-up work.""He came and helped us deliver a higher-quality service to our clients,"" said Wang. ""So we could make their experience better, the work product was more accurate, and it was cheaper to the client.""Seven years later, Boehmig and Wang are still working together on that idea.Boehmig is co-founder and CEO of Ironclad, a start-up focused on automating the flow of contracts and other paperwork. Wang, who joined investment firm Cowboy Ventures in 2017, put some money into the company.Ironclad has since caught the attention of the best-known start-up investors. The company said Wednesday that it's just closed a $23 million financing round, led by Sequoia Capital.The fresh money is ""really around intelligence as the future of our software,"" Boehmig said in an interview.Lawyers generally have to do a bunch of things before a contract is complete. They have to prepare the right first draft. Then they have to track the changes in versions as different parties contribute. Then they have to get the right signatures. Finally, they have to store the document so it can be easily discovered.Ironclad is trying to simplify the process, so that law firms and legal teams can save time and money. The company now has more than 100 customers, including Autodesk, Dropbox, Glassdoor and L'Oreal.""Instead of having 10 forms lying around, you have a simple flow,"" said Dan Cook, Dropbox's vice president of legal. ""It's a simple interface that does what you expect it to.""In the past 12 to 14 months, Ironclad has run as many as 1,700 transactions for Dropbox, Cook said. Each transaction entails establishing a new document, getting it approved and then storing it properly. The remainder of the cases involves a manual ticketing system that assigns work to an attorney or contracts manager, who can approve documents and amend as needed.The software works with e-signature tools like Adobe Sign, DocuSign and HelloSign, which was just acquired by Dropbox. It can also save files to cloud storage services Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive.Boehmig, who taught himself to code, started developing products while at Fenwick that would automatically incorporate a company or generate a term sheet for the mergers and acquisitions department.After leaving Fenwick, Boehmig attended a lecture at Stanford's law school, where he met Cai GoGwilt, a former software developer at Palantir. They were both interested in building software for legal contracts, so they started working together and then applied for the Y Combinator accelerator program.About 20 percent of Ironclad's nearly 70 employees previously worked at Palantir, the secretive data analytics start-up that does work for numerous government agencies.But Ironclad isn't modeling itself on Palantir, which provides services as well as software.""We very much want to be a product company from the beginning, with everyone on the exact same platform and the exact same stack,"" Boehmig said.In addition to automating contracts for things like sales deals, Ironclad can be more general purpose, producing and managing the flow of offer letters, for example. It also has a healthy dose of legal expertise on the team, including Chris Young, who was previously general counsel at GoFundMe, and Damon Mino, who was head of the legal business at DocuSign.With Ironclad's software working on a wider array of products, the company's collection of data grows, allowing its developers to build more sophistication into the service. The system could cut down on unnecessary back-and-forth in communication and come up with clearer ways of conveying information in a contract.Senior partners at a law firm can run $1,000 per hour, said GoGwilt, the company's chief technology officer. Ironclad isn't trying to displace lawyers, but it can at least help companies cut the cost of its bills.""Ironclad has seen more indemnification provisions than any senior partner at a law firm and will continue to see more of those,"" GoGwilt said.Jess Lee of Sequoia has typically invested in consumer technology. But after meeting Boehmig and hearing more about the product, she immediately understood its value. Lee was previously CEO of e-commerce site Polyvore, where she had to deal with all sorts of signed agreements.""As he explained the product, I was just thinking, 'Oh my God, I could have used this,'"" she said.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.Update: After publication of the story, Sequoia clarified that the amount of the financing was $23 million."

The next big companies to go are General Electric and Amazon whose results are due on Thursday.The Fed is scheduled to release its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. ET, with investors widely expecting it to leave its benchmark overnight lending rate unchanged but possibly acknowledge its intention to remain patient on further rate hikes this year. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is due to hold a press conference shortly after the statement's release at 2:30 p.m.There are three things that Fed watchers want to hear from the chief — flexibility on the balance sheet policy, ""patience and flexibility"" and attention to data and the markets.Powell had already said the balance sheet would be ""substantially smaller"" than it is now, but he had another run in with markets when he said in early October that the Fed was far from a neutral rate. Fed officials including New York Fed President John Williams have recently stressed that they are watching economic reports and will go slow when it comes to raising rates.The United States and China finally commenced their trade war negotiations on Wednesday, trying to work up a long-term deal before the tariff cease-fire expires Mar. 2.Chinese representatives are due to meet with a group of White House officials Wednesday and Thursday for the talks. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will lead the discussions.Optimism towards a resolution is growing as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday the U.S. expects to make ""significant progress"" in trade talks this week. Top White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow also said President Donald Trump is ""moderately optimistic"" about reaching a deal.Even Apple CEO Tim Cook is seeing ""more optimism in the air in January"" about the trade tensions.The month ends on Thursday and so far the S&amp;P 500 is up 5 percent and counting in January.

141,2019-01-31T11:07:00-0500,"MUMBAI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - An Asian internet lobby group, whose members include Alphabet's Google and Facebook , on Thursday criticised India's plans to regulate social media content.The proposal drafted by India's technology ministry in December would compel Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter to remove within 24 hours content deemed to be unlawful, including anything affecting the ""sovereignty and integrity of India"".Tech giants are preparing to fight the changes in the ""intermediary guidelines"", Reuters has reported.""While Internet intermediaries fully support addressing issues like malicious misinformation, we strongly feel that blanket regulation that is overly broad and contains vague and ambiguous language will jeopardise citizens' fundamental rights to privacy and free speech,"" Jeff Paine, Managing Director of the Asia Internet Coalition (AIC), said in a statement.The AIC has also voiced its concerns in a letter responding to an invitation by India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology for public comments and suggestions on the draft rules by January 31.""In addition to interfering with the fundamental rights of freedom of speech and expression, and right to privacy ... the Draft Rules impose burdensome obligations on the intermediaries,"" the AIC said in the letter.The draft rules come ahead of India's general election which is due by May and amid a rise in so-called fake news, which has been blamed for mob beatings and killings.India's two main parties accuse each other of spreading fake news, which could sway votes, while denying they do so themselves.The 24-hour time limit does not allow intermediaries to analyse the request for taking down content or take legal recourse, the AIC said, adding that it also raises challenges for firms which have few employees working during daytime.The draft rules would require social media firms to preserve such information and any related records for 180 days. AIC said the storage period should instead remain at 90 days.The proposals would also compel tech firms to enable the ""tracing out of such originator of information"" when required by authorised government agencies.Internet freedom activists say this will weaken encryption and compromise user privacy as well as security.Mozilla, which runs open source browser Wikimedia Foundation that hosts online encyclopaedia Wikipedia and coding website GitHub urged the government to ""abandon"" the proposed rules.

Amazon, Google and other companies are also making strides in these two areas.Microsoft introduced Dynamics 365 AI for Customer Service and Dynamics 365 AI for Market Insights at an event in San Francisco. The former will highlight existing and emerging issues that agents face and help with the deployment of chatbots that can handle inquiries. The latter is meant to help marketers see what people are talking about on channels like social networks.Earlier this year Microsoft introduced Dynamics 365 AI for Sales, which can provide deliver insights about individual salespeople and deals logged in Microsoft's Dynamics 365 sales relationship-tracking service. It can even display information about sales opportunities reported in Salesforce's Sales Cloud tool, or comparable systems from Oracle and SAP.Salesforce's Einstein add-on provides its own suggestions based on information in Sales Cloud, and Einstein enhancements are also available for Salesforce's marketing and customer-service products. Microsoft's AI tools for marketing, customer service and sales will become available to customers in preview this fall.Last year, Microsoft talked about how it worked closely with a handful of customers, like HP and Macy's, to build sophisticated domain-specific customer-service technology. Every PC that HP shipped even came with the resulting chatbot as part of HP's Support Assistant software.But Microsoft won't be doing these sorts of high-touch AI engagements with customers for the foreseeable future, says Alysa Taylor, corporate vice president for business applications and global industry.""When we think about those multi-year big contracts, when you're in-house servicing, we do that through partnerships with global ... as well as national and local system integrators,"" Taylor told CNBC in an interview.Put another way, Microsoft will leave these big projects to its army of partners.Microsoft effectively started and nurtured the program in its research group and turned it over this summer to Taylor's group, which developed a packaged-up product that's easier for customers to start using on their own. ""We don't have enough engineers in our research team to serve every organization on the planet,"" she said.""That was the design plan from day one,"" Taylor said.Last year Microsoft added a reference to AI to its corporate vision. At this point, Microsoft is looking to help every company become AI-first, Taylor said."

The software is available for free users of the service as well as paying corporate customers.Microsoft and Salesforce have long competed in the market for customer relationship management software and also have rival products for internal chat. The companies partner in various ways, but the relationship has become strained since Microsoft outbid Salesforce for LinkedIn in 2016. The introduction of Quip Slides is another sign that Salesforce is going more directly at the Office suite of productivity tools, a key part of Microsoft's business. It's also an alternative to Google Slides, which is part of Alphabet's growing cloud business.""It's our goal with Quip to help nearly every person at nearly every company in the world to get their work done,"" Kevin Gibbs, co-founder and CEO of Quip, said in an interview. Gibbs took the helm at Quip last year, when its previous CEO, Bret Taylor, was elevated to the position of Salesforce's chief product officer.Salesforce acquired Quip in 2016 for $582 million.The company started working on the new product a year and a half ago in response to customer feedback, Gibbs said. Quip Slides lets users respond to surveys within presentations, have conversations and view charts of current data from Salesforce's Sales Cloud tool and Quip's spreadsheets. Folders of files stored in Box and Dropbox can be embedded in slides, and users can collaborate as they make new decks in Quip slides.Gibbs said Quip doesn't have plans to introduce email or voice-calling services, which are available from Google and Microsoft's productivity bundles. He said that Quip is still a small part of Salesforce and that ""it's still early"" for the group.

Last week, although it confirmed the outage, it declined to give details.The Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond immediately to a faxed request from Reuters seeking comment.Starting from Thursday, Internet users in China attempting to access cn.bing.com, the search engine's domestic URL, found themselves directed to an error page.Attempts to log on to Facebook, Google search, or other sites blocked by China's Great Firewall, encountered the same fate.Service had resumed by late on Friday, however.Engineers at ExpressVPN, a provider of virtual private network (VPN) software allowing internet users in China to access censored websites, ran tests during the outage to determine its origin.They found that rather than domain name service (DNS) poisoning, the most common means for blocking sites under the Great Firewall, Bing's outage appeared to employ a technique known as ""black-holing"".With this method, rather than re-directing to a dummy server traffic headed for a specific website, the traffic is simply cut off en route, usually at the internet service provider (ISP) level.Express VPN Vice President Harold Li said blackholing boosts the likelihood of an accidental block, versus the more typical DNS poisoning, though he added that the company could not confirm the exact nature of the outage.""We have no idea if it was an accident or not, but it's much easier to make the mistake of blocking Bing when you're blocking a set of IP addresses,"" he said, referring to website addresses.Bing has long been the only major overseas search engine accessible in China, which blocked access to Alphabet's Google search platform starting in 2010. Microsoft alters Bing's results to avoid politically sensitive topics, in line with government policy.Bing's outage came a day after a widely read article by a Chinese journalist criticizing the quality of search results from Baidu, the dominant domestic search engine.That led some internet users to speculate the two incidents were related. The company has endured regular public backlash since 2016, when a Chinese student died after seeking treatment at a hospital that advertised on Baidu."

Revenue from the new segment, launched in 2017, has already surpassed that of Adobe's document cloud.Narayen said Adobe and Microsoft make such effective partners because Microsoft's cloud platform Azure enables businesses to ""process the data at the pace they want"" and Adobe's enterprise solutions allow businesses to ""attract customers to the platform and engage it.""""We continue to think content and data and how content and data come together is really how this magic happens. ...

Both companies pointed to weakness in China, feeding fears of a global slowdown.""We're not making big bets for or against stocks and bonds. We're trying to see if this is a garden variety slowdown or if it's the beginning of something worse. I don't think any of us knows the answer to that now,"" said Ed Keon, portfolio manager and chief investment strategist at QMA.Some technical strategists who say the S&amp;P 500 could fall further, see a drop of 5 percent as a possibility with the S&amp;P dipping to a support level of around 2,500. But some analysts, like Keon, say more than declining, it would not be surprising if the market becomes locked in a sideways move for awhile.For the month of January, the S&amp;P 500 was up 5.2 percent as of Monday and up 12.2 percent since the Dec. 24 closing low. The S&amp;P 500 was trading just under 2,640 Monday afternoon, a decline of 1 percent. Stocks were selling off Monday on the eve of a Fed meeting where the Fed is not expected to take any action on interest rates but is expected to sound very wiling to pause its rate hiking.""Tactically, February does sport a mixed performance reputation and may be a catalyst for a pause or consolidation after a +15% rally. There's been some modest loss of momentum over recent days, but we'd look to the 2500/2550 area to offer support and contain weakness moving forward,"" Strategas analysts wrote in a note. On average, the S&amp;P 500 has been flat in February, going back to 1950, according to Strategas data.Ari Wald, technical strategist at Oppenheimer, said he believes the market is in a consolidating phase, after its big run higher from the December low. He said stocks could test lower levels, but he is not looking for a return to the December low of 2,346.""A higher low makes more sense to us,"" said Wald, noting the S&amp;P could retest back to 2,500.""Just in terms of near term support level, I don't think today's drop is necessarily meaningful in terms of falling below any important support levels. The level I'm watching on the downside is 2,600.""That level was the Oct. 29 low, and another important level in December. ""When we really started to drop again, the market really started to cascade on that initial breach of 2,600,"" Wald said.U.S.-China trade talks, which resume this week at a high level are seen as a possible catalyst for the market.""This week and next week, we have the Fed, trade talks and earnings. For the very near term, trade is probably going to be the biggest driving force for what the market does,"" said Dan Suzuki, portfolio manager at Richard Bernstein Advisors. Suzuki said he optimistic for a deal. ""If you look at the way Trump negotiates, it's going to go to the 11th hour, and it's going to feel like there' won't be a deal,"" he said.The wave of earnings news could also help decide the direction. About a quarter of the S&amp;P 500 reports this week.""The earnings news has been mixed to some degree. We had some good reports last week, a couple big cyclical companies...[Stocks] got off to a great start this year, as we did last year and it feels like maybe we got a little ahead of ourselves,"" said Keon. ""...We're heading for a slowdown and the market is trying to figure out if it's a slowdown or recession. We still think it's a slowdown. Once you start slowing down, it's hard to know where you're going to stop.""Keon expects earnings to be flat this year, and estimates have been falling. As the fourth quarter earnings season progresses, analysts have been lowering earnings estimates for upcoming quarters. According to Refinitiv, earnings growth in the first quarter is expected to be just 1.9 percent, sharply lower than the 14 percent profit growth of the fourth quarter, which is currently being reported.Suzuki said he's keeping an eye on earnings growth.

We think the general trajectory for the market is higher. That being said I think it's going to be choppy. We had this nice run, and it's very possible the market starts to have doubts again,"" he said.Todd Sohn, a technical analyst at Strategas, said the mega cap tech reports this week could be very important, with Apple Tuesday, Microsoft Wednesday, and Amazon reporting Thursday. Apple pre-announced a big hit to its revenue from weak Chinese iPhone sales.""You want to see if Microsoft stays on its trajectory,"" said Sohn. ""Apple can not get anything going. You have to keep an eye on Amazon. That has also rallied back to its 200-day moving average, and that could be an area of congestion. It has struggled to break through it.""Sohn said on Jan. 18, Amazon briefly crossed above the 200-day moving average, a momentum indicator, but fell back below it. That level is now 1,715. ""I also want to watch the big weights, Adobe and Salesforce. These are the names that tried to rally back,"" he said.Sohn said the speed of the market's rebound from the December low is reason enough for a pullback. """"You could make the case for 2,600.

U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet that talks with China are going ""very well.""""With the U.S. and China in talks to de-escalate their trade conflict, the central bank showing a willingness to slow its tightening cycle and the economy still performing well, the markets may be looking a little more attractive,"" Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda in London, wrote in a note.The meetings are the first face-to-face talks since Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed in December to a 90-day truce in a trade war.Trade-sensitive stocks such as Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc and 3M Co rose between 1.2 percent and 1.6 percent in premarket trading.Trade and concerns over slowing growth have been at the heart of a selloff at the end of 2018 that culminated in Wall Street posting its worst monthly performance in about a decade in December, driving down earnings estimate and stock valuations.The S&amp;P 500 hit a record high on Sept. 21 before tumbling about 20 percent to a 20-month low on Christmas Eve.The index has climbed about 8.5 percent since then, with investors waiting for the fourth-quarter earnings season to kick off for a clear picture on how the trade war and a slowdown in global growth will affect profits.Analysts estimate S&amp;P 500 companies to increase their fourth-quarter earnings per share by 15 percent. That compares with expectations of 20 percent growth three months ago, according to Refinitiv IBES data.At 8:41 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 202 points, or 0.86 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 51 points, or 0.79 percent.Amazon.com Inc was up 1.7 percent premarket, adding to Monday's gains that helped the market power higher and the online retailer overtake Microsoft Corp to become Wall Street's most valuable company. Microsoft was up 0.9 percent.Though Monday's rally was led by technology and internet stocks, Samsung Electronics' profit warning due to weak chip demand again turns the spotlight on growth in the sector after Apple Inc's rare move to cut sales forecast.Goldman Sachs said in a note it expects semiconductor companies to face a challenging year, particularly in the first half.PG&amp;E Corp shares fell about 10 percent after S&amp;P Global Ratings stripped the California power utility of its investment-grade credit rating and kept it under review for a further downgrade.The shares have slumped about 22 percent since Reuters reported on Jan. 4 that the company was exploring filing for bankruptcy protection as it faces billions of dollars in claims from fatal wildfires in 2018 and 2017.(Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)"
153,2018-09-09T07:08:41-0400,"Amazon's financial services customers include the Carlyle Group and Ellie Mae.Amazon offers business lending and payment services.Microsoft, however, sees an opening to steal cloud business away from the retail giant.Microsoft views Amazon's entry into new business areas as a great opportunity to steal cloud customers.During an appearance at Citi's Global Technology Conference in New York on Thursday, Judson Althoff, the executive vice president heading up Microsoft's worldwide commercial business group, pointed to trust as one reason that Microsoft's public cloud is growing faster than Amazon's.""Amazon is frankly attacking a lot of industries right now, and they're pretty bold and open about it,"" Althoff said. ""I mean, Jeff will say, 'Look, your margin is my opportunity,' and there's evidence of that, huge evidence of that, huge evidence of that in retail, of course, but also financial services and health care.""Amazon's interest in retail is well understood following its acquisition of Whole Foods and the introduction of Amazon Go convenience stores. That expansion is already started to help Microsoft. In July Microsoft announced a five-year deal involving cloud with Walmart. Other Microsoft cloud customers include Costco and Kroger.To be sure, AWS does have its own retail customers, including Brooks Brothers and Under Armour.The company's interest in financial services is a lot less pronounced. Amazon has introduced some financial services products in the past, including Amazon Cash, Amazon Lending and Amazon Pay. But it looks like the company will not establish a full-blown banking service, Goldman Sachs analysts said earlier this year.If Amazon did move further into the finance business, Microsoft could peel some big cloud customers there as well. JPMorgan Chase is an AWS customer, as are financial services organizations like the Carlyle Group, Coinbase, Ellie Mae and Robinhood. The customer list for Microsoft's Azure cloud includes the likes of Bank of America, HSBC, MetLife and UBS. TD Bank uses cloud resources from both Amazon and Microsoft.Within health care, Amazon's plans are not as well known, although CNBC has reported on a number of areas being explored, including building its own health clinics for employees and making Alexa suitable for use in health care facilities. The company bought online pharmacy PillPack in June, and is working with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase on a health care initiative.AWS customers in the health sector include health systems like the Cleveland Clinic and pharmaceutical companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene and Merck.Retail, financial services, and health care are three of the six industries Microsoft's salespeople are particularly going after following a major reorganization that was instituted in mid-2017.""I think our enterprise customers come to us, going, 'Hey, look, we want to go to the cloud. We're not interested in going to the cloud with somebody who's interested in taking our business. Microsoft, you've known our business for decades.' So there's that enterprise trust factor,"" Althoff said.After this article was published, an AWS spokesman provided a statement.""It's always hard to comment on Azure growth since they've been unwilling to break out their revenue numbers, but if you look at absolute dollar growth, AWS is growing much faster than anybody,"" the spokesman said. ""It's typical to see comments like these from chasing competitors when they don't have the functionality and customer base to compete on their own merits."""

157,2018-09-03T09:39:06-0400,"The Nasdaq is poised to start September on a high, after its best monthly performance since the peak of the 2000 dot-com bubble. Big surges in tech names including Apple, Amazon, Cisco, and Nvidia propelled the index higher to hit records three times in the final week of the month. However, some of those stocks now look a little stretched to Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Jaffray.""Let's break down some of these stocks. First, if you look at Apple, this is almost a parabolic-looking chart and parabolic charts typically end poorly,"" Johnson said on CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Friday.Apple surged more than 19 percent in August, in its best monthly gain since April 2009. It made history earlier in the month when it passed $1 trillion in market cap, a first for a U.S. publicly-traded company.Some Wall Street bulls are looking at Amazon, or perhaps even Microsoft, as the next big tech titan to reach that milestone. First, they have to give back some gains, Johnson said.""Amazon, great-looking chart, but we'd be a buyer of that stock toward $1,825 on a pullback,"" Johnson told CNBC. Meanwhile, software giant Microsoft also has good technical indicators, with Johnson suggesting the stock would be a buy if it pulls back toward $105. On Friday, Microsoft closed above $112, while Amazon settled over $2000. A move to $1,825 in Amazon represents a 9 percent decline from its Friday close, while $105 in Microsoft would mark a 7 percent drop.Johnson added that its Cisco, an older tech bellwether, that could be poised for a run to the upside. The stock, trading under $50 with a relatively low market cap near $225 billion, may be a value pick for some investors.""Cisco has finally just broken out of the consolidation range it's been in since all of 2018,"" the analyst said. ""I can see a measured objective here into kind of the $51, $52 range on this breakout and that's a stock I'd be buying here today.""A move to at least $51 represents a 7 percent increase from Cisco's Friday close. It would also mark its highest level since late 2000.Like Johnson, Gradient Investments president Michael Binger liked Cisco, but also sees value in another tech leader.""We own Apple and Cisco right now,"" Binger said on ""Trading Nation"" on Friday. ""They're both cheap, they're both under 20 times next 12 months' earnings. Both fundamentals are really good right now. I think you could buy either one of those right now.""Cisco trades with a price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 16 times forward earnings, while Apple has a 17 times multiple. The Nasdaq Composite has a P-E ratio of 22 times forward earnings."

Revenue beat Wall Street forecasts, however. DR Horton said rising prices and higher interest rates have moderated demand for homes.Lear Corp. – The automotive systems maker earned an adjusted $4.05 per share for its latest quarter, beating the consensus estimate of $3.92 a share. Revenue came in slightly below forecasts. Lear said its results were solid despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and a 5 percent drop in global vehicle production.Starbucks – Starbucks reported adjusted quarterly profit of 68 cents per share, beating estimates by 3 cents a share. The coffee chain's revenue also beat forecasts, and U.S. comparable-store sales were up 4 percent from a year ago.Intel – Intel beat estimates by 6 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.28 per share.

Intel pointed to weaker demand in China as a key reason for its revenue weakness.Oracle – Oracle said Google's legal arguments to dismiss a nearly decade-old copyright case have already been examined and discredited. The Alphabet unit had asked the Supreme Court to reverse a ruling that revived a copyright case brought by Oracle back in 2010 involving the use of Oracle's Java programming language.MasterCard – MasterCard announced a deal to buy U.K. payments company Earthport for $304.1 million. Earthport had previously had a deal in place to be bought by rival Visa, but Earthport has now withdrawn its recommendation of that transaction.Microsoft – Microsoft's Bing search service has been restored in China, following a disruption that saw the service unavailable in that country. Microsoft said the company is investigating exactly why Bing was disrupted.Ericsson – Ericsson beat analysts' forecasts with its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue. The Swedish telecom equipment maker benefited in part from rising demand for 5G equipment.Discover Financial Services – Discover exported quarterly profit of $2.03 per share, falling 3 cents a share short of consensus forecasts. Revenue was in line with estimates, but results were hurt by loan losses among other factors.Western Digital – Western Digital missed estimates by 6 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of $1.45 per share.

Slowing growth in China — likely made worse by the ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies — is hitting American companies hard, experts say.Disappointing results from construction machinery giant Caterpillar and a pessimistic revenue forecast from chipmaker Nvidia point to a broader impact to the global business community from China's economic slowdown, analysts said on Tuesday.""Caterpillar and Nvidia are not the first companies to blame China for their afflictions, but both companies are seen as industry bellwethers,"" Rodrigo Catril, a senior currency strategist at the National Australia Bank, said in a Tuesday note.The outlooks from those companies — Caterpillar joined Nvidia in issuing disappointing guidance — ""tend to be regarded as important"" because they can ""provide a macro/global growth guidance from a business perspective,"" Catril told CNBC.So, the commentary from both of those companies paints a worrying picture for Chinese growth.""Their disappointing results provide further evidence that this time China's slowdown is for real,"" he said in the note.On Monday, Caterpillar shares fell 9.1 percent after the industrial giant posted weaker-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter, and issued that disappointing guidance. The company said specifically that its sales in the Asia Pacific region declined because of lower demand in China.Nvidia, meanwhile, dropped 13.8 percent after slashing its fourth-quarter revenue guidance to $2.2 billion from $2.7 billion. The chipmaker said ""deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, particularly in China,"" impacted demand for its graphics processing units.Those are not the only companies blaming China for slowing sales. Apple cut its sales forecast earlier this month, with CEO Tim Cook pointing to slowing iPhone sales in China.""(Caterpillar and Nvidia) highlight that, across a wide spectrum of businesses, China's faltering economy is also having an impact on the US,"" Tobin Gorey, a strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a note.Caterpillar derives 59 percent of its sales from outside of the U.S. and nearly a quarter of its revenue from the Asia Pacific region, according to figures from Goldman Sachs last year.Slowing growth in China — which has likely been made worse by the ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies — is hitting American companies hard, experts said.In fact, according to Gorey, the trade war ""highlights a very fundamental truth about US‑China relations.""""The two are unavoidably symbiotic. Both are huge influences on the world economy. The pair thus cannot separate themselves,"" he said. ""And the economic health of one correlates positively with the other. So if one inflicts pain on the other, they both eventually feel it too.""In December, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to halt any further tariff increases on each other's products during a 90-day period in which both countries would continue to negotiate a trade deal.Margaret Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets, said the guidance from Caterpillar and Nvidia paints a weaker outlook for the peak earnings season. More than 100 S&amp;P 500 companies are scheduled to report their earnings, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook.""The trade and growth uncertainties surrounding markets over the past few months has started to materialise and Trump's radical trade policy has resulted in adverse economic impact to even the American companies,"" Yang said in a note.Goldman Sachs in a Friday note warned its clients about companies with big revenues from China. In addition to Nvidia, it called out Broadcom, Micron Technology, Qualcomm, Qorvo, Skyworks Solutions and Wynn Resort.China last week reported that its 2018 economic growth rate came in at 6.6 percent — the slowest pace since 1990. J.P.

A case of 24 bottles of Idrasil costs $12,000, or $500 apiece for a 30-day supply.""I believe that having a prescription cannabis pill can be a big part of the solution because it is prescription-only, it is safe, and a non-addictive way for patients suffering from pain and other ailments,"" Papadopoulos said in a statement to CNBC. ""It's revolutionary and I am honored to be on the Board of Advisors.""The California-based company's CEO, Steele Smith, said he started the company years after his own bout with an addiction to opioids that he was prescribed to treat a rare form of Crohn's disease. He said he first started a medical marijuana dispensary, but eventually developed the doseable, prescribable cannabis pill that he hopes will disrupt the pain medicine market.Smith praised the Trump administration, and expressed a desire to contribute to it, in an interview.""The president has established an opioid commission that has within it a group of folks studying cannabis so that the president can make learned policy decisions related to cannabis,"" Smith said. ""And I want to be on that panel.""The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The CEO said he first crossed paths with Papadopoulos through LinkedIn.

""And he's a conservative Republican, like me.""Asked whether C3 has made contact with the Trump administration, Smith referred CNBC to Papadopoulos. The former Trump campaign advisor did not immediately respond to an inquiry about whether he reached out to the administration.Papadopoulos pleaded guilty in October 2017 to lying to the FBI about his contacts during the 2016 presidential election.After joining the campaign in 2016, Papadopoulos met with a Russia-tied professor who told him the Kremlin had ""dirt"" on Trump's opponent, Hillary Clinton, including ""thousands of emails,"" according to the special counsel's court filings. But Papadopoulos falsely told investigators that he met with that professor before learning of his role in the campaign.Mueller's team is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election, as well as possible Trump campaign collusion with the Kremlin and an inquiry into whether Trump obstructed justice. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.Papadopoulos was sentenced to be incarcerated for two weeks in prison, pay a $9,500 fine, serve 200 hours of community service and stay under supervised release for a year.

But Papadopoulos has ""shown that he's not a shrinking violet or a weak individual.

There are a couple caveats: The requirement applies only to suppliers with more than 50 employees and ""covers supplier employees who perform substantial work for Microsoft"" — though it's unclear what constitutes ""substantial.""""We have long recognized that the health, well-being and diversity of our employees helps Microsoft succeed,"" Dev Stahlkopf, general counsel at Microsoft, said in the post. ""We also know that we rely on a wide array of other companies to supply us with goods and services that reflect their core competencies, and that the people who work for our suppliers also are critical to our success,"" Stahlkopf said.Microsoft said it will assist its partners in complying with the new policy and realizes ""that this may ultimately result in increased costs for Microsoft.""In 2015, Microsoft announced a similar policy that would require suppliers to offer their employees paid time off.Read the company's full announcement:Building on our 2015 announcementThree years ago, we announced that we would require a wide variety of suppliers that do business with Microsoft in the United States to provide their employees with the important benefit of paid time off. Today we are announcing that over the next year we will take a further step, to ensure that these suppliers also provide their employees who handle our work with paid parental leave.We have long recognized that the health, well-being and diversity of our employees helps Microsoft succeed. That's why we provide industry-leading benefits for our employees, including comprehensive health and wellness programs for families, paid vacation, paid sick leave and paid time off for new parents.We also know that we rely on a wide array of other companies to supply us with goods and services that reflect their core competencies, and that the people who work for our suppliers also are critical to our success. That is why we took the step three years ago to require our U.S. suppliers doing substantial business with Microsoft to provide paid time off for their employees. Paid time off is good both for employers and employees, and it was the right step for our business. By implementing that requirement, we were able to focus our resources on businesses that share with us a commitment providing employees with important benefits such as paid time off. We believe now is the time to work with our suppliers to take a next important step.What we're doingOver the next 12 months we will work with our U.S. suppliers to implement this new paid parental leave policy. It will require that suppliers offer their employees a minimum of 12 weeks paid parental leave, up to $1,000 per week. This change applies to all parents employed by our suppliers who take time off for the birth or adoption of a child. The new policy applies to suppliers with more than 50 employees and covers supplier employees who perform substantial work for Microsoft. This minimum threshold applies to all of our suppliers across the U.S. and is not intended to supplant a state law that is more generous. Many of our suppliers already offer strong benefits packages to their employees, and suppliers are of course welcome to offer more expansive leave benefits to their employees.Our new supplier parental leave requirement is informed by important work on paid parental leave done in states, including Washington. In 2017, Washington state passed family leave legislation, including paid parental leave. This new law will take effect in 2020. As we looked at this legislation, however, we realized that while it will benefit the employees of our suppliers in Washington state, it will leave thousands of valued contributors outside of Washington behind. So, we made a decision to apply Washington's parental leave requirement more broadly, and not to wait until 2020 to begin implementation.Microsoft will work with our suppliers to understand the impacts of this change, and we will make these changes in a thoughtful way. We appreciate that this may ultimately result in increased costs for Microsoft, and we'll put a process in place for addressing these issues with our suppliers. Our first step will be reaching out to our suppliers to discuss the impact of this policy change.The case for paid parental leaveWe recognize today's announcement comes during an ongoing national dialogue about the importance of paid parental leave. The case for paid parental leave is clear. Studies show that paid parental leave enriches the lives of families. Women who take paid maternity leave are more likely to be in the workforce a year later and earn more than mothers who do not receive paid time off. Employers who offer paid time off for new mothers experience improved productivity, higher morale and lower turnover rates. And, paid parental leave is not solely a benefit for women. Data from California's paid family leave program shows that men take paternity leave at twice the rate and for longer periods of time when the leave is paid. This increased bonding and time spent caring for young children is correlated with positive outcomes such as higher test scores for these children. Further, when men and women have the opportunity to take paid leave, it can help counteract gender caregiving stereotypes, neutralize stigmas and promote equity in the home and office.Despite these clear benefits, just 13 percent of private sector workers in the U.S. have access to paid parental leave. And the lack of access to parental leave cuts broadly across professions — according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 22 percent of professional positions and 7 to 8 percent of workers in service and maintenance jobs have access to paid parental leave.Like many large employers, we welcome the opportunity to engage in the important national conversation about how all U.S. workers, regardless of where they work, can access paid parental leave. In the meantime, we will continue to focus our resources on doing business with companies that share our commitment to increase workforce inclusion and support employees and their families. As we gain experience with this new approach, we'll share what we learn with others. And as always, we'll look forward to learning more ourselves."

Women at Microsoft Corp working in U.S.-based technical jobs filed 238 internal complaints about gender discrimination or sexual harassment between 2010 and 2016, according to court filings made public on Monday.The figure was cited by plaintiffs suing Microsoft for systematically denying pay raises or promotions to women at the world's largest software company. Microsoft denies it had any such policy.The lawsuit, filed in Seattle federal court in 2015, is attracting wider attention after a series of powerful men have left or been fired from their jobs in entertainment, the media and politics for sexual misconduct.Plaintiffs' attorneys are pushing to proceed as a class action lawsuit, which could cover more than 8,000 women. More details about Microsoft's human resources practices were made public on Monday in legal filings submitted as part of that process.The two sides are exchanging documents ahead of trial, which has not been scheduled.Out of 118 gender discrimination complaints filed by women at Microsoft, only one was deemed""founded"" by the company, according to details in the unsealed court filings.Attorneys for the women called the number of complaints""shocking"" in the court filings and the response by Microsoft's investigations team""lackluster.""Companies generally keep information about internal discrimination complaints private, so it is unclear how the number of complaints at Microsoft compares to competitors.Microsoft said in court filings that the plaintiffs did not identify practices that impact enough employees to warrant a class action, and that it spends more than $55 million per year to promote diversity and inclusion. The company had about 74,000 U.S. employees at the end of last year.Microsoft said the plaintiffs cannot cite one example of a pay or promotion problem in which Microsoft's investigations team should have found a violation of company policy, but did not. A Microsoft spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment.U.S. District Judge James Robart has not yet ruled on the plaintiffs' request for class action status.A Reuters review of federal court cases filed between 2006 and 2016 revealed hundreds containing sexual harassment allegations where companies used common civil litigation tactics to keep potentially damning information under wraps.Microsoft had argued that the number of womens' human resources complaints should be kept secret because publicizing the outcomes could deter employees from reporting future abuses.A court-appointed official found that scenario""far too remote a competitive or business harm"" to justify keeping the information sealed."

But since hitting a 20-month low on Christmas Eve just a rounding error from levels considered to be a bear market, the S&amp;P has now gained over 9 percent.China has the ""good faith"" to work with the United States to resolve trade frictions, the foreign ministry said, while U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said he saw ""a very good chance that we will get a reasonable settlement"" as the two countries started their first face-to-face talks since a 90-day truce was agreed in December.""The main thing is the administration's implied progress on talks with China. That's something that market sees as very important,"" said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey.Ten of the 11 major S&amp;P sectors were higher. The biggest gain was logged by the consumer discretionary index, which jumped 2.74 percent, led by gains in Amazon.com Inc and Netflix Inc.Energy stocks gained 2 percent as oil prices climbed about 3 percent on support from OPEC production cuts.The technology sector gained 1.47 percent. The Philadelphia Semiconductor index, which consists of many companies dependent on China for revenue, jumped 2.76 percent.At about 1:20 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 239.90 points, or 1.02 percent, at 23,673.06.

This followed a Reuters report that the California utility is exploring filing for bankruptcy protection as it fears a massive charge in the fourth quarter related to potential liabilities from wildfires.With earnings season around the corner, investors have almost reconciled to a slowdown in fourth-quarter profit growth, but will scrutinize forecasts for signs of further weakness.""What will concern them will be the forecast, those will be critical to whether just producing a good bottom line number is enough for investors,"" Meckler said.Analysts now estimate fourth-quarter profit growth at S&amp;P 500 companies at about 15 percent, flat from a year earlier. That is lower than the 20 percent growth expected in early October, according to Refinitiv IBES data. The estimate for 2019 profit growth has fallen to about 7 percent from 10 percent.Microsoft Corp advanced about 1.2 percent, while Amazon gained 3.1 percent as the two companies vied to become the U.S. company with the largest market capitalization.Dollar Tree Inc jumped 6.3 percent after activist investor Starboard Value LP called on the retailer to sell its underperforming Family Dollar business and proposed replacing a majority of its board.Loxo Oncology Inc surged 65.8 percent after Eli Lilly and Co said it would buy the cancer drug developer for about $8 billion.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5.23-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 3.61-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&amp;P index recorded no new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 25 new highs and 11 new lows.

Three other fake domains were designed to look as if they belonged to the U.S. Senate.Microsoft didn't offer any further description of the fake sites.The Russian authorities denied allegations, the Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday. Interfax cited an unnamed Russian diplomatic source on Tuesday as describing Microsoft's allegations as part of a political game.""Microsoft is playing political games,"" it cited the source as saying. ""The (mid-term U.S.) elections have not happened yet, but there are already allegations.""Microsoft was acting like a prosecutor rather than a private company, Interfax quoted the source as adding.The revelation came just weeks after a similar Microsoft discovery led Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat who is running for re-election, to reveal that Russian hackers tried unsuccessfully to infiltrate her Senate computer network.The hacking attempts mirror similar Russian attacks ahead of the 2016 election, which U.S. intelligence officials have said were focused on helping to elect Republican Donald Trump to the presidency by hurting his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.This time, more than helping one political party over another, ""this activity is most fundamentally focused on disrupting democracy,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, said in an interview this week.Smith said there is no sign the hackers were successful in persuading anyone to click on the fake websites, which could have exposed a target victim to computer infiltration, hidden surveillance and data theft. Both conservative think tanks said they have tried to be vigilant about ""spear-phishing"" email attacks because their global pro-democracy work has frequently drawn the ire of authoritarian governments.""We're glad that our work is attracting the attention of bad actors,"" said Hudson Institute spokesman David Tell. ""It means we're having an effect, presumably.""The International Republican Institute is led by a board that includes six Republican senators, and one prominent Russia critic and Senate hopeful, Mitt Romney, who is running for a Utah seat this fall.Microsoft calls the hacking group Strontium; others call it Fancy Bear or APT28. An indictment from U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller has tied it to Russian's main intelligence agency, known as the GRU, and to the 2016 email hacking of both the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.""We have no doubt in our minds"" who is responsible, Smith said.Microsoft has waged a legal battle with Strontium since suing it in a Virginia federal court in summer 2016. The company obtained court approval last year allowing it to seize certain fake domains created by the group. It has so far used the courts to shut down 84 fake websites created by the group, including the most recent six announced Tuesday.Microsoft has argued in court that by setting up fake but realistic-looking domains, the hackers were misusing Microsoft trademarks and services to hack into targeted computer networks, install malware and steal sensitive emails and other data.Smith also announced Tuesday that the company is offering free cybersecurity protection to all U.S. political candidates, campaigns and other political organizations, at least so long as they're already using Microsoft's Office 365 productivity software.

Apple had combined numbers for the two items since it began reporting them in 2014.Apple had previously published its aggregate number sooner than other technology companies that broke them out separately because the FISA numbers are subject to a six-month reporting delay by law.Apple will also report the number of FISA requests for a user's content versus those not inquiring about such content.The changes will mean longer delays in Apple's reporting of overall national security requests. But the new format is similar to those for companies such as Microsoft and Google, making it easier for researchers and the public to compare.From January through June, Apple received 0 to 499 National Security Letters, which function somewhat like subpoenas, related to 1,000 to 1,499 users, the company said. Because of the reporting changes, Apple did not cite the number of FISA requests received for the first half of 2018 but will do so after Dec. 31.Apple on Thursday also changed the way it presents data on government requests, launching an interactive website that makes it easier for consumers to look up government data requests in their home country. It also offered the raw data in a format that makes it easier for researchers to upload into software programs.Apple said it received 4,177 ""account requests"" from the government related to 40,641 users. Law enforcement officials can seek information such as stored photos, email, device backups that might include text messages, contacts or calendars.Earlier this year, Apple said it was streamlining the online tools it offers for law enforcement officials to request data and would offer training courses on what kind of data officials can obtain from the iPhone maker.

Instead of buying it outright, however, as you might typically have with any other game console, you'll pay a small monthly fee for it. The Xbox One S costs $21.99 per month for 24 months while the Xbox One X costs $34.99 per month for 24 months.After two years, you own the console. The monthly payments also include access to Xbox Live Gold, which is required for playing multiplayer games online. It also includes Xbox Game Pass, which gives you access to more than 100 games you can download.Alone, the Xbox One X costs $500 while the subscription services cost $10 per month each.This means Microsoft has turned Xbox into more of a recurring revenue service. After two years, it can offer upgrades to newer models of the Xbox, similar to how Apple and wireless carriers offer upgrades to phone buyers, keeping them locked out from competitors."
174,2019-01-09T17:32:00-0500,"(Adds Amazon comment, updates share price)Jan 9 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, and his wife MacKenzie Bezos are divorcing after 25 years of marriage, the couple said on Twitter on Wednesday.Jeff Bezos, 54, has a fortune that has soared as high as $160 billion thanks to his stake in Amazon, which again became Wall Street's most valuable company this week, surpassing Microsoft Corp.Bezos has credited MacKenzie, 48, for her support when he uprooted the young couple to Seattle from New York to launch Amazon, an online bookseller that grew into the world's largest internet retailer.MacKenzie Bezos, a Princeton graduate who is now a novelist, did accounting for Amazon for its first year after it was founded in 1994.The couple decided to divorce after a long period of ""loving exploration"" and trial separation, and expect to remain partners in ventures and projects, according to the joint statement.Amazon shares ended up 0.2 percent on Wednesday. The divorce should have no material impact on the company and its shares, said Tom Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson &amp; Co.According to Refinitiv Eikon data, MacKenzie does not hold any Amazon shares directly, while Bezos has a 16.1 percent stake worth about $130 billion. Forbes magazine now estimates his overall net worth at $137.1 billion.Liat Sadler, a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer, noted that spouses owe a fiduciary duty to one another.They have duties not to waste or devalue marital resources, and to keep the value of marital property as high as possible, she said. I don't think there is an issue of concern for shareholders as to what will happen to Amazon because of the divorce.""Sadler said the main options facing the couple regarding Amazon stock were for Jeff Bezos to buy out his wife, or for MacKenzie Bezos to retain shares.""If she trusts that he would manage Amazon well, either he should pay her for her share of the stock, or they could enter a more complicated agreement where she keeps stock and he keeps voting rights, she said.It is unlikely that many details of the divorce will become public, according to New York lawyer Bernard Clair, who represents Judith Giuliani in her divorce from Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and current lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump.""These two have been separated for a not insignificant time, and I would assume ... they would have used the time to reach a private, confidential agreement, Clair said, referring to Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos.Reuters was unable to determine any further financial details of the planned divorce.""Jeff remains focused on and engaged in all aspects of Amazon,"" said Drew Herdener, vice president of communications for the company. He declined to comment on how the divorce might affect the ownership stake.MacKenzie Bezos met her husband when interviewing for a job at a New York hedge fund, according to a 2013 profile in Vogue.The two were engaged after three months of dating and married three months after that, according to the magazine. They have four children.Speaking at an event in Berlin last April, Jeff Bezos said his wife's support was instrumental when he founded Amazon.""When you have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risks,"" he said.Jeff Bezos in September committed $2 billion through the Bezos Day One Fund to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities. He had solicited ideas on Twitter in 2017 for ways to donate some of his wealth.Last January, the couple donated $33 million to fund college scholarships for U.S. high schoolers with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, an Obama-era program protecting young immigrants brought to the United States illegally by their parents.In 2012, they donated $2.5 million to a Washington state campaign to legalize same-sex nuptials there.From modest beginnings, Amazon branched out into almost every product category, taking on established retailers such as Walmart Inc.In November, Amazon picked America's financial and political capitals for massive new offices, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in New York City and a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C.Jeff Bezos also founded space company Blue Origin in 2000, and is funneling more than $1 billion a year of his own fortune into pulling it out of start-up mode and into production.He also owns the Washington Post, which has been a frequent target of criticism from Trump.

Armonk, New York-based IBM gets over 60 percent of its revenue from outside the United States.The company's cognitive software business, which houses artificial intelligence platform Watson, analytics and cybersecurity services, reported sales of $5.46 billion, compared with analysts' expectation of $5.25 billion.IBM's revenue of $4.32 billion from its global businesses services segment also beat estimates of $4.15 billion.Excluding special items, the company earned $4.87 per share, above expectations of $4.82.

Both sites determine which stories to feature based on a source's relevance and authority, though Bing also weighs ""readability"" and ""originality."" How do search engines decide how to rank news-related results?It's a top-of-mind question since President Donald Trump accused Google on Tuesday of prioritizing negative coverage from left-leaning outlets, an indictment that appeared to be based on an unscientific report by a conservative news site. Google also denied it uses political bias in search results.Google is by far the most popular search engine in the United States, with 86 percent market share, according to StatCounter. But there is an alternative: Microsoft's Bing.Although both search engines use algorithms that are largely a black box to outsiders, their own descriptions of how they rank news are largely the same. Both determine which stories to feature based on their judgement of a source's relevance and authority, though Bing also weighs ""readability"" and ""originality"" into its rankings.Here's how the two search engines determine what news to display.When Google's algorithm chooses which top news stories to display, it takes into account freshness, relevancy and authoritativeness, according to The Associated Press. It chooses which stories have ""authority"" based on judgments about the site publishing them, guided by fine-tuning from a group of 10,000-plus employees known as search quality raters who judge authority based on recommendations from professional societies, as well as factors like whether the outlet has won Pulitzer Prizes, clearly labels advertising or may intentionally deceive users.When Bing's algorithm chooses which stories to display, it takes into consideration whether the source of the news ranks well for newsworthiness, originality, authority, relevance and readability. Bing also has search quality raters, and defines ""authority"" as outlets that ""identify sources, authors and attribution of all content."" Readability includes sites that have correct grammar and spelling and where advertising doesn't interfere with the user experience. It defines ""originality"" as sites with unique facts or points of view.Bing also has a feature called ""Spotlight"" to provide overviews of certain news topics by showing a timeline of events from ""various perspectives"" (an example is shown below for the query ""NFL anthem kneeling"").

181,2019-01-27T13:56:12-0500,"98point6 is an under-the-radar company with an ambitious goal to improve access to primary care in America. Its founder hails from Microsoft, and its chief product officer is the former vice president in charge of scaling Amazon Prime from tens of thousands to millions of people.It is backed by private investors ranging from BlackRock's Larry Fink to ex-Goldman Sachs CFO David Viniar. For years, people have speculated about Amazon rolling out a health care service as part of Amazon Prime. Notable early Amazon investor John Doerr is already calling it ""Prime Health.""So far, that hasn't happened. But the former head of Amazon Prime, Rob Schwietzer, who was in charge of scaling the product to millions of people, is now working in health care. He left Amazon in 2013, and for the past year, he's been leading product at 98point6, a Seattle-based start-up that is looking to build the next consumer health brand.""Health care is really hard,"" Schwietzer told CNBC. ""But I do believe that people shouldn't have to make decisions about whether they should go see a doctor when they need one, or go buy groceries for their family.""Schwietzer has teamed up with CEO Robbie Cape, a Microsoft veteran who created Cozi, a family planning software venture, then sold it to Time. Back in 2011, Cape contacted Schweitzer out of the blue to get some advice on subscription businesses, as Prime was one of the few services millions of people were willing to pay for every month.To his surprise, Schwietzer responded and the pair had lunch.Years later, when Cape had the idea for 98point6, he reached out to his old friend Schwietzer. He had his misgivings about health care after a stint in consulting early in his career, but Schwietzer said he saw a big opportunity to bring ""price, quality, and convenience"" to the sector, similarly to what Amazon did for retail.""Why I think Amazon does so well,"" Schwietzer explained, ""is that where most companies will look at something and say 'we'll give it to you fast or inexpensive,' Amazon has always said 'why not both?'""Meaningful innovation in health care could not only create a huge business -- health care spending has now reached $3.5 trillion -- but also make a meaningful difference. Studies have shown that improving access to high-quality family doctors can help drive down health care costs and improve patient's health outcomes, but not everyone can afford it or reliably access it.That's because there's a shortage of primary care physicians and nurses in the U.S., which is only getting more pronounced with the aging population. People in rural areas are often hours away from the nearest clinic, and many will forgo care until they end up in the emergency room.Cape and Schwietzer are not the first entrepreneurs to hone in on this problem.A movement called direct primary care involves charging consumers a subscription fee for access to high-quality doctors, mostly in person. Direct primary care makes up less than ten percent of physician practices, but the Trump administration is now asking how it could help fund some of these practices for vulnerable seniors on Medicare.Other start-ups are trying to increase access to primary care by experimenting with virtual-only approaches, such as smartphone apps to connect doctors and patients, like Doctor on Demand or AmericanWell. In general, insurance pays for these services, or they charge patients a fee of $40 to $50 per visit.But 98point6 believes it's onto something different by blending these two worlds, and leveraging technology to bring down the price. It now offers a messaging service for patients and doctors to connect at an introductory price of $20 a year with no additional fees for a visit (after the first year, it costs $120).The subscription model can also help patient health by supporting an ongoing relationship between doctor and patient, Cape believes. ""Our hope is that will engage with our users literally every month about something related to their health,"" he said.Apart from the price tag, the big draw for consumers is the ability to message a doctor at any time. As more consumers start to use it, that will cut down on the administrative work that is ""burning out"" doctors, potentially turning them into advocates for the product.One example is the 98point6 assistant, essentially a bot, that conducts about half of the initial interview with the patient and presents that information to the doctor (Cape expects that percentage to increase over time, as the technology gets smarter).98point6 is also pushing to get companies to cover the service.The company told CNBC that about 50 self-insured employers have signed up so far, ranging from Seattle Children's Hospital to Washington-based Red Lion Hotels. Cape said that the utilization rate for their service, meaning the percentage of employees who take advantage of the benefit, is higher than most at about 6 percent (the average for telemedicine hovers around 2 or 3 percent for a number of reasons, including a lack of awareness among employees).As a result, growth is starting to take off. The company said it now has 160,000 members, either enrolled through their employer or paying for it out-of-pocket. As of January, it's licensed to practice medicine in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C.Cape recruited another Amazon cloud vet, Damon Lanphear, to run the technology team. It has also hired 16 doctors, including a chief medical officer who still practices, Brad Younggren. A former Surgeon General under the Obama administration, Regina Benjamin, now sits on its board.Investors seem to agree that there's big potential in the idea. 98point6 recently raised $50 million from Goldman Sachs' merchant banking division, with the rest flowing in from individual investors including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Costco founder and former CEO Jim Sinegal, former Goldman Sachs CFO David Viniar, and Frazier Healthcare Partners' managing partner Nader Naini.""There are younger generations of people who don't want to spend their time going to the doctor but are so comfortable using technology,"" said Viniar, who currently serves on the board of both Goldman Sachs and 98point6. ""And there are people in this country who live far from the doctor's office, or can't afford it,"" he continued.Outsiders note that 98point6 will face ample competition as it looks to grow from existing players in the digital health space, as well as potential new rivals like the major pharmacy chains that are dabbling in health care services and the largest technology giants. Both Amazon and Apple are building out medical clinics for their own employees, which suggests a willingness to get into the business of actually delivering care.""It'll be a clash of titans,"" said Michael Yang, a veteran health-technology investor and a managing partner with OMERS Ventures. But 98point6 has a good shot, Yang said, if what it ultimately comes down to is ""your starting point, your talent and your runway to get there.""But 98point6 is optimistic, is hoping to scale it to millions of people, on par with a household name brand like Amazon Prime.""Everyone claims to have a great value proposition,"" said Cape. ""But that needs to be combined that an experience that people literally want to talk about. An experience that is so good that you just want to tell people about it.""WATCH: Christina Farr tried the ketogenic diet with help from a gadget that tracked her progress -- here's what happened."
182,2018-08-03T12:41:57-0400,"Microsoft has been focusing more on generating revenue from the artificial intelligence and the internet of things categories.The company said social media could amplify issues that arise.Microsoft pointed to new risk factors connected to markets it's going after in its latest annual report, which came out on Friday.The company has warned investors before about the risks involved in cloud services, where it has become a bigger force. Now, as Microsoft seeks to execute on growth opportunities associated with artificial intelligence and devices that connect to the internet, it's flagging potential issues that could arise in those areas.While Microsoft doesn't acknowledge the dustup over its work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in its report for the year that ended on June 30, it does suggest there is the potential for ""brand or reputational harm"" that could arise from the use of certain AI technologies:Issues in the use of artificial intelligence in our offerings may result in reputational harm or liability. We are building AI into many of our offerings and we expect this element of our business to grow. We envision a future in which AI operating in our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers be more productive in their work and personal lives. As with many disruptive innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by Microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios present ethical issues. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.This isn't the very first time Microsoft is acknowledging that it could run into some problems in connection with AI. In its most recent quarterly earnings report, the company said its actual results could differ from guidance because of ""issues about the use of artificial intelligence in our offerings that may result in competitive harm, legal liability, or reputational harm,"" as VentureBeat reported.Even if Microsoft said the ICE work didn't involve AI, the controversy over that business relationship became inflamed as people discussed it on Twitter and other social channels, and indeed, in this year's annual report Microsoft says that social media could worsen the impact of issues:The proliferation of social media may increase the likelihood, speed, and magnitude of negative brand events. If our brands or reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our revenues or margins, or ability to attract the most highly qualified employees.Microsoft also acknowledged the risks that could develop as it does more with the so-called internet of things, including in the realm of personal security:The development of the internet of things presents security, privacy, and execution risks. To support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, we are developing products, services, and technologies to power the IoT, a network of distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities including AI. The IoT's great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain defects in design, manufacture, or operation, that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purposes. An IoT solution has multiple layers of hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several of which we may not develop or control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security of the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability to be updated or patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts of data, and our handling of IoT data may not satisfy customers or regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. If IoT solutions that include our technologies do not work as intended, violate the law, or harm individuals or businesses, we may be subject to legal claims or enforcement actions. These risks, if realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation or brands, or negatively impact our revenues or margins.Microsoft also suggested that it could face challenges because of changes in trade policies, like tariffs, which U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to impose. The company has previously talked about how tariffs can affect it, but this year it goes into more detail:Changes to trade policy or agreements as a result of populism, protectionism, or economic nationalism may result in higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, or other developments that make it more difficult to sell our products in foreign countries. Disruptions of these kinds in developed or emerging markets could negatively impact demand for our products and services or increase operating costs.Another interesting change: San Francisco start-up Slack, whose app lets team members set up chat rooms, is mentioned as an Office competitor for the first time in Friday's filing. Microsoft recently introduced a free tier of its Slack competitor, Teams."

184,2018-08-02T09:01:22-0400,"The Surface Go is Microsoft's more affordable Surface with a 10-inch screen.It starts at $399, but if you want one, you should buy the $550 model and a keyboard, too, CNBC's Todd Haselton says.I've been testing Microsoft's new Surface Go, the smaller and more affordable version of the Surface Pro laptop/tablet hybrid for several days.The Surface Go starts at $399, but the model Microsoft sent me starts at $550 before you add a keyboard, pen or mouse. It's a decent laptop, but not a very good tablet. And it's way too expensive for what you get.Here's what you need to know.I'm a little bummed. Going into this review, I was almost certain that I was going to end up replacing my iPad Pro 10.5 with a Surface Go. There's a lot to like about the device on paper.It runs a full version of Windows 10 but ships with Windows 10 S, a lightweight version that can only use apps from the Windows app store. Luckily, you can upgrade to the full version of Windows 10 for free and use any app you want after that. I'm a big fan of Windows 10, especially because I can run all of the apps required for work. I've been using the Surface Go exclusively for work since it arrived at my desk.I love the 10-inch size of the Surface Go. It's really light, weighing in at just over a pound even with the keyboard attached. I could barely tell it was in my backpack, which is a huge improvement over my work-issued Dell laptop that weighs several pounds. The touchscreen is sharp and bright, a vast improvement over what you'd get from similarly sized netbooks back in the day.The keyboard accessory, which will run you another $130, is compact, but not too small. I was able to get adjusted pretty quickly, but the keys sometimes felt a little too plasticky and sticky. It also has a large and accurate trackpad.I was able to do everything I needed for work pretty well. I often have more than 10 tabs open in Chrome and music playing on Spotify. Any modern laptop or tablet should be able to handle that, and the Surface Go did fine. But it did get sluggish as I started to run more apps. I liked it when I connected it to a Microsoft dock with HDMI and USB ports so I could use a larger screen and a full-size keyboard. It did a good job with all of that.I don't usually draw on the screen, but the Surface Go worked just as well with the Surface Pen as the Surface Pro does during my occasional use.I also like the design. I popped the keyboard off and caught up with TV shows at night while the Surface Go stood balanced on its pop-out kickstand, which feels sturdy and bends almost all the way back so the tablet is practically flush with the table. The kickstand wasn't ideal when I tried to use the Surface Go in my lap, but the whole thing is so small that it's still easy enough to balance. The speakers are good for such a small device and seemed to be on a par with my iPad Pro 10.5.The Surface Go also has Windows Hello, Microsoft's facial recognition feature that's used to unlock the device. I found it to be accurate, and it reliably unlocked my Surface every time I sat down. Apple is expected to add a similar feature to its new iPads this year.The model I tested ships with 128GB of storage, which should be enough for many. The base model only has 64GB, but there's also a microSD card slot on the bottom of the Surface Go that you can use to expand the storage without spending too much money.The Surface Go is a good laptop but a bad tablet. That's a problem, since the keyboard isn't included to give you that full laptop experience out of the box. Windows 10's tablet interface still stinks, and there aren't a lot of popular apps that were built for Windows 10 in tablet mode. The iPad still has the best library of tablet apps.I like using tablets for reading, but Amazon's Kindle app clearly wasn't built for the Surface Go, and Microsoft's bookstore lacks a lot of titles, including some on The New York Times' best-seller list. The Times, The Washington Post and other popular publications are also missing. While I could check any website, scrolling was sometimes too jittery and annoying, especially while holding the tablet with one hand in bed at night.Also, while Apple and other companies have worked to remove bezels — those large borders around the edge of the screen — from their gadgets, Microsoft didn't do that with the Surface Go. The Surface Go's bezels are so wide they're almost comical. While it doesn't hinder performance, it makes the tablet look dated from the get-go.Finally, battery life is pretty bad. Microsoft advertises nine or more hours of use, but I never got close to that. I usually saw about four or five hours of use with Chrome and Spotify open. I could save battery life by using Microsoft's Edge browser — Windows 10 said Chrome was draining the battery a lot — but I prefer Chrome.As far as ports go, there's just a single USB-C plug and standard headphone jack. (USB-C is the new USB standard that's starting to replace the USB you're used to.) Unfortunately, a lot of accessories still don't work with USB-C, so you might need to buy an adapter that adds more ports.I like the Surface Go a lot as a very portable work computer, but it's not the right solution for most people. It's too expensive for what you get.That stinks, because I had every intention of buying one before I tested it.The Surface Go starts at $399. That model includes 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM, but most people need more RAM than that for a good experience. You should at least buy the model I tested, which costs $549 and has 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. Keep in mind this is only for the tablet. The keyboard will cost you another $100. (The keyboard model I tested has a nicer finish and costs $130.) Before you even add the Surface Pen (another $100) you're already at $650.I wish Microsoft sold the model I tested with a keyboard for $400. That sort of price would change my mind.That's a tough pill to swallow.You can get plenty of decent and more powerful Windows laptops for that price, though they aren't as portable as the Surface Go. And if you want portability, Microsoft sells its far-better Surface Pro with a keyboard and faster Intel Core i5 processor for $799. That's the model you should buy. If you want to stick to portability or prefer a better tablet, just buy Apple's latest iPad, which starts at $329. Or consider a Chromebook.You should only buy the Surface Go if you need a Windows 10 computer but think the Surface Pro is too big and expensive. I imagine most people don't fit that profile though. If you need a tablet, go with the iPad. If you need a cheap computer, a Chromebook or cheaper Windows 10 laptop would suit you a lot better."
185,2019-01-27T09:00:18-0500,"Email remains the most-popular technology platform for consumers making complaints, but it does not get the fastest results, according to a new survey from Qualtrics.Facebook is No. 1 among social media platforms for complaints, but companies respond more slowly through it than through other social media. Organizations respond the quickest on Instagram. In a world of Yelps andsnarky corporate Twitter accounts, it's easier than ever to interact with companies. But as far as getting companies to respond — well, occasionally it feels like you're talking to a brick wall. If that sounds familiar, you're not alone.A recent study of more than 1,000 U.S. adults found that 85 percent of respondents said they believe organizations value their feedback, but paradoxically only 40 percent believed their feedback would have any impact. Two-thirds said the organization had either ignored their feedback or acknowledged it but took no action as a result.That said, there are things you can do to increase the chances you'll be in that one-third of people who spoke up and spurred action.About a third of respondents said their preferred feedback method was email. While email was the most popular platform, it may be setting people up for a mismatch in expectations, especially within the younger millennial crowd. Respondents overwhelmingly said they wanted a company to respond within a day — 80 percent of all respondents wanted an answer within 24 hours. However, those aged 18-24 said they expect an email response within an hour. Email just tends not to have that kind of speed.Respondents did, however, find a faster response time from companies when they took to social media, and about a quarter of respondents made that their feedback venue of choice. After all, social media is very public and it has the added benefit that you can't be stuck on hold. But not all social platforms are created equal for leaving feedback and getting an answer.More than half of people turning to social media log onto Facebook to give feedback on corporate pages, including complaints, giving praise, reporting a problem, or offering a suggestion. But across platforms included in the study —Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter — people who gave feedback on Facebook faced the longest response wait times and the lowest response rates. Of respondents using that site, 72 percent expected a response within 24 hours, and 68 percent got it. For people and companies using Facebook to give and act on feedback, the study showed that feedback was twice as likely to go unanswered on the platform.By contrast, the other three platforms all exceeded respondents' expectations for how quickly they wanted responses.For example, on Instagram (which is owned by Facebook), 60 percent of users wanted a response from brands within 24 hours, and 78 percent of people reported that organizations got back with them within that window. Across all the social media platforms in the study, organizations responded the most quickly on Instagram — organizations are 25 percent more likely to respond within minutes than on the next-quickest platform, Twitter.On Twitter, 64 percent of users expected a response within 24 hours and 73 percent said brands got back to them in that time. And among users giving feedback through LinkedIn (which is owned by Microsoft), 57 percent said they expected a response within 24 hours, and 89 percent got it. It is important to note, however, that volume may play a large role in response times as companies got only one-tenth the amount of feedback on LinkedIn that they got on Facebook.As much as the venue matters, so does the way feedback is presented. Brands are more likely to respond if feedback is clearly actionable. For complaining or reporting a problem, this means explaining the issue clearly and concisely. If you have a question or are requesting a specific action, make sure it doesn't get lost in the rest of your post. If something —good or bad — happened on a specific visit, make sure you include particulars. The clearer your ask, the easier it is for organizations to take action on your feedback.It's always in a company's best interest to respond to feedback. Listening when a customer speaks up is an incredible way to get feedback and improve service, and can be a boon or bust for companies — something the best companies know. At the end of the day, companies and customer service departments are made up of people, who might have had a bad day or who could be stressed or distracted or hungry. While it's not your responsibility to make sure they do their job, you can help make sure your message is clear.The industry you're talking about will make a difference, too. Our research showed that different sectors had vastly different response rates. Within that 24-hour timeframe, for example, people noted that government agencies and services responded within 24 hours only 36 percent of time. People reported somewhat better response timelines with retailers, noting that they responded within a day 59 percent of the time.Airlines, restaurants and financial services providers all had a 24-hour response rate about two-thirds of the time. Surprisingly, phone providers ranked highest, with people reporting that they heard back from phone providers within 24 hours 76 percent of the time.The gap between industry response times and what customers expect is worth noting: although only 52 percent of respondents expected government services to respond within the 24-hour timeframe, that category was still the one with the largest gap between what customers expected and what they got. The smallest? Airlines, with 73 percent of people expecting quick responses versus the 67 percent who actually got one. Considering these stats is useful for being realistic about a company's turnaround time. Again, it isn't your responsibility to make corporations or brands do their jobs, but managing expectations can be beneficial to your own emotional health.—By Mike Maughan, head of global insights at Qualtrics, a survey technology company used by many corporations to gain insights on their customers.Qualtrics was recently acquired by SAP for $8 billion.

187,2018-07-29T16:26:10-0400,"New data suggest Microsoft is posing more competition to the public cloud market leader, Amazon. The findings come as Amazon and Alphabet's Google release products that address a key area that Microsoft embraced before they did: ""hybrid cloud.""Microsoft again gained more market share in the cloud business than top competitors in the second quarter, one technology research firm said.The findings suggest Microsoft is posing more competition to the public cloud market leader, Amazon. They come as Amazon and Alphabet's Google release products that address a key area that Microsoft embraced before they did: ""hybrid cloud,"" which means customers can use a mixture of cloud services and software they run in their own data centers, and manage both with a common set of tools.In the second quarter, Microsoft Azure held 14 percent share in the cloud infrastructure market, Synergy Research said late on Thursday. Microsoft gained 3 percentage points of market share year over year, while Amazon was flat at 34 percent and Google was up 1 percentage point, coming in at 6 percent. Microsoft also had more share gains than Amazon and Microsoft in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, according to Synergy's calculations. (This market is distinct from software-as-a-service, and does not include hosted applications such as Microsoft Office 365, Salesforce, or Workday.)While reporting second-quarter earnings on Thursday, Amazon reported its cloud generated $6.11 billion in revenue, up almost 49 percent. Microsoft didn't disclose quarterly revenue for its Azure cloud but said Azure revenue grew 89 percent. Google didn't provide cloud numbers or growth rates for the quarter.On Microsoft's July 19 earnings call, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss asked CEO Satya Nadella about how customers are changing the way they use Azure. Nadella responded by saying that there haven't been drastic changes, but instead, a previously articulated approach, to provide the same tools to run applications in organizations' data centers and in the Microsoft cloud so that companies can move things to the cloud over time, is succeeding.The approach of providing common tools for on-premises and cloud applications is broadly known as ""hybrid cloud,"" and Microsoft's key product there is called Azure Stack, which Microsoft first announced in 2015.""People use both Azure Stack plus Azure, so that continues to drive a lot of IaaS growth for us,"" Nadella said, referring to the particular category of infrastructure as a service.A few analysts picked up on Nadella's comments.""We are pleased to hear of continued early traction with Azure Stack as we think it offers Microsoft a unique hybrid-cloud play,"" Stifel analysts led by Brad Reback wrote the next day.In the past few weeks, Amazon and Google have made announcements to more fully support customers that want to keep doing computing work on their own servers, rather than solely using public clouds.On July 17, Amazon announced new capabilities for Snowball Edge, a hardware device that was originally meant as a way to do lightweight computing and eventually move data into the Amazon cloud. Now customers can run a variety of standard EC2 virtual-machine instances -- each of which can perform multiple computing tasks -- on these boxes. EC2 instances are widely used for all sorts of computing tasks in Amazon's main public cloud.""If you need to move very large amounts of data into the cloud, or if this data sits in a location where it's not easily brought into the cloud, we need to give you the tools,"" Amazon chief technology officer said at a company event in New York.Then, earlier this week, Google introduced hybrid-cloud software called the Cloud Services Platform. One of the new technologies is GKE On-Prem. GKE stands for the Google Kubernetes Engine, which is a cloud tool Google offers to help customers manage containers — an alternative to more traditional virtual machines for running programmers' code. The new tool is similar, except it can work on companies' existing data center infrastructure.Amazon has introduced other tools for use in corporate data centers in the past, like providing broader access to the Amazon version of Linux, and Google has announced partnerships with companies that sell corporate data center gear, like Cisco and Nutanix. But the new moves indicate the cloud providers are more interested in meeting the needs of businesses, government agencies and other groups that don't want to depend exclusively on outside providers for their IT needs — or at least not yet.""I want to support the customer no matter where it is, and really, it's not a race,"" Google Cloud CEO Diane Greene said in an interview with CNBC earlier this week. ""This is a long-term play, and we want to do the right thing for the customers, because we want to be their partner long-term."""
188,2017-06-30T10:49:16-0400,"India is pressing Microsoft Corp to offer a sharply discounted one-time deal to the more than 50 million Windows users in the country so that they can upgrade to the latest Windows 10 operating system in the wake of ransomware attacks.Microsoft officials in India have ""in principle agreed"" to the request, Gulshan Rai, India's cyber security coordinator, told Reuters over the phone on Friday.A spokeswoman for Microsoft in India declined to comment on the matter.Officials at the company's headquarters in the United States and regional headquarters in Asia also declined to comment.If Microsoft agreed to such a discount, it could open up the global software giant to similar requests from around the world.Rai said the government was in talks with Microsoft management in India. It is not immediately clear whether any other countries were seeking similar deals.Rai said India began talks with Microsoft after the WannaCry ransomwareattack last month, noting that both WannaCry and this week's attack, dubbed by some cyber experts ""NotPetya"", exploited vulnerabilities in older iterations of the Windows OS.""The quantum of the price cut, we expect some detail on in a couple of days,"" Rai said, adding the Indian government expected the company to offer the software at ""throw-away prices.""""It will be a one-time upgrade offer to Windows 10 and it will be a discounted price for the entire country,"" said Rai, who was hand-picked by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be the country's first cyber security chief.Rai declined to be more specific, but said he was confident that it would be ""less than a quarter of the current price.""Rai,who has over two decades of experience in different IT areas including cyber security, said his team began coordinating with government agencies and regulators to push for OS upgrades soon after the WannaCry attack began on May 12.The government's quick action helped minimize the impact of the NotPetya attack, which affected two of India's container port terminals, he said.The government has also worked with banks to ensure that some 200,000 of the more than 240,000 ATMs in the country, most of which run on older Windows XP systems, have been upgraded with security patches released by Microsoft following the WannaCryattack, Rai said.This is just an interim solution, however, said Rai, because although the patches fix vulnerabilities in older OS versions, they retain the limitations of those versions.""New OS versions have different architecture, much improved architecture and much more resiliency,"" said Rai.Windows 10 Home currently retails for 7,999 rupees ($124) in India,while the Pro version of the software typically used by large companies and institutions costs 14,999 rupees ($232).Roughly 96 percent of an estimated 57 million computers in India currently run on Windows, according to Counterpoint Research. Apple and Linux-based systems account for the rest.Given that only a small minority of Windows users in India already have Windows 10, Microsoft could be forgoing several billion dollars of potential revenue if they agreed to sell just the more widely used Home version of Windows 10 at a quarter of its current Indian retail price.In the price-sensitive Indian market, people using computers in households or small businesses often do not upgrade their OS given the steep costs. The wide use of pirated Windows OS versions, which would not automatically receive security patches,exacerbate the vulnerabilities.In light of the attacks, Rai said, the government ""wants to incentivize the common man to upgrade their systems"".The WannaCry attack in May affected a state-run power firm in western India, while the NotPetya attack this week crippled operations at two port terminals in India operated by shipping giant AP Moller Maersk, which was affected globally."
189,2019-01-02T21:55:00-0500,"Jan 2 (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett has said he would love to see Apple Inc shares decline in price so he could buy more. He is getting his wish.Apple's warning on Wednesday about weak iPhone demand in the holiday quarter due to slower sales in China sent its stock down 7.5 percent during after-hours trading. Class B shares of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc traded down 2 percent in the same session on Wall Street.Buffett, the folksy Nebraska investor known more for buying railroads, energy firms and classic American corporate brands than for his acumen picking tech stocks, in recent years has lamented missing the boat on buying shares in U.S. technology giants. He admitted an earlier investment in IBM Corp was not one of his best.Yet Buffett has made Apple a centerpiece of his portfolio of other company's stocks, touting his own use of the Cupertino, California-based company's products and saying at his annual shareholders' meeting in Omaha last May, ""We would love to see Apple go down in price,"" so he could buy more at a bargain.Buffett sees Apple more as a consumer stock than a tech stock, reflecting the iPhone's status as a must-have possession for so many people.Including its after-hours drop on Wednesday, Apple's stock market value has tumbled to below $700 billion from over $1.1 trillion at its peak in October. Although Apple has fallen behind Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp in value, it remains one of Wall Street's most widely held companies.Shares of Berkshire itself have held up well even as the broader market sank last quarter. Last year, Berkshire returned 2.8 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 fell 4.4 percent, including reinvested dividends.But the $3 billion hit to Berkshire's Apple shares in evening trading on Wednesday could show in future reported earnings. Those figures do not reflect any long-term gains on Berkshire's investments, and Buffett has encouraged investors to ignore the profit statistic mandated by U.S. accounting practices.

190,2018-07-27T08:53:31-0400,"Microsoft employees questioned the company's chief executive, Satya Nadella, on Thursday, presenting him with a petition signed by more than 300,000 people that called on the software maker to cancel its contract with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, according to two people who attended the event.Mr. Nadella was attending an annual gathering with interns at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Wash., when the employees used the question-and-answer session to ask about the company's government contracts, said the people, who declined to be identified for fear of retaliation. One employee presented Mr. Nadella with a USB stick that contained the petition, along with the signatures, including 500 from Microsoft employees, they said.""We demand Microsoft stop enabling ICE's mission to punish families seeking safety,"" read the petition, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times. The petition also called for all tech companies that support the operations of ICE and the Customs and Border Protection agency to ""cancel their contracts.""More from the New York Times:George Soros bet big on liberal democracy. Now he fears he is losing.There is a revolution on the left. Democrats are bracing.The water wars of ArizonaThe presentation of the petition is the latest example of employee activism at large tech companies against the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy on immigration, which had resulted in children being separated from their migrant parents earlier this year. The White House has backed down from the policy, but the administration has struggled in recent weeks to reunite children with their families.Workers at several Silicon Valley companies were up in arms over the issue, but Microsoft came under particular scrutiny from its employees because the company has a contract for processing data and artificial intelligence capabilities with ICE. The agency had been separating migrant parents and their children at the border with Mexico. Last month, Microsoft employees circulated a letter that called on their employer to cancel all contracts with ICE, among other measures.In response, Microsoft said last month that to the best of its knowledge, its products and services were not being used by federal agencies to separate children from their families at the border. It added that it was ""dismayed"" by the Trump administration's immigration policy and urged that it be changed.The scrutiny comes as Microsoft has been positioning itself as a moral leader of the technology industry. Mr. Nadella and Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, have publicly said they wanted to protect user privacy and establish ethical guidelines for new technology like artificial intelligence.Microsoft declined to comment on Thursday's petition, but confirmed that Mr. Nadella had received the USB stick.The petition was started earlier this month by a coalition of nonprofit organizations calling for immigration reform. A group of Microsoft employees circulated the petition internally, collecting signatures. The group then decided to present Mr. Nadella with the petition and use the opportunity to raise their concerns directly with him, said employees involved in Thursday's encounter. They said they chose that day to present the petition because it coincided with the deadline set by a federal court to reunite children and parents who had been divided under the former policy.""Microsoft is complicit in profiting from a violent and murderous mass incarceration and deportation scheme,"" said Scott Roberts, senior campaign director at Color of Change, a civil rights advocacy group which helped start the petition. ""Microsoft must take action in the one way that will make an actual impact, canceling the contract."""

192,2018-08-13T18:49:28-0400,"It's difficult for patients to share medical records, especially between hospitals.Despite years of efforts to make it easier, there are strong economic incentives that keep health tech incumbents and care providers from fixing the problem.On Monday, a bunch of traditional tech giants, including Alphabet, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, and Salesforce, proposed a common set of standards and pledged to make products that support them. There are many broken things about the U.S. health care system. But one of the biggest and most overlooked problems is that patients still find it too hard to share their medical information between doctors, especially those working in different hospitals.It's a huge problem for many reasons: It makes it harder for consumers to access the highest-quality care, and new patients who walk into a hospital are like strangers — care-givers won't know if they have an allergy or a chronic disease.Some of the largest technology companies in the world are undertaking a new effort to fix that. And they have a good reason to do it, as the lack of open standards around health data is a huge barrier for them to get into the $3 trillion health system.On Monday, Alphabet, Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Salesforce spoke out at an event in Washington D.C. called the Blue Button 2.0 Developer conference. These companies are rivals in some important ways, so it's a strong signal that they came together on this issue.Here's the joint statement:We are jointly committed to removing barriers for the adoption of technologies for healthcare interoperability, particularly those that are enabled through the cloud and AI. We share the common quest to unlock the potential in healthcare data, to deliver better outcomes at lower costs.To address the problem, these tech companies are proposing to build tools for the health community around a set of common standards for exchanging health information electronically, called ""FHIR.""The government and the private sector have tried to fix this problem for decades, spending billions in the process. Unfortunately, the bulk of that funding was spent on moving doctor's offices from paper-based systems to electronic ones, and not on data sharing.There are strong economic incentives to keep things the same. The creators of market-leading medical records software, like Epic and Cerner, have no reason to open the door to deeper-pocketed tech giants. For providers, keeping information trapped within a hospital or health system makes it harder for unsatisfied patients to shop around and potentially leave. But in health care, unlike in most other sectors, that kills vulnerable patients.""These fee-for-service hospitals are fighting tooth and nail to retain patients — and the vendors are responding to these needs,"" Dr. Bob Kocher, one of the key architects of the Affordable Care Act and a health tech investor with Venrock previously told KQED in 2015. ""They [some hospitals] have not wanted features that make it easier to share information.""Ultimately, health insiders say, today's announcement is a recognition that that something needs to change.""Today's announcement is both a big deal, and just a start,"" said Aneesh Chopra, the former chief technology officer of the United States, in an interview with CNBC. ""The big deal is that the major cloud platforms, like Apple earlier this year, understand that a sector as complicated as healthcare benefits greatly from open standards."" (Apple has its own plans around medical records, which it made available on the Health app earlier this year.)""However, it is a start, as we have so much more work to do to standardize the entire health record, with the capacity for applications to read and write back to the patient's record without special effort,"" Chopra explained.Correction: A previous version of this story misattributed the publication to which Bob Kocher spoke. He was speaking to KQED."
193,2018-07-20T14:23:10-0400,"Analysts recognized that Microsoft is winning more high-value Azure deals and improving the cloud's gross margin.One analyst suggested the company's cloud transition is proving to be additive to its legacy products.Microsoft will soon be worth $1 trillion, according to a growing chorus of analysts.The company's latest earnings results, which showed continuing strong growth in its cloud business, has convinced some that the company is succeeding in moving its historic business model of selling licensed software to a subscription-based cloud model that could deliver more steady revenue and growth over time.Microsoft might not be the first company to the trillion-dollar mark — Apple on Friday afternoon had a $943.7 billion market cap, more than $100 billion ahead of Microsoft's $821.4 billion market cap, and Amazon and Alphabet are both ahead of Microsoft as well. But the company's valuation has grown considerably in the past four and a half years under Satya Nadella.Following the release of the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and guidance for the quarters ahead, some analysts raised their price targets on Microsoft stock, reaching as high as $130. To eclipse the trillion-dollar mark, Microsoft would have to reach $130.16.Piper Jaffray analysts led by Alex Zukin raised their price target from $123 to $130 in a Friday note.""With the company's sales organization firing on all cylinders and last year's re-org in rear view, we expect solid execution amid a strong demand environment to drive ongoing double digit growth,"" they wrote.The Piper Jaffray analysts noted that the growth-oriented Commercial Cloud group — including the Azure cloud, commercial subscriptions to Office 365 productivity applications and Dynamics 365 cloud-based business software — delivered 25 percent of Microsoft's total revenue, up 3 percent sequentially.Deutsche Bank's Karl Keirstead and Taylor McGinnis in a Friday note raised their target price from $120 to $130.""The 3QF18 print was terrific, and this one was even better, highlighted by MSFT’s very confident tone about the FY19 growth outlook and continued strong corporate IT spend,"" they wrote.Atlantic Equities analyst James Corwell raised his price target for the end of 2019 from $125 to $130 in his note on Friday.""Q418 was a very strong quarter for Microsoft with demand for both the company's cloud offerings and its on-premises products (server products, Windows) exceeding consensus expectations,"" Corwell wrote. ""Strength in the latter is particularly encouraging given the historical debate on the stock as to the extent to which the cloud will be additive or cannibalistic of Microsoft's legacy business. These results would appear to suggest that the transition is firmly additive, not just by expanding Microsoft's addressable market but also by increasing demand for its on-premises products.""Multiple analysts acknowledged in their notes that chief financial officer Amy Hood had said on Thursday's earnings call that Microsoft more than doubled the number of Azure agreements worth more than $10 million. At the same time, some noticed that Microsoft appears to be succeeding in making Azure more profitable.""For the seventh quarter in a row, Amy Hood noted that Azure gross margins improved materially,"" the Piper Jaffray analysts said. ""We would expect this to continue through FY19 driven by scale, premium revenue mix and internal infrastructure innovations and process improvements.""But Jeffries analysts led by John DiFucci wondered about where Azure's margins will end up in the long term, especially in relation to competing cloud Amazon Web Services, in their Friday note.""We don’t believe that Azure reaching scale and profitability in the same trajectory and fashion as AWS should be a foregone conclusion,"" the Jeffries analysts wrote. ""Given the competitive market and need to invest in both capex and operating expenses, profitability along AWS’s level may prove elusive for Azure for several years, if not forever. For example, we believe that AWS reported a similar operating margin compared to Azure’s GROSS MARGIN when AWS was the same scale as Azure is currently. We’re just saying ... there’s risk.""The analysts' updates this week come more than seven months after Evercore ISI analysts made the case for how Microsoft could reach the trillion-dollar valuation by 2020 or sooner — but at that time, their price target was $106."
194,2018-07-19T15:33:12-0400,"Microsoft beat expectations on earnings and revenue for the quarter.The stock soared on better-than-expected guidance.The company reported moderating growth of Microsoft's Commercial Cloud, which includes Azure.Microsoft stock fell briefly, rebounded and later surged on guidance on Thursday after the company announced strong earnings for the fourth quarter of its 2018 fiscal year, which ended on June 30.Here's how the company did:Earnings: $1.13 per share, excluding certain items, vs. 1.08 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.Revenue: $30.09 billion, vs. $29.21 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood told analysts on Thursday's earnings call that the company expects $27.35 billion to $28.05 billion in revenue. According to Thomson Reuters, analysts had expected Microsoft to forecast $27.38 billion in revenue, below the midpoint of the guidance. Microsoft stock shot up to more than 4 percent above the closing price of $104.40.As a whole, Microsoft grew revenue by 17 percent, according to a statement.In recent years CEO Satya Nadella has focused investor attention around the Commercial Cloud, a group of products including commercial tiers of the Office 365 productivity software, Dynamics 365 business software and the Azure public cloud. Commercial Cloud brought Microsoft $6.9 billion in revenue, up 53 percent. That's down sequentially from about 58 percent growth. In a Tuesday note, KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts led by Brent Bracelin had estimated that Commercial Cloud would grow by 46 percent.Microsoft, as usual, did not disclose exact revenue from Azure, but did say that it rose by 89 percent. The KeyBanc analysts had estimated that Azure on its own would yield $2.05 billion of the Commercial Cloud revenue, with 80 percent year-over-year-growth, down sequentially from 93 percent growth in the previous quarter. Analysts at Raymond James and Stifel also predicted 80 percent growth for Azure in recent days, while Credit Suisse analysts were more optimistic, looking for 84 percent growth.""The law of large numbers is kicking in,"" Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne told CNBC in an interview, referring to Azure's growth. ""The base is getting bigger. It is growing faster than AWS did when it was at a similar size. This is probably a $9 billion business growing at more than 80 percent.""The gross margin of Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud business segment, which includes Azure alongside products like System Center and SQL Server, improved.The margin improvement is primarily thanks to Azure, although it was ""offset in part by increased Azure sales mix,"" Microsoft said.Intelligent Cloud in total had $9.6 billion in revenue, growing 23 percent year over year. The FactSet analyst consensus for Intelligent Cloud revenue was $9.09 billion.The More Personal Computing segment -- containing Windows, devices, gaming and search advertising -- is larger, and in the fiscal fourth quarter it generated $10.8 billion, up 17 percent and above the $10.41 billion consensus.The Productivity and Business Processes business segment, which includes Dynamics, LinkedIn and Office, came in just above expectations, with $9.67 billion in revenue, rising 13 percent. The consensus slightly higher at $9.68 billion. LinkedIn on its own contributed $1.46 billion in revenue in the quarter, up 37 percent.Microsoft's gaming revenue grew by 39 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, at about $2.29 billion. Within gaming, Xbox software and services revenue rose by 36 percent, ""mainly from third-party title strength,"" Microsoft said.Revenue from commercial Office 365 subscriptions went up 38 percent as commercial seat growth slowed slightly to 29 percent. Microsoft said it had 31.4 million Office 365 consumer subscribers in the quarter, up sequentially from 30.6 million.Search ad revenue growth was flat sequentially, but it was up year over year, at 12 percent.Microsoft had a record $4.1 billion in quarterly capital expenditures. That number is up 24 percent year over year.In the fiscal fourth quarter Microsoft announced the $7.5 billion acquisition of code hosting company GitHub, as well as an Office 365 redesign. And it faced criticism for its collaboration with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.In Microsoft's full 2018 fiscal year, it had $306 million in restructuring expenses -- which were generally for sales and marketing changes made in the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year -- and a $13.7 billion charge related to U.S. tax reform enacted months ago. These costs aren't included in Microsoft's GAAP fiscal year numbers.Microsoft stock is up about 23 percent since the beginning of the year. The stock hit new all-time highs several times and crossed the $100 mark for the first time in the fiscal fourth quarter.-- Josh Lipton contributed to this story."
195,2018-07-19T13:40:09-0400,"Ballmer provided insight into why the stock didn't grow as much under him as it has under Nadella.Microsoft gave credit to Nadella for growing cloud services like Azure.Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer says that he and Bill Gates recommended current CEO Satya Nadella to the board, and he is not surprised he's doing a great job.In a recent interview, Bloomberg's David Rubinstein asked Ballmer if he was surprised when Nadella was chosen to be the company's new leader. Ballmer said no.“He’s the recommendation I made,” Ballmer said. ""He's the recommendation that Bill Gates made. I thought he was a candidate to replace me, which is why we moved him into his last job, which was running one of the big divisions. And I was glad he got the job, because he's done a great job.""Nadella has succeeded in changing the way the financial community views the company, Ballmer said. ""He’s done a good job of repositioning the company in investors' minds.""Microsoft has tripled its stock under Nadella's leadership, spanning almost four and a half years, whereas the stock's performance was not nearly as dramatic as it was under Ballmer. On Thursday the company is expected to report some $109.48 billion in revenue in its 2018 fiscal year, which would be up 13.3 percent, according to Thomson Reuters.Ballmer said Microsoft stock didn't grow to the degree that it has under Nadella, despite sales growth during his tenure, because he came in in 2000 at the height of the dot-com bubble and because a judge ordered that Microsoft be broken up in its U.S. antitrust case shortly after he took over.He said he felt investors thought he was spending too much money and were unsure if newer initiatives would result in major profits.Ballmer said Amazon has had more success than he had expected in the cloud business, where Microsoft is currently focused. But he pointed to progress with Microsoft's own cloud products.""We started this thing called Azure and Office 365, and my successor Satya has taken the thing to very much new heights,"" Ballmer said. ""The only chance to reposition the company really came when Satya started.""Ballmer remains Microsoft's biggest individual shareholder.Watch the full Bloomberg interview here."
196,2018-07-18T09:01:10-0400,"Under Nadella, Microsoft has moved away from proprietary phone hardware and operating systems.The company has centered its business around subscription products with regularly recurring revenue.After years of a stagnant stock price under Steve Ballmer, the stock has soared with Nadella at the helm.When Satya Nadella made his first public appearance as the new CEO of Microsoft in 2014, he did something very unusual for a leader of the software giant.""He made a pronouncement on day one — the world is about cloud first, mobile first,"" Microsoft Chairman John Thompson told a group of investors, entrepreneurs and reporters at an event earlier this month hosted by Lightspeed Venture Partners in San Francisco. ""He never mentioned Windows one time.""Windows was the proprietary Microsoft operating system that everyone knew and the foundation for so much of the company's success under Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer, Nadella's two predecessors. Thompson said that while Nadella's omission didn't attract much attention at the time, he was making a bold statement about what to expect under his leadership.""What he was telling the world was we at Microsoft have to be ready to embrace the cloud, and we at Microsoft have to be more about our technology running on all platforms,"" Thompson, who's a venture partner at Lightspeed, said at the event.Since that point, Nadella has delivered. Microsoft has emerged as a major vendor of cloud computing services, especially for big businesses, challenging Amazon Web Services in the rapidly growing cloud infrastructure market. And Microsoft has turned into an ally of the open-source development community, bringing some of its software to the Linux operating system.Investors have been particularly rewarded.During Ballmer's 14-year run, Microsoft's stock mostly went sideways. But since Nadella took over on Feb. 4, 2014, the share price has almost tripled, closing on Tuesday at a record $105.95. With a stock market value of over $800 billion, Microsoft is the world's fourth most valuable company, behind only Apple, Amazon and Alphabet.In addition to embracing open source, Microsoft has generally become a more friendly partner, and less of a feared adversary. Nadella has surprised people in the industry by announcing partnerships with competitors, including Red Hat, Salesforce and even Amazon — to boost the Azure cloud, Office apps and the Cortana voice assistant.Things looked very different in early 2014. At the Lightspeed event this month, Arif Janmohamed, a partner at the firm, asked Thompson why the board had selected Nadella to be Microsoft's new CEO.""Because no one in the Valley wanted a damn thing to do with Microsoft,"" Thompson said.Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore ISI, said Nadella has dramatically altered Microsoft's culture for the better. In particular, Materne said there's one important concept that Nadella focuses on in his 2017 book, ""Hit Refresh.""""'Empathy' is on every other page,"" Materne said in an interview. ""I think Microsoft came from a point where it was a little bit more of an our-way-or-the-highway kind of model. Clearly that's not where they are today.""Microsoft reports fiscal fourth quarter results on Thursday, and analysts are expecting the company to close out the year with 22 percent revenue growth to $109.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters, marking the fastest expansion since 1999. All that while maintaining the profit margins that investors demand.Microsoft's changing business model has largely focused on a move away from delivering packaged software and toward selling subscription-based cloud services.Getting to this point has been somewhat of a slog for Nadella. The average annual revenue growth over his four years is 6.5 percent, which is less than the 11 percent annual average under Ballmer.But today, close to two-thirds of Microsoft's revenue is recurring, coming from subscriptions that ""are inherently more sticky,"" than licenses Materne said. He also said the company is producing stronger cash flow now.Perhaps most importantly, Microsoft has regained its relevance in the developer community, after ceding its position of dominance to Apple, Facebook and Google.On Ballmer's watch, Microsoft sought to push Windows for mobile devices, first with Windows Mobile and then with Windows Phone. Microsoft also made the highly questionable (and ultimately disastrous) decision to pay more than $7 billion for Nokia's Devices and Services business.The deal closed two months after Nadella became CEO, and he initially sought to make it work. In a July 2014 memo, Nadella told employees the company ""will responsibly make the market for Windows Phone, which is our goal"" with the acquisition.It failed. The company took a $7.6 billion writedown on the Nokia deal in July 2015, with a plan for a more focused phone portfolio. Another writedown and more staff cuts followed in 2016.Speaking at a Salesforce event a few months after the big Nokia markdown in 2015, Nadella did a demonstration using an iPhone.""It's a pretty unique iPhone,"" he said, according to a Business Insider report. ""In fact, I'd like to call it the 'iPhone Pro' because it's got all of the Microsoft software and applications on it.""By 2017, with Android and iOS having taken firm control of the smartphone market, Microsoft had cut support for Windows Phone 8.1. Joe Belfiore, a vice president at the company, made it clear on Twitter that Microsoft would not be coming out with new Windows Phone features.tweetA few days later, Nadella made the matter even clearer, telling GeekWire, ""the reality is that we cannot compete as a third ecosystem, with no share position, and attract developers.""Meanwhile, Nadella was busy refining what Microsoft users do on the other big mobile operating systems. His first major appearance as CEO was to announce the launch of Office for iPad. Office support on Android phones and tablets followed within a few months.Microsoft brought its Edge browser — which debuted in Windows 10 — to Android and iOS, and there's an Android app launcher from Microsoft. SwiftKey, a popular virtual keyboard app that users can install on Android and iOS devices, was acquired by Microsoft in 2016. Even Microsoft's classic card games for Windows arrived on the two dominant mobile operating systems.Far from focusing strictly on organic growth, Nadella has paid up big for acquisitions. Microsoft spent $26.2 billion for LinkedIn in 2016, outbidding Salesforce, and last month snapped up code-sharing service GitHub for $7.5 billion.Those two deals brought Microsoft large networks of devoted users. They exemplify the goal Nadella laid out for Microsoft in the 2014 memo: ""We will reinvent productivity to empower every person and every organization on the planet to do more and achieve more.""The GitHub acquisition also emphasizes the importance Microsoft has placed on popular technologies that it doesn't need to directly control, said Bob Muglia, a former Microsoft executive who left in 2011 and is now CEO of Snowflake Computing.""The reality of the world today is modern developers are writing open-source code,"" said Muglia. ""They're not writing in proprietary environments.""By contrast, big acquisitions made under Ballmer were generally meant to to help Microsoft catch up in areas where it was weak, but without a coherent strategy, according to Evercore's Materne. The two biggest busts were Nokia and ad-tech company aQuantive.""As a result there was a view that Steve was sort of swinging and missing on all these deals,"" Materne said.In the past year, Nadella has made major moves internally, including a big sales reorganization to focus on cloud and subscriptions, and another organizational shakeup that involved the departure of 21-year veteran Terry Myerson, who was executive vice president of Windows and devices.Microsoft's emphasis was evident In the most recent quarter, as businesses including Azure, Office 365 cloud software, LinkedIn and Surface outpaced Windows commercial products.""The organizational changes Satya did exactly reflected the future of Microsoft as a company,"" said Muglia, whose company recently announced a partnership with Microsoft. ""This is just, once again, Satya recognizing the new reality that Microsoft is living in and really capitalizing on that.""In December, Materne and his colleagues issued a note predicting that Microsoft will reach a market cap of $1 trillion by 2020.In an interview he said, ""there's a general belief that they're heading in the right direction."""
197,2018-07-17T03:24:28-0400,"The five-year agreement is designed to leverage the full range of Microsoft’s cloud solutions in order to make shopping quicker and easier for customers, Walmart said.The agreement pairs Amazon’s largest retail rival with its closest challenger in cloud computing.Retail giant Walmart signed a deal to use Microsoft's cloud and artificial intelligence technology on Tuesday, deepening a strategic partnership between two of Amazon’s major rivals.The five-year agreement is designed to leverage the full range of Microsoft’s cloud solutions in order to make shopping quicker and easier for customers, Walmart said.The agreement pairs Amazon’s largest retail rival with its closest challenger in cloud computing. It is also the latest sign of Walmart’s willingness to double down on its e-commerce presence, while Microsoft has reportedly been working on a technology that could eliminate cashiers and checkout lines from stores.“Walmart’s commitment to technology is centered around creating incredibly convenient ways for customers to shop and empowering associates to do their best work,” Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in a statement on Tuesday.The Bentonville Arkansas-based company plans to boost its online presence and defend itself from Amazon’s rapidly growing retail ambitions.“The world’s leading companies run on our cloud, and I’m thrilled to partner with Walmart to accelerate their digital transformation with Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Tuesday.Through the partnership, Walmart and Microsoft engineers will work together to migrate a significant portion of Walmart.com and samsclub.com to Microsoft’s Azure, Walmart said."
198,2018-07-16T09:46:03-0400,"Microsoft has been hiring and training people to help it better address key industries, including retail.The company has seen an increase in cloud partners.Microsoft has made progress in important ways following changes instituted in its sales organization last year, according to executives there.Investors seem to like whatever the company has been doing. Microsoft's stock has continued to hit all-time highs in recent weeks, like other tech giants Alphabet, Amazon, Apple and Facebook. And the company is gaining share in arguably its most important market: the public cloud, where it represents the biggest challenge to Amazon Web Services.""The effects have been that we've had one of our best years ever if you just go through the first three quarters of the year,"" Gavriella Schuster, the Microsoft corporate vice president in charge of the company's One Commercial Partner group, told CNBC in an interview. She emphasized that Microsoft's Azure cloud achieved 93 percent revenue growth in the most recent quarter.Microsoft regularly institutes corporate changes in the middle of the year. But this shake-up was ""the most significant change in our global sales organization in Microsoft’s history,"" the company said in its 2017 annual report.One of the first big developments resulting from the new playbook was news of layoffs affecting thousands of employees. And earlier this month, a few more people were let go.But other changes were less visible from the outside.For one thing, Microsoft began to retrain its salespeople — around 10,000 of them, said Judson Althoff, the executive vice president heading up Microsoft's worldwide commercial business group. They doubled down in four areas — modern workplace, business applications, applications and infrastructure, and data and artificial intelligence.There is less going through PowerPoint presentations, and more digging into products right alongside customers, Althoff said.Some of the salespeople got new managers. And many customers wound up with better coverage from salespeople who were more familiar with individual industries, Althoff said. Microsoft focused especially on six: education, financial services, government, health, manufacturing and retail. While some local teams have focus on governments in years past, splitting up to go after certain industries was basically a new idea, Althoff said.Two of those six industries are especially interesting: retail, as that's Amazon's main business, and health, because Amazon has been increasingly active there. The Amazon factor wasn't the primary motivation for executives to choose those sectors, but its influence is still there.""We do feel like our customers in the retail space are in fact under a tremendous amount of pressure from our No. 1 competitor in the space,"" Althoff said. ""And so you see the notion of us feeling the need to empower those customers and them feeling the need to reinvent themselves. We see mutual alignment against the competition in this case.""But succeeding in different industries might not come easily. One person familiar with the effort said that developing serious industry skills is ""a multi-year journey."" Still, the person is confident that the reorganization will help the company, particularly in its cloud race against Amazon.Alongside the re-training efforts, Microsoft also hired about 3,000 people to write code alongside its customers, Althoff said.""Microsoft has become a destination for some of the strongest talent in the industry,"" he said, adding that many people have joined from competitors like Amazon, Google and Salesforce. The company has also plucked people out of less obvious sources of technology talent, like banks and hospitals, to succeed in the industry push, he said.Althoff joined Microsoft from Oracle five years ago, and he was elevated to the top level of leadership in 2016 — with the departure of operating chief Kevin Turner — and given marching orders to build ""the sales organization of the future,"" he said. Within a few months he began developing the new strategy.The other top leaders, including CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood, weighed in. Then a ring of about 80 vice presidents across the company got involved to go over the details. Then about 400 more people inside learned about the plans. Finally, in the first week of July, the memo went out to the thousands of employees in Althoff's organization, along with a webcast of executives highlighting the changes.The memo didn't make it perfectly clear, but another change in the fiscal year involved how Microsoft's salespeople get paid.A few years ago Microsoft tried aligning pay with actual use of the services that were being sold to customers. It was ""a great success,"" Althoff said, and so Microsoft broadened the practice. Last year was the first year in which around 80 percent of all compensation was based on consumption, he said.""We don't actually pay anyone,"" he said, until customers have used the services they previously made commitments to use.There are fewer critical metrics for salespeople to try to perform well on, too. There were so many, Althoff said, that people weren't sure what they should focus on.Microsoft has also established a group that works with customers long after they've agreed to buy — a function called customer success. The idea is to keep users sticking around and getting the most out of products — so they don't leave. Customer success teams are found at many cloud software companies, but Microsoft had simply never formed a group dedicated to the practice, despite the increasing focus on consumption.The company has also rethought the way it teams up with other companies.""We took seven different organizations that had significant partner sales teams within them and we brought them into one group,"" Schuster said. Practically speaking, there's one Microsoft employee working with any given partner, so companies can make investments relevant to everything the partner offers, rather than individual pieces, she said.And in the past year Microsoft's own salespeople began selling its partners' services, receiving 10 percent of the value of the partner's contract. The initiative has yielded some $5 billion in revenue for partners, Schuster said.Microsoft now has some 72,000 cloud partners who might offer software on Azure, help move workloads onto Microsoft cloud services or resell those services. That figure is up from around 60,000 last year and around 40,000 the year before that, Schuster said.And now 95 percent of Microsoft's commercial revenue comes from partners, up from 90 percent a year ago, Schuster said.The person familiar with the training challenges said the company won't be imposing more major changes in the new fiscal year, which started July 1.Considered together, Althoff said he's proud of the progress since the reorganization, which he said is perhaps the largest ever in the technology industry.""If we look at the Fortune 500, I would say to a number our relationships have increased materially with that base,"" he said. ""And we're just getting started."""
199,2018-07-13T12:45:15-0400,"Microsoft, Amazon and Google have all been ensnared in issues related to government adoption of artificial intelligence software.Microsoft said it will provide customers with more information when they're considering using itAmid increasing scrutiny around the government's use of artificial intelligence software, Microsoft said on Friday that it wants to see more regulation, specifically regarding technology that recognizes faces.""If there are concerns about how a technology will be deployed more broadly across society, the only way to regulate this broad use is for the government to do so,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, wrote in a blog post. ""This in fact is what we believe is needed today – a government initiative to regulate the proper use of facial recognition technology, informed first by a bipartisan and expert commission.""Microsoft, Amazon and Google are among the big tech companies investing heavily in AI, and each have faced pushback, including from employees, as reports detailed their work with government institutions. With Microsoft, there was concern that the company was supplying face recognition software to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as it separated families at the border. But Microsoft has since clarified that it's technology is being used only for more generic computing tasks, like email and calendar systems.Smith indicated in his post that Microsoft is well aware of the flare-up over its collaboration with ICE, and acknowledged that some people wanted Microsoft to stop working with the agency. He didn't announce any change of plans.Chatter about regulating tech companies has heated up in recent months, after it became clear how Facebook was used by outside firms to spread misinformation ahead of the 2016 election and as companies like Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Microsoft continue to see their stocks rise to fresh records.Microsoft has a long — and quite acrimonious — relationship with regulators, dating back to its antitrust case in the 1990s. We're in a different environment now, with the realization that software is being used in highly controversial and potentially dangerous ways.Smith pointed to several areas where the government could potentially create standards so that companies themselves wouldn't have to be self-regulate. For instance, he asked if people have the right to know about the photos that the government possesses that are associated with them. This type of work could require coordination with other countries, he noted.At the same time, Smith said, Microsoft will talking with customers, academics and privacy and human rights groups that deal with facial recognition.""This work will take up to a few months, but we’re committed to completing it expeditiously,"" he wrote.Microsoft also plans to be more transparent about its use of the technology.""If we move too fast with facial recognition, we may find that people’s fundamental rights are being broken,"" he wrote."

Slack has offered both free and premium options since its public launch in 2014.In promoting a free service, Microsoft may be leaving money on the table in the short term, but the company is betting that it will lure customers who will eventually be drawn to pay for Office as they grow and need more services and professional support. The free tier is limited to 300 users.Slack isn't the only competitor in the space. Last year Google introduced a Slack rival called Hangouts Chat as part of its G Suite bundle, less than six months after Microsoft unveiled Teams. Facebook also offers a chat app for work.With all of those options, an easy and free on ramp has become that much more important. ""We wanted to remove all barriers to entry for all business, individuals and work settings to be able to use it,"" said Lori Wright, general manager for Office 365 collaboration apps, in an interview. ""I suspect that people will find ways to use the software in all aspects of their lives, whether personal or for work, but our design lens is for work.""Microsoft doesn't view the free service as a lightweight version of the paid offering, as is the case with Slack. It's including availability in more languages and offering increased storage space, messaging search features and more integrations of third-party tools. It will also let users make group video and voice calls, while Slack's free tier only enables calls between two people at a time.Later this year Microsoft will enhance the free version of Teams with smart features, like translation of messages into different languages and a way to blur the background on video calls, to prevent messy rooms and other things from being seen by others. Perhaps most importantly the free edition of Teams will give users a way to access some of the most prominent Office apps — Word, Excel, PowerPoint and OneNote — which are integrated right into Teams. Customers get file storage courtesy of SharePoint and OneDrive.Not everything is included in the free product. Email hosting through Exchange or Outlook still requires clients to pay. But there's no guarantee clients will need it, as chat apps like Team and Slack are designed to lessen reliance on email for internal communication.Microsoft said in March that 200,000 organizations were using teams, less than half of the client base of Slack, which reported in May that 500,000 organizations are customers."
201,2018-07-12T06:00:32-0400,"Snowflake continues to offer its service atop Amazon Web Services.The price for Snowflake on Microsoft Azure in the U.S. is the same as it is through AWS.Hot enterprise-focused start-up Snowflake Computing said Thursday that it's making its software available on Microsoft's Azure public cloud. Previously Snowflake, which people can use to store and run queries on data, only ran on the Amazon cloud.The development is a good sign for Microsoft, which lags behind Amazon in the cloud infrastructure business.Snowflake CEO Bob Muglia rose through the ranks at Microsoft to one of its top positions over more than two decades before leaving in 2011. But the move to add Azure came from strong customer demand, particularly from retailers who compete with Amazon and are nervous about using its cloud services, Muglia told CNBC in an interview.For example, Nielsen, a company that already used Snowflake on Amazon Web Services, wanted to use Snowflake on Azure for a new product, Muglia said.""In this case, the customers they were serving were in the retail industry,"" he said. ""A number of those customers, particularly a large one based in Arkansas, have a fairly strong opinion about this.""That's presumably a reference to Walmart, which has preferred not to have software it uses run on Amazon's cloud, as The Wall Street Journal reported last year. Other retailers have been similarly reluctant to depend on Amazon's cloud services, given its e-commerce heft. Kroger, for example, has chosen to build on clouds from Google and Microsoft.But some retailers still do use Amazon's cloud, and Muglia said Snowflake itself has some retail customers that are perfectly happy using the software as it consumes AWS resources. It costs the same amount of money to use Snowflake on Azure in the U.S. as it does to use it on AWS, Muglia said.In another wrinkle, Microsoft Azure does have a cloud-based data warehouse service that could compete with Snowflake.""It's a fine product. It just doesn't take full advantage of the cloud because of its architecture,"" said Muglia, who was involved in Microsoft's acquisition of DATAllegro, whose technology, he said, the Azure service is built on.Snowflake said in January that it had raised $263 million in funding at a pre-money valuation of $1.5 billion."

The move isn't a sign of any changing strategy and is essentially the normal course of business for Microsoft, which began its 2019 fiscal year last week.In 2017, Microsoft cut thousands of jobs, or a total of less than 10 percent of its total sales force.  Microsoft performed the largest sales reorganization in its history last year."

Now at every single Starbucks,"" says Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM.Starbucks is jumping on the cryptocurrency bandwagon.The Seattle-based coffee giant is working with Microsoft and a leading global exchange on a new digital platform that will allow consumers to use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies at Starbucks.Starbucks along with Intercontinental Exchange, Microsoft and BCG, among others, is working to launch a new company called Bakkt that will enable consumers and institutions to buy, sell, store and spend cryptocurrencies on the global network by November.

""As a leader in Mobile Pay to our more than 15 million Starbucks Rewards members, Starbucks is committed to innovation for expanding payment options for our customers.""Cryptocurrency skeptics have challenged its use for payments because of its volatility. Bitcoin for example, has dropped by roughly 50 percent this year, and its value often changes by hundreds of dollars in a single day.But with Starbucks taking cryptocurrency seriously, it could help bitcoin break through as a mainstream currency. It could also be bullish for prices, which have struggled to find footing since the end of 2017.""It's very big news for bitcoin because people say, 'Where can you spend it?' Now at every single Starbucks,"" said Brian Kelly, founder and CEO of BKCM. ""Starbucks is seeing some kind of demand for acceptance of crypto and bitcoin, and to tie up with a huge regulated institution like the ICE is really positive for the space.""Starbucks would not be the first retailer to accept digital assets. Overstock.com was the first to accept bitcoin in 2014. Expedia, Shopify and CheapAir have also said they accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment."

It's a smaller 10-inch Surface with a starting price at just $399, which makes it a really compelling laptop-tablet hybrid for folks who don't want an iPad and who still want the full power of Windows. You might want to consider Microsoft's larger Surface Pro instead, though.Consider this: the Intel Pentium Gold-powered Surface Go costs $399 but that doesn't include a keyboard, you just get the tablet. Also, that's for a very basic entry-level model with 4 GB of RAM and just 64 GB of storage. Most folks who are going to be running multiple programs at once are probably going to want to upgrade to the next model up, the Surface Go with 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage.That configuration costs $549 and, again, you still don't get the keyboard, which costs an additional $100. All in, with the keyboard and the model I think most people should buy, you're looking at $649.Microsoft's Surface Pro typically costs $799 on the low end without a keyboard, but the company is currently selling a bundle deal Surface Pro with an Intel Core i5 processor, 8 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage with a keyboard for $799. That bundle typically costs $1,159, so it's a pretty solid deal. The Core i5 chip is much more powerful than the Intel Pentium Gold in the Surface Go, too, which means you can run more powerful software, including power-hungry apps like Adobe Photoshop.The trade-off is portability, since the Surface Go is smaller, but even the 12.3-inch Surface Pro is a really good on-the-go computer. I've never complained about the weight or size of it in my backpack; it's much more convenient than even my work-issued Dell computer for work on the road. Plus, there's a bit more room on the Surface Pro keyboard than there is on the miniaturized Surface Go.Right now, if I was ordering a new Surface laptop, I'd go with the $799 Surface Pro and keyboard bundle Microsoft is offering. You just get so much more for the price, and I think it's worth the extra $150 over the $649 you'd pay for midrange Surface Go. But you should order it soon if you're in the market — Microsoft's bundle deals don't last forever."

The company expects free cash flow of about $12 billion for the year, compared with expectations of $12.67 billion.IBM said revenue slipped to $21.76 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, but came in above analysts' average estimate of $21.71 billion.Throughout the year, the strengthening of the dollar cost over $2 billion of revenue in 2018, Kavanaugh said.The Armonk, New York-based technology services giant makes over 60 percent of its revenue from outside the United States.The company's cognitive software business, which houses artificial intelligence platform Watson, analytics and cybersecurity services, reported sales of $5.46 billion, compared with analysts' expectation of $5.25 billion.IBM's revenue of $4.32 billion from its global businesses services segment also beat estimates of $4.15 billion.Excluding special items, the company earned $4.87 per share, above expectations of $4.82.(Reporting by Pushkala Aripaka in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)"
206,2018-07-09T21:06:48-0400,"Microsoft just announced the Surface Go, its most affordable Surface laptop ever.The Surface Go has a 10-inch display, comes with 64 GB of storage and costs just $399.The Surface Go will be released in August.Microsoft on Tuesday announced the Surface Go, the newest addition to its family of Surface-branded computers and laptops. It's the cheapest of the bunch — it starts at $399 — and is targeted directly at the Apple iPad and a crop of affordable Chromebooks running Google software.I had a chance to check one out during a quick product briefing with Microsoft.I like the smaller 10-inch design and that Microsoft mostly kept the same familiar form factor as earlier Surface tablets, complete with a kickstand that pops out from the back of the tablet. I've found the kickstand usually works well, although it's hard to keep on my lap.I also like that it can be connected to a full computer display and used more like a traditional computer, which you can't do with an iPad.The $399 starting price gets you a bare-bones model with just 64 GB of storage, which isn't much, but there's a slot for adding additional storage in the back of the computer. Microsoft still doesn't include a keyboard or one of its Surface Pen styluses, so expect to spend a couple of hundred dollars more for those if you want more than the bare-bones touch-screen experience.I'm a bit torn on the size. It's small, with a 10-inch screen, and has big bezels — the areas around the screen — which means it's not nearly as attractive as an iPad.Also, the keyboard seemed a little cramped during my brief hands-on with the Surface Go, though on a par with what I've used with an iPad Pro.That said, the screen looked sharp and wasn't cheap, as one might sometimes find in more affordable laptops.Short of a full review, which will come closer to when the Surface Go hits the market on Aug. 2, I think the Surface Go hits a lot of areas that I think Microsoft needed to address against Apple's low-cost iPad.It's the first Surface product that's priced competitively with an iPad or Chromebook — the larger Surface laptops start at $799 — it's designed to run all Windows apps (save for high-powered ones, given it operates on a relatively low-power Intel Pentium Gold chip), and some models will include built-in LTE for a connection wherever you go.It's too early to call this a winner for Microsoft. It'll need to be able to perform well and run multiple apps at the same time, and battery life will be a concern given its tiny form factor. (Microsoft says it should run up to nine hours.) The Surface Go looks promising, though."
207,2018-06-30T11:05:34-0400,"Microsoft is reportedly planning to launch a new kind of device that folds in half and can fit in a pocket.A report suggests it will carry Surface branding and launch sometime this year.Microsoft hasn't launched a successful mobile product in more than a decade, even though it has tried.Several reports over the last several years have suggested Microsoft is working on ""Project Andromeda,"" a new type of Surface-branded computer that can fit in your pocket. According to an e-mail that was recently obtained by The Verge, Microsoft thinks this will be a ""new and disruptive category,"" and that the ""pocketable Surface"" will ""create a truly personal and versatile computing experience.""I sure hope Microsoft has some tricks up its sleeves.Microsoft hasn't been relevant in the mobile space since the iPhone launched in 2007. It's not for lack of trying -- Microsoft first attempted to compete with changes to Windows Mobile and then, when that failed, with the release of Windows Phone and eventually Windows 10 for Phones. Those initiatives are all dead now, along with Nokia's mobile phone business, which Microsoft swallowed in 2013 in a last-ditch effort to matter in mobile.The company has done an admirable job with other hardware, such as its Surface family of computers that run Windows 10. Revenues from that segment rose 32 percent year over year during the third quarter, which suggests the branding might finally be catching on with consumers.Those are full-fledged computers and tablets, though, and not devices that fit in our pockets. Renders deemed accurate by The Verge suggest Microsoft's ""Andromeda"" Surface will have a touch screen display that can fold in half. That means customers will likely need to interact with Windows 10 -- I don't think Microsoft will try another mobile operating system -- without a keyboard. An included stylus might help, though that reeks of the poke-and-type days of Windows Mobile and PDAs.The processor might also pose a similar problem Microsoft has faced before.The Verge also said Microsoft hasn't decided on whether or not it will use Intel or Qualcomm processors. That's an important distinction, because Windows 10 is an awful experience on Qualcomm's ARM chips, since it doesn't support every Windows app. If Microsoft picks Qualcomm, it would be making the same mistakes it made with Windows Phone and the ARM-powered Surface RT -- many customers wouldn't get the apps they want.Finally, if this is a phone and computer hybrid of sorts, Microsoft is going to have to show the world why they'll want this over products that run Android or Apple. Nearly all phones sold in the world now run either Android or iOS, despite efforts by dozens of other company's attempts, including Microsoft's, attempts to break that apart.I want a new form factor of gadget. I think laptops and tablets and phones are getting boring. And Microsoft has proven in recent years that it has the chops to build great hardware. I just hope it has a better mobile plan in place than it did the last two times it tried."

209,2018-06-28T14:05:40-0400,"LinkedIn has tapped Azure for video delivery and for machine translation.Google and Amazon also offer cloud-based translation tools.Business social network and recruiting tool LinkedIn is increasingly relying on technology from its parent company, Microsoft. On Thursday LinkedIn said it's tapping a service running in Microsoft's cloud data centers to translate the text of its users' posts into different languages.The decision suggests that LinkedIn is becoming more integrated into Microsoft's own systems, rather than doing everything on its own as a separate, standalone company that just happens to be owned by Microsoft. The adoption could help Microsoft's push in the cloud business, where it competes with the likes of Amazon and Google.To translate people's words into dozens of languages, LinkedIn has begun using the Microsoft Translator Text application programming interface, LinkedIn software engineer Angelika Clayton and tech lead Bing Zhao wrote in a blog post.To use the new feature, users can hit the new ""See translation"" button in foreign-language posts they spot in LinkedIn's main news feed. ""For this feed feature, we selectively translate source text into 24 target languages, to match each member's interface locale supported by LinkedIn,"" Clayton and Zhao wrote. Users can rate the translations with as many as five stars.The feature should be available soon if it isn't appearing yet, a spokesman said. Right now, information on profile pages and in comments cannot be translated, but LinkedIn is thinking about how it can expand translation, the company said.Facebook and Google have also taken steps to add in-house AI translations into their products in recent years, and Amazon and Google offer cloud translation systems for developers that compete with the Azure system that LinkedIn is using.This isn't the first time LinkedIn is tapping Azure. The Microsoft subsidiary has also chosen Azure to help with providing users' videos in the app.Azure is the flagship of Microsoft's growing commercial cloud business, which also includes Office 365 and Dynamics 365. In the first quarter, commercial cloud brought Microsoft $6 billion in revenue, and Azure revenue growth exceeded 90 percent. In that quarter LinkedIn revenue was up 37 percent, at more than $1.3 billion."
210,2018-06-25T15:47:37-0400,"Amazon has hired at least 30 executives from Microsoft in the years between 2015 and 2017.That's more than from any other tech giant.There are many reasons for this trend, including Amazon and Microsoft's close proximity, but brand image and compensation may have to do with it too.When Ruhi Sarikaya, Amazon’s director of applied science, spoke at the World Wide Web conference in April, an Echo device on stage introduced him as the person “building my brain.”Then it shared a fun fact about his previous job: he founded a key group within Microsoft’s Cortana voice-assistant team.“His group has built language understanding and dialog management capabilities of Cortana,” the Echo said.Sarikaya, who spent five years at Microsoft before joining Amazon in 2016, now leads a team of over 200 engineers for Alexa Brain, according to a person familiar with the matter. His team is responsible for building the core AI technology for Alexa’s natural language processing and dialog management, among other key capabilities, his LinkedIn profile says.Besides the irony of one person building the same core technology of two competing products, Sarikaya’s jump to Amazon highlights a broader hiring trend: Amazon’s penchant for poaching Microsoft executives.In fact, Amazon has hired more executives from Microsoft than from any other tech giant in recent years, according to Paysa, a startup that collects and analyzes work salary information.In the three years between 2015 and 2017, at least 30 director or higher level executives went straight from Microsoft to Amazon. Google, the next most popular poaching ground for Amazon, lost just 5 executives to the e-commerce company during those three years. Apple and eBay both lost 2 executives to Amazon in that period, while Facebook, Walmart, and Netflix saw zero executives go to Amazon.Paysa’s data only includes people whose most recent jobs were at Microsoft and excludes the ones who may have worked elsewhere before joining Amazon. The company said it looked through at least 5 million resumes for this data, but may have missed the ones that did not update their resume profiles.Many of the Microsoft transplants now sit in the highest ranks at Amazon.For example, VP of eCommerce services Dave Treadwell, who spent over two decades at Microsoft, joined Amazon in 2016 and now reports directly to Jeff Wilke, CEO of Worldwide consumer. Marc Whitten, former chief product officer at Microsoft, is now a VP reporting directly to Amazon’s hardware chief Dave Limp. Dirk Didascalou, Amazon’s VP of Internet of Things, was most recently a corporate VP leading Microsoft’s Surface Hub group.Amazon declined to comment on this story. Microsoft’s representative wasn’t immediately available for comment.It’s hard to single out one definite reason for this trend. The companies' close proximity in the Seattle area may be the most obvious reason. Amazon’s rapid expansion and need to hire senior managers quickly — its headcount more than doubled to 577,000 employees from 2015 to 2017 — explains part of it too.But the more practical reason may have to do with the two companies’ respective brand image, hiring experts say.Sarikaya, for example, was in part moved by Alexa’s commercial success and wider popularity than Cortana, said one person familiar with his decision. Besides its already dominant online retail service, Amazon is also the market leader in cloud computing and is experimenting with a number of futuristic projects. That includes cashierless stores and drone delivery services — cultivating a more fast-moving, innovative image.“Amazon is seen as more exciting, more at the edge — the creative innovator that has disrupted every market,” said Michael Useem, a management professor at the Wharton school of business. He added his MBA graduates made Amazon their top job choice at a much higher rate than even just three years ago.Microsoft’s history of churning out talented executives may be drawing Amazon recruiters too. Just like IBM was a popular place to recruit from for many decades, and McKinsey &amp; Co. remains a top recruiting ground in finance, Microsoft continues to have a reputation for training high-quality tech talent, said Tom Lee, a management professor at the University of Washington.“Microsoft is a very well known place to get a pool of reliable people that you know are going to be pretty good,” Lee said.Compensation may be another factor. In a recent company-wide survey, the number of Microsoft employees who said their compensation was competitive declined for the third straight year, as did the number of employees who said they were rewarded appropriately for their performance.Amazon, meanwhile, seems to be offering large signing bonuses to recruit top talent. According to a survey run by anonymous workplace app Blind and published in May, Amazon had the highest number of employees that received a signing bonus, with many of them indicating their signing bonuses to be over $100,000. On top of that, Amazon’s stock price has jumped a whopping 430 percent since 2015. In February, Amazon for the first time eclipsed Microsoft’s market cap, which roughly doubled in the same time span.“The big driver for Amazon right now as a recruiter is money — they’re willing to pay way above market,” Greg Lambert, CEO of TERRA Staffing, a Seattle area recruiting firm said. “It wouldn’t be unheard of for them to be going after Microsoft because they do seem vulnerable.”"

The firm's previous rating under another analyst was neutral.“Azure has replaced Windows as the platform underpinning Microsoft's enterprise offering, and we forecast it exceeding $100 billion revenue over the next decade,” Cordwell wrote. “With Office 365, Microsoft has already established a strong position in the software as a service market and there remains robust growth potential as the greater accessibility of the cloud delivery model continues to drive expansion in the user base and customers steadily upgrade from basic packages.”Cordwell’s Microsoft price target of $125 represents 24 percent upside from Friday’s close.Competition in the cloud computing space is on the rise as Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services vie for dominance in the enterprising software business.The former, however, appears to be quickly establishing a foothold in the space and eating into Amazon's stronghold, with the company’s share of the market jumping to 13 percent from 10 percent approximately one year ago, according to findings from Synergy Research Group and Canalys.“While Azure is not going to establish the monopoly position that Windows enjoyed, we believe it is addressing a much larger market that is still in the early stages of development,” Cordwell said. “We model Amazon Web Services and Azure reaching $185 billion and $115 billion revenue in 10 years’ time, implying roughly 70 percent combined share of the market at that time.”The analyst forecasts that the Redmond, Washington-based company will report fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.09 and full-year EPS of $3.87, just above consensus estimates provided by FactSet.In its latest report, Microsoft posted earnings and revenue results in April that easily topped Wall Street estimates, raising its sales expectations for later in the year.At the time, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company's upcoming 2019 fiscal year will show continued revenue growth ""driven by the transition to cloud services.”Overall, Microsoft's revenue grew 16 percent year over year in the quarter, according to its earnings statement.

All 30 of the Dow Industrial components were in the red.China's factory activity contracted for the first time in 19 months in December, hit by the Sino-U.S. trade war, with the weakness spilling over to other Asian economies. Euro zone manufacturing activity dropped for the fifth month and barely avoided contraction.The grim readings come ahead of the closely watched U.S. manufacturing survey on Thursday, payrolls data on Friday and the U.S. earnings season later this month, which is expected to show corporate profit shrunk in the October-December quarter.""Increasing evidence of China's economy weakening further has sent chills throughout global markets.

I mean, he came on stage to almost no applause at all — and at the end of his speech, a little grudging applause.""A rise of populism has been a pressing concern for those at the Forum, with nationalist and far-right parties making significant electoral gains worldwide in recent months.Brazil's president arrived in snow-clad Davos less than three weeks after his inauguration. His sweeping electoral victory late last year marked a dramatic swing away from the left in Brazil.Critics of the so-called ""Trump of the Tropics"" have expressed deep concerns about his brazen praise of the country's former dictatorship and by his comments concerning women, race and human rights.Chatham House's Niblett pointed out that Bolsonaro's keynote address at WEF was in stark contrast to this time last year, when French President Emmanuel Macron came off the Congress Center stage ""like a rock star surrounded by the crowds.""Macron was widely considered the European leader to watch 12 months ago, with the world's business leaders audibly excited to hear his ambitious plans to reform the country.However, the French premier is currently struggling to appease a momentous backlash against his administration.The so-called ""yellow vest"" uprising, named after the high-visibility jackets protesters wear during demonstrations, has prompted Macron to stay away from the annual meeting this week.And he is not alone.Several world leaders have chosen not to attend the January get-together, choosing to fight domestic crises rather than be seen socializing with the rich and famous.The absence of some of the biggest names in Davos has thrust Bolsonaro firmly into the spotlight.""We think Jair Bolsonaro has a big chance to reform the country,"" Francesco Starace, chief executive at Enel, told CNBC on Tuesday.""His agenda is a reform agenda. If it is populist or not populist, we don't care — it is a reform agenda that we think is good for the country and the country needs it,"" he added.Bolsonaro has attended a number of working lunches with global institutional investors in Davos, hoping to showcase the ""unique point in time"" his country is going through. He was spotted on the same dinner table as Apple CEO Tim Cook and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Wednesday.The photo of the unlikely group was widely shared on social media, after Axios reporter Felix Salmon posted it to Twitter, likely due to the seemingly conflicting views Bolsonaro holds to those of Cook and Nadella.When CNBC's Nancy Hungerford asked whether Bolsonaro was capable of delivering on his promises, Itau's Latam Chairman Ricardo Marino replied: ""That's the big question.""""The top priority is, for sure, the approval of the social security reform,"" Marino said.The country's benchmark stock index reached a fresh all-time high on Thursday, amid improving investor sentiment about the new government's pension reform plans.On Friday, the Bovespa — one of 2018's top performing indexes worldwide — stood at 97,677 points."

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella gave a philosophical response Thursday to the major challenges that are currently being faced by tech companies, underling the guiding principles that he and his firm follow.Speaking in front of an audience at the VivaTech conference in Paris, he said artificial intelligence (AI) is the ""defining technology of our times.""Rather than fear the rise of this technology, which could be something that transcends even human capability, Nadella said that his developers, and their rivals, follow a set of human values and principles that guide the choices they make.""The future we will invent is a choice we make, not something that just happens,"" he said.The Microsoft chief executive was quick to cover topics like data privacy and cyberattacks in his speech. He joined French President Emmanuel Macron Wednesday at a ""Tech for Good"" event alongside Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, IBM's Virginia Rometty and Intel Corp's Brian Krzanich. The topic of privacy has made headlines this year with Facebook, in particular, engulfed by the Cambridge Analytica scandal.Nadella said the big tech had a ""tremendous responsibility"" that it had to scale, recognize and act upon.""When we think about the responsibility, let's think about privacy, I mean on May 25 the world will change with GDPR — we will now have to operate recognizing that privacy is a human right,"" he said, name-checking new EU rules coming into effect on Friday.""Just this week, we announced that the core subject data rights that are at the core of GDPR is something that we will take to every part of the world that we operate in,"" he added.On security and cyberattacks, Nadella said it was the the citizens of the world and the small businesses that get most impacted. ""We have to as a tech industry — and governments — really step up to ensure that those vulnerable populations and organizations are protected.""The focus on privacy protection and a responsibility to do good was echoed by Cisco Systems Chief Executive Chuck Robbins, who called GDPR — the EU's General Data Protection Regulation — ""exemplary,"" speaking to CNBC's Karen Tso at the same event.""Everybody can debate details, but I think it's been a very positive process for us,"" said Robins, who heads the multinational technology conglomerate with more than 70,000 employees worldwide.

215,2018-06-18T16:34:51-0400," Some people became angry about Microsoft's cloud collaboration with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Certain remarks about the work briefly disappeared. Microsoft said that an employee did it and that it was a mistake. The company said it urges Congress to make law that stops the government from separating immigrant children from their parents. Microsoft on Monday faced criticism about its work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as the agency came under fire because of separations of immigrant children and their parents at U.S. borders.The issue reflects the challenge that tech companies face as they seek to gain big customers. Microsoft, Google and Amazon are all working to win government work in their cloud units. Amazon has faced criticism over the use of its image recognition software for the purposes of surveillance, and Google had internaldisagreement over its work with the Pentagon. Now, Microsoft has faced more backlash for its work due to widespread condemnation of the Trump administration's family separation policy. This weekend, as more details about the detention centers surfaced, people discovered a blog post describing Microsoft's work with ICE, the agency responsible for enforcing immigration laws, and questioned Microsoft's relationship with the agency. One consultant, Mat Marquis, said he had ended his contract with Microsoft in connection with the issue.tweetBut then part of the blog post was deleted, BuzzFeed reported. Microsoft returned the deleted section and suggested its deletion was a mistake.""An employee briefly deleted the blog after seeing commentary in social media. This was a mistake and as soon as it was noticed the blog was reverted to previous language,"" a spokesperson told CNBC.Ultimately, though, Microsoft — which has taken stances on immigration and other political issues before — issued a statement indicating it did not support splitting up families: As a company, Microsoft is dismayed by the forcible separation of children from their families at the border. Family unification has been a fundamental tenant of American policy and law since the end of World War II. As a company Microsoft has worked for over 20 years to combine technology with the rule of law to ensure that children who are refugees and immigrants can remain with their parents. We need to continue to build on this noble tradition rather than change course now. We urge the administration to change its policy and Congress to pass legislation ensuring children are no longer separated from their families. Microsoft first published details about its work with ICE in January to promote the fact a part of Microsoft's Azure public cloud got a certain type of approval necessary for certain government contracts.""This [authorization] is a critical next step in enabling ICE to deliver such services as cloud-based identity and access, serving both employees and citizens from applications hosted in the cloud,"" Tom Keane, general manager for the Azure government business, wrote in a blog post. ""This can help employees make more informed decisions faster, with Azure Government enabling them to process data on edge devices or utilize deep learning capabilities to accelerate facial recognition and identification.""Keane added that the company is ""proud"" to help support the agency's work.The Trump administration implemented what it calls a ""zero tolerance"" policy of criminally prosecuting everyone who illegally crosses U.S. borders. The policy results in splitting up migrant children and parents.Activists, religious groups and bipartisan members of Congress have criticized the separation of families as immoral and inhumane. Many critics have urged Trump to abandon the policy. The president appears to have no intention of doing so, unless Congress acts to end the policy while also passing funding for his proposed border wall and limits on legal immigration."
216,2018-06-18T09:00:00-0400," Flipgrid will become free for schools to use; Microsoft will give subscribers refunds. The two companies announced a partnership in 2016. Flipgrid integrates with numerous Microsoft products. Microsoft has acquired Flipgrid, an education start-up with an app that lets students record and share videos on specific topics with their classmates.Terms of the deal, announced Monday, weren't disclosed.The move shows Microsoft remains eager to win share in education, where Google's Chromebooks have become popular. Microsoft is making Flipgrid free of charge. Schools that already have subscriptions will receive prorated refunds, Microsoft said.The acquisition comes one and a half years after Microsoft announced a partnership with Flipgrid. Today, Flipgrid integrates with many Microsoft products, including Teams for chatting with other people and OneNote for taking notes. But Flipgrid has paid to use Amazon Web Services cloud, which competes with Microsoft's own Azure.In the U.S., nearly 60 percent of all mobile personal computing devices that were shipped to K-12 schools in the fourth quarter were Chromebooks, while less than 26 percent used Windows, according to Futuresource.Microsoft sought to strengthen its education strategy with the release last year of a Surface Laptop and Windows 10 S, which is limited to running apps downloaded through Microsoft's app store to deliver sufficient performance and security.Hardware is just part of Microsoft's challenge at schools, though.  Google introduced Google Classroom in 2014 as a place for teachers to give out assignments and for students to hand them in, using the company's productivity apps like Google Docs. In 2016, Microsoft unveiled a similar tool called Microsoft Classroom as part of its Office 365 productivity software package for education. It has since retired that product and added assignment features to Teams. But Flipgrid on its own is much more focused on video than Teams, with more than 20 million users. And it will retain its brand, rather than get pushed into Teams, Microsoft says.The start-up was founded in 2015 and headquartered in Minneapolis, with 24 employees listed on LinkedIn. Competitors include Recap and Seesaw."
217,2018-06-14T02:14:52-0400," Microsoft is working on technology that would eliminate cashiers and checkout lines from stores. It would be a nascent challenge to Amazon.com's automated grocery shop. The Redmond, Washington-based software giant is developing systems that track what shoppers add to their carts. Microsoft is working on technology that would eliminate cashiers and checkout lines from stores, in a nascent challenge to Amazon.com's automated grocery shop, six people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The Redmond, Washington-based software giant is developing systems that track what shoppers add to their carts, the people say. Microsoft has shown sample technology to retailers from around the world and has had talks with Walmart about a potential collaboration, three of the people said.Microsoft's technology aims to help retailers keep pace with Amazon Go, a highly automated store that opened to the public in Seattle in January. Amazon customers scan their smartphones at a turnstile to enter. Cameras and sensors identify what they remove from the shelves. When customers are finished shopping, they simply leave the store and Amazon bills their credit cards on file.Amazon Go, which will soon open in Chicago and San Francisco, has sent rivals scrambling to prepare for yet another disruption by the world's biggest online retailer. Some have tested programs where customers scan and bag each item as they shop, with mixed results.For Microsoft, becoming a strategic ally to retailers has meant big business. In addition to developing retail technologies, it ranks No. 2 behind Amazon in selling cloud services that are key to running e-commerce sites, for instance.It is not clear how soon Microsoft would bring an automated checkout service to market, if at all, or whether its technology would be the answer retailers are looking for. But some see the technology as the next big innovation in shopping, one that Amazon's competitors cannot afford to ignore.""This is the future of checking out for convenience and grocery stores,"" said Gene Munster, head of research at Loup Ventures in Minneapolis. The venture capital firm estimates the U.S. market for automated checkout is worth $50 billion. Cashier is one of the most commonly held jobs in the United States.Microsoft said it ""does not comment on rumors or speculation."" Walmart and Amazon declined to comment.Microsoft's effort to date has largely fallen under its Business A.I., or artificial intelligence, team, one person said. A group consisting of 10 to 15 people has worked on a host of retail store technologies, and they have presented some of their efforts in front of CEO Satya Nadella, the person said.In a meeting with the team several months ago, Nadella recommended an ""intelligent edge"" device that could manage connected gadgets such as cameras on site with minimum data transfers to the cloud, which would cut down on costs, said the person.Making its technology cheap enough so it does not eviscerate grocers' already thin profit margins is a major challenge for Microsoft, another person said.Microsoft already showcases the basics for automated checkout at its Retail Experience Center in Redmond.It has half a dozen partners, including Redmond-based AVA Retail, that are building their own checkout-free or related services atop Microsoft's cloud, some of the people said. Sales of partners' services result in cloud revenue for Microsoft, along with insight into the market for new retail technologies.Meanwhile, Microsoft's internal team, including a computer vision specialist hired from Amazon Go, has worked on attaching cameras to shopping carts to track customers' items. And it has studied novel ways for smartphones to play a role in the shopping experience, people said.Still, the industry is playing catch-up to Amazon.The company spent four years building Amazon Go in secret, before launching an employee-only pilot on its Seattle campus in 2016. It collected data for nearly 14 months more before opening the doors to its first Seattle store. Amazon has said it has no plans to introduce checkout-free technology to its Whole Foods Market grocery chain, which it acquired last year.The company is still hard at work improving the service. Amazon Vice President Dilip Kumar told Reuters in an interview earlier this year that the company is training computers to identify items or activities with as little information as possible.""It's a really hard problem,"" said Scott Jacobson, managing director of Madrona Venture Group, adding it's ""one that Amazon is uniquely positioned to solve."""
218,2018-06-13T09:00:00-0400," The simplified version of the ribbon will show up first in the online version of Word and will come to more Office apps and on different platforms later. New colors and icons should make Outlook and the other Office apps more accessible. The announcement comes two months after Google unveiled a Gmail redesign. Microsoft is redesigning its Office productivity apps to make them easier to use, as it faces stiffer competition from Google.Microsoft said Wednesday it's refreshing Office 365 apps, including Word, Excel, Outlook and PowerPoint, in part so that they're more accessible for users with disabilities. The company is vastly reducing the size of the ribbon — the toolbar that for so many years has been loaded up with buttons.Users who prefer the traditional ribbon can switch back with a single click. The Office revamp comes two months after Google unveiled a redesign for Gmail. Google has been gaining traction in the business world with its suite of cloud-based office apps. But Microsoft needs to keep up the momentum in Office 365, which remains one of the company's top growth opportunities. As part of the update, icons have been modernized so that their functions are more obvious. When working in a document, users can hover over comments to get them to change color, and on the Office website, they can hover over the name of a file to get it to virtually pop forward.Microsoft is bringing the animations of its ""fluent"" design system to Office apps. Above the ribbon, the category of options you're currently viewing is underlined in blue, and the underline appears to move swiftly when you select a different category. The changes aren't just cosmetic. Microsoft will also start letting you pin to the ribbon individual features that you use often, just as you can pin certain apps to the start menu in Windows.The search box in the Office website and apps will automatically offer you suggestions of people and files based on your usage, and the search suggestions will vary by app.So far, the new features have been made available to a small group of paying users of Office.Jon Friedman, Office's chief designer, told CNBC that the company is paying close attention to customer feedback so it can make the necessary refinements before pushing changes across different operating systems and applications. The new ribbon, for example, is coming to the web version of Word before it shows up anywhere else. ""We're very confident that it's a step in the right direction,"" Friedman said."

Then it folds up into a phone. While it's just a prototype, it's an example of a trend that's likely to occur in the coming years, as popular device makers begin to sell products with folding screens.Check it out for yourself:The Xiaomi device, as you can see in the video above which was posted to Xiaomi's social networks and later put on YouTube by The Verge, looks like a normal tablet at first. But, later in the clip, the tablet is folded into thirds, with the left and right side bent behind the center. The tablet suddenly becomes about the size of a large cellphone, a form factor that makes sense for some things that a tablet doesn't work well for, like placing phone calls.Xiaomi isn't the only company taking advantage of advancements in display technology.LG at CES 2019 unveiled a TV that can completely roll itself up when you're not watching it. Samsung also recently revealed a prototype phone that can unfold into a larger, tablet-like device. It promised the new phone is ""coming soon."" Rumors have long suggested that Microsoft has been working on a Surface product that can fold in half. Apple hasn't publicly talked about plans for a folding device, but it has sourced its iPhone displays from Samsung, which means the tech is ready if it wants it.The software is ready, too.Operating systems running on these new products will need to know what to do when a user bends it in half. Google's Android operating system officially started to support foldable devices in November, when Samsung revealed its prototype.""You can simply unfold the device to get a larger tablet-sized screen. As you unfold, the app seamlessly transfers to the bigger screen without missing a beat,"" Android's vice president of engineering, Dave Burke, said at the time.Meanwhile, The Verge said earlier this month that Microsoft has been building support for foldable displays into Windows. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Motorola is planning to relaunch the Razr phone as a foldable device.And yet, we're still waiting for consumer-ready devices we can actually buy. News on that front may be just around the corner.At the Mobile World Congress in February, where lots of companies typically unveil new smartphones for the global market, it's likely we'll see advancements in foldable products. Samsung is expected to unveil its official foldable phone at its annual Galaxy phone launch event on Feb. 20.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."
220,2018-06-12T05:09:38-0400," Sony showed off in-depth gameplay trailers for upcoming PlayStation 4 titles including ""The Last of Us Part II"", ""Spider-Man"", ""Death Stranding"" and ""Ghost of Tsushima"" at E3. The trailer that got huge attention was for ""The Last of Us Part II"" which showed two women kissing then transitioning seamlessly into the title character Ellie cutting a person's throat. Sony's press conference came a day after Microsoft's where it announced a string of exclusive games for the Xbox console. Sony unveiled in-depth trailers for some of its upcoming blockbuster PlayStation titles at E3, the biggest gaming conference in the world, as it looks to continue its dominance of the console market.One trailer that got the most attention was ""The Last of Us Part II"" which showed two women kissing then transitioning seamlessly into the title character Ellie cutting a person's throat. ""The Last of Us Part II"" is the sequel to the original game from the PlayStation 3 generation which won praise from fans and critics. No launch date was given for the game during the press conference on Monday. E3 is used by games companies to make big announcements, but Sony did not reveal anything new. Instead the Japanese technology giant used the show to highlight closer looks at previously announced games for the PlayStation 4, its latest generation of console.Other major titles that were highlighted included a new ""Spider-Man"" game and highly-anticipated titles ""Death Stranding"" and ""Ghost of Tsushima."" Sony's press conference came a day after Microsoft's, where it announced a string of exclusive games for the Xbox console and the acquisition of content studios to help make more first-party games. Exclusive and first-party games are crucial for console makers to differentiate from the competition and since the launch of the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's rival Xbox One X, Sony has been stronger in this area.It has helped the Japanese firm sell 76.6 million PS4s versus Microsoft 's Xbox One which has sold 39.1 million. Sony already has a strong pipeline of games in the works and current titles on the market, and analysts said it didn't need to announce many new products because of the advantage it already has.""I think the current roster of games that Sony has in terms of exclusives and first party is already so good. I wasn't expecting Sony to drop even more bombs this week,"" Serkan Toto, CEO of video games consultancy Kantan Games, told CNBC by phone on Tuesday. ""For Microsoft it is good for them, they are acquiring studios, they seem to have strong exclusive games in the pipeline, but for this console generation it is too little too late.""  "
221,2018-06-11T15:14:57-0400," Microsoft has previously deployed customizable chips in its servers for Azure, but customers can't directly tinker with them. Google is now on the third generation of its artificial intelligence chip. Microsoft is following Google's lead in designing a computer processor for artificial intelligence, according to recent job postings.In late March, Microsoft published at least three job openings within its Azure public cloud division, looking for candidates to work on features for an AI chip. The following month the team listed an opening for a silicon program manager, and ""an engineer for software/hardware codesign and optimization for AI acceleration.""Under the leadership of CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft is showing it's willing to spend the money it takes to have a full-featured cloud as it competes with Amazon Web Services and Google. Specialized processors are one way Microsoft can prove it's serious about bulking up its AI services for businesses within its cloud.Google, which trails AWS and Microsoft in the cloud market, first promoted the idea of a custom chip for AI in the cloud. The company is now on the third iteration of its tensor processing unit (TPU), an alternative to Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU), which has become the early industry standard for performing AI workloads.TPUs and GPUs can be used for training artificial neural networks, which can analyze large amounts of data, such as photos, and learn to recognize patterns. After being trained, they can make predictions based on what they know, helping computers recognize different people or pick up on the presence of certain objects. In a memo to employees in March, Nadella mentioned AI 18 times. But that's mostly futuristic. The public cloud is one of the main businesses driving growth today, and Microsoft announced last week that it's spending $7.5 billion on GitHub, adding a popular collaboration tool for developers.Semiconductors aren't entirely new for Microsoft. The company has taken steps to supercharge AI computing in its cloud with field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chips, with something called Project Brainwave. Today, those chips are available for training and running AI models with Azure's ready-to-use machine learning software. And last year Microsoft said it was building a custom AI chip for the next version of its HoloLens mixed reality headset — though that's outside of its cloud unit.The new job openings are not part of the FPGA program, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC, but are related to the work the company does in designing its own cloud hardware, an initiative called Project Olympus.""That group has been working on server design, silicon and AI to enable cloud workloads for some time,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. Jason Zander, executive vice president for Azure, referenced that work in an interview last month with CNBC's Jon Fortt. ""We actually design a lot of our own silicon that goes into the data centers,"" Zander said. At the same time, Microsoft uses silicon from Intel and Nvidia in Azure. Since Google first unveiled the TPU, Alibaba and Apple have said they're working on custom chips for AI. Some start-ups are also building new processors.It's a costly endeavor. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, estimates that Google has spent $200 million to $300 million on its TPU project. Microsoft has shown its willingness to spend, reporting a record $3.5 billion in capital expenditures last quarter.In an April interview with CNBC, Doug Burger, a Microsoft technical fellow who has led the FPGA work, was asked if the company is working on an AI server chip. He declined to say.""If ... you want to pick the economically rational decision, of course you're going to look at the various options,"" Burger said. ""We do the model and we say, 'What's the right thing for us?'"""
222,2018-06-11T05:10:24-0400," Microsoft unveiled a string of exclusive games such as ""Halo Infinite"", ""Forza Horizon 4"" and ""Gears 5"" at the E3 conference on Sunday. Microsoft announced the acquisition of of U.K.-based Playground Games. Analysts said the focus on more first party content will help Microsoft's gaming unit in the future as it competes with Sony's PlayStation 4.  Microsoft unveiled a string of exclusive games for the Xbox console and the acquisition of four content studios, as it tries to regain lost ground against the Sony PlayStation.On Sunday at E3, the biggest gaming event of the year, the U.S. technology giant showcased 52 games, 18 of which will launch as exclusives, meaning they will not be available on rival consoles. Exclusives are crucial for consoles to differentiate their offering from rivals and Microsoft in the past has been criticized for not having enough. It teased a game called ""Halo Infinite"" without giving a timeline for release. The first ""Halo"" game was released in 2001 and was a key reason for the success of the original Xbox. Other key exclusives include racing video game ""Forza Horizon 4"" and ""Gears 5.""Microsoft also announced further investment in original games. It said that it was forming a new studio called ""The Initiative"" and announced the acquisition of U.K.-based Playground Games, the developer behind the ""Forza"" franchise. Microsoft also signed letters of intent to acquire another three game studios.Analysts said the focus on more first-party content will help Microsoft's gaming unit in the future.""It will take time to reap the rewards of this more expansion strategy, but puts Microsoft on a much stronger footing,"" Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at IHS Markit, said in a note Sunday.Microsoft's latest generation of console is the Xbox One which was originally released in 2013. The company refreshed the line up with the Xbox One X, a more powerful version of the device last year. Sony's PlayStation 4 was also released in 2013 and it too has recently brought out a souped up version of the console called the PS4 Pro. Since the release of the consoles, Sony has taken the lead. There were 39.1 million Xbox One consoles in the market versus 76.6 million PS4s at the end of March 2018, according to IHS Markit data. Sony has been able to consistently deliver blockbuster exclusive games that has helped boost its market share.Microsoft also announced plans to launch a game streaming service on Sunday. This would mean that users could select a game online and play it immediately without the need to buy a disc or download the title. Sony currently has its own streaming service called PlayStation Now for $19.99 a month. Harding-Rolls said the streaming service is likely ""a few years away from launch."" But Microsoft's strength in cloud computing should put it in a good position.""A number of publishers are showing renewed interest in cloud gaming and subscription business models. As the market shifts, Microsoft is strongly positioned due to its Azure capability,"" Harding-Rolls said.As the life cycle of a console continues to increase, Microsoft and Sony are relying more heavily on subscription based models. Microsoft has a $9.99 a month subscription service called Xbox Game Pass which gives users access to new games.  ""We've been thrilled to see the positive impact Xbox Game Pass is having on the gaming ecosystem, including increasing the number of titles gamers play nearly 40 percent and increasing gameplay hours by almost 20 percent,"" Mike Nichols, chief marketing officer for gaming at Microsoft, said in a press release on Sunday. Sony will hold its E3 press conference on Monday. "

226,2018-06-07T16:19:53-0400," Microsoft generates revenue in part by running ads in many of its products, like Bing, LinkedIn and Skype. Nat Friedman, who will take over GitHub after Microsoft closes the acquisition, said the code-sharing site SourceForge turned into a ""swamp"" chock full of ads after it was bought. Microsoft isn't looking to make money from GitHub by placing ads on the site for storing code, GitHub's next leader said on Thursday.The sentiment reflects Microsoft's broad intent to be careful not to cripple its latest acquisition and not alienate the site's tens of millions of users. In a question and answer conversation on Reddit, Nat Friedman, who will become the CEO of GitHub after Microsoft closes the $7.5 billion acquisition, was asked by a Reddit user if people should expect ads to appear on public repositories of code on GitHub.""No,"" Friedman replied flatly.But the idea does have some precedent. In his answer Friedman went on to point out that another website where people could download code, SourceForge, was overrun with ads when it was owned by DHI from 2012 to 2016.""Some historical context: when GitHub started, SourceForge was the dominant code hosting site on the internet,"" Friedman wrote. ""SourceForge was eventually owned by a media conglomerate, who heavily monetized the site through advertising. It became a swamp of banner ads and pop-ups and delayed downloads to expose users to more ads. GitHub's clean interface and developer-centric approach can be seen in part as a reaction against SourceForge. It's obviously been the right path.""During the time DHI owned SourceForge, it introduced a revenue-sharing program called DevShare. But the system proved to be controversial because it was thought to package ""adware"" in an installer for downloading software. When BIZX bought SourceForge, the new president of the site proclaimed that it had ""completely eliminated"" DevShare. But by then, GitHub was widely used for downloading free software.Microsoft certainly knows how to make money from advertising. It runs ads in products like Bing, LinkedIn, MSN, Outlook and Skype, and in the most recent quarter, Microsoft had $1.78 billion in search ad revenue. Friedman's comments around not advertising on GitHub is reflective of the general desire to keep GitHub operating without unnecessary interruptions.""Microsoft has learned some hard (expensive) lessons about this type of acquisition,"" Friedman told a different Reddit user. ""Acquisitions under the current Microsoft leadership have a good track record – Minecraft and LinkedIn are examples where Microsoft acquired a successful platform, provided the companies with the resources they needed to accelerate, then let them continue to operate independently. It's working well.""Friedman has first-hand experience with Microsoft acquisitions: He joined the giant when it bought his start-up, Xamarin, in 2016. Like GitHub, Xamarin made tools for software developers."

HR boss Kathleen Hogan said in an attached email that the company takes the decline in income satisfaction ""seriously.""  The compensation issue is important as Microsoft looks to expand through additional hiring and acquisitions. While Microsoft is spending billions on acquisitions, employees aren't seeing such generosity in their paychecks. According to an annual companywide survey, obtained by CNBC, Microsoft employees said they're less fairly paid in 2018 than they were in any of the past three years. When asked if ""total compensation (base pay, bonus, equity) is competitive compared to similar jobs at other companies,"" only 61 percent said it was, down from 65 percent in 2017 and 67 percent each of the two prior years.Additionally, just 62 percent of the employees agreed that ""people are rewarded according to their job performance,"" down from 63 percent last year and 64 percent in 2016. Those two questions received some of the lowest scores on the survey. The company said that 86 percent of Microsoft's employees participated.The results, shared by Chief People Officer Kathleen Hogan in April, are a further indication of the challenge that Microsoft and other tech companies face in hiring and retaining top talent. Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, is just a few miles from Amazon's home and isn't far from the Seattle offices of Google, Facebook and a growing number of start-ups.As Microsoft continues to expand, through additional hiring and big acquisitions like this week's $7.5 billion GitHub deal, income satisfaction could become a more critical issue inside the company.In the email alongside the survey results, Hogan said the company takes the issue ""seriously,"" and that it will work to ensure a more balanced pay structure. ""On compensation and benefits, we will continue to take a market-driven approach as we continue to invest, ensuring that our overall deal remains strong and differentiated,"" she wrote.A Microsoft spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.Microsoft hasn't yet disclosed its median employee salary, a new regulatory requirement, due to the timing of its fiscal year. According to Glassdoor's report from last year, Microsoft had a median total compensation of $144,000, which was 19th among U.S. based companies, ranking below Google, Facebook, and Amazon.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella was the 17th highest paid CEO in the U.S., with $20 million in salary in 2017, according to Equilar.Aside from income satisfaction, Microsoft's workforce responded positively to much of the survey.Some 93 percent of respondents said they ""felt proud to work for Microsoft,"" while 94 percent said their managers treat employees with ""respect and dignity."" When asked about work-life balance, 93 percent said they were given the necessary flexibility by their manager.Here are the full survey results:"

Microsoft has deployed a submarine-like data center into the waters off the coast of Orkney, a group of islands located off Scotland.The tech giant said Wednesday that it had sunk the 40-foot-long vessel from the European Marine Energy Center (EMEC), a research base focused on wave and tidal power.The aim is to improve internet speeds in areas that are close to the water, where infrastructure is often lacking. Things like video streaming and gaming, in particular, rely on stronger processing infrastructure to connect to the internet.""Almost half of the world's population lives near large bodies of water,"" Cindy Rose, Microsoft's U.K. chief executive, said in a  blog post Wednesday. ""Having data centers closer to billions of people using the internet will ensure faster and smoother web browsing, video streaming and gaming, while businesses can enjoy AI (artificial intelligence)-driven technologies.""The underwater data center was built by Microsoft's Natick, a project dedicated to making such environmentally-friendly facilities.Microsoft has been working on underwater data centers for a number of years. It launched a prototype in California back in 2015.The company's latest unit contains 12 racks of computers with a total of 864 servers. It will be powered by an underwater cable linked back to the EMEC in Orkney. Microsoft said it uses under a quarter of a megawatt when operating at full capacity.The tech giant said the unit can hold data and process information for up to five years without maintenance.The Orkney Islands are known for research and development of renewables.

He takes over for the developer platform's founder, Chris Wanstrath, who stepped down 10 months ago.Andreessen Horowitz invested $100 million in GitHub six years ago. General partner Peter Levine championed Microsoft's pick to run the platform, noting that Friedman's reputation as a software developer demonstrates Microsoft's commitment to maintaining GitHub's open-source spirit.""Nat Friedman will be a tremendous steward of this business. He is a developer-oriented person first,"" Levine told CNBC in an interview. ""There are 800 GitHub people who have done a great job getting the company to this point. The Microsoft team will certainly be able to capitalize on that momentum.""It's an important choice, he said, considering GitHub's standing in the programming world. ""The develop ecosystem in an organization is front and center as every company in the world turns into a software company. GitHub catalyzed this,"" Levine said. Microsoft has already integrated its Azure cloud services with GitHub, Nadella said, and will continue to integrate those services. He encouraged other cloud providers to integrate with open-source platforms, as well.

Microsoft has researchers working to determine how brain implants can augment a person's intelligence, one of the many ways the company is trying to make technology more accessible to people with various disabilities.It's a topic that CEO Satya Nadella was eager to discuss on Thursday at Microsoft's eighth Ability Summit in Redmond, Washington.""In my case, accessibility and accessibility technologies and universal design has given me a deep sense of meaning beyond anything that I just do at work, in terms of the satisfaction that I derive from the work that Microsoft broadly does,"" Nadella said, in conversation with Jenny Lay-Flurrie, the company's chief accessibility officer.Research, which Microsoft established as a formal group in 1991, remains a key part of the company's focus, even though it could take time for some projects to drive significant revenue. As of last June, 32 percent of Microsoft's 124,000 employees worked in product research and development. Nadella talked about brain technologies as an example of how Microsoft could empower different groups of people. He referred to Seeing AI, an app Microsoft developed that can help the blind understand what's in front of them. He also said the company is working to assist people with locked-in syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that only allows people to communicate by eye movement.""How do you give them a language, because of just basically the ability to detect brain activity,"" said Nadella, whose son Zain is blind and has cerebral palsy.Facebook said last year that it was looking at ways to connect brains to computers.

""They will lose their jobs if this administration revokes that authority.""Additionally, Smith said, the U.S. government could roll back the potential for certain people with science, technology, engineering or math degrees to work under H-1B visas.If that were to happen, Smith said, ""we could have thousands of people suddenly unable to work. And I just think this is terrible for the country, it's terrible for the tech sector and it is a tragedy for the individuals involved.""Microsoft could well take its political opposition to the courts, Smith said.""I think we need to be firm in our resolve to take whatever action we can,"" he said. ""That means using our voice, it means using our lawyers, it may mean standing behind our employees, and if necessary, giving them the ability to work in Canada instead of the United States."""
237,2018-05-29T13:41:28-0400," Microsoft's acquisition of GitHub and Salesforce's purchase of MuleSoft are contributing to rising prices and multiples. President Trump's tax cuts are giving businesses more money to spend on new software and acquisitions. Cloud software companies are putting up big numbers in earnings reports. Cloud stocks are flying in 2018.Microsoft's $7.5 billion acquisition of GitHub this week only speaks to a bigger theme. From Okta and Twilio, which have more than doubled this year, to Zuora, DocuSign, Smartsheet and Zscaler, which have soared since their recent public market debuts, tech investors are pouring money into emerging software developers at an unprecedented rate.It's a shift from the last couple years when so much of the investor capital that flowed into tech was concentrated in the mega-cap names: Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Facebook.More than 25 software-as-a-service companies (valued at over $1 billion), including Salesforce, Zendesk, New Relic, Atlassian and ServiceNow, are up at least 40 percent this year, well ahead of the S&amp;P 500 Technology Index's 14 percent gain.Multiples are rapidly increasing as well, suggesting that investors are getting more bullish on the sustainability of the business models. The 50 companies in the Bessemer Venture Partners Cloud Index now trade for an average of 7.8 times revenue over the next 12 months, up 27 percent from a forward sales multiple of 6.1 at the beginning of the year. The BVP index uses enterprise value to revenue.Not included in the index are Microsoft and Adobe, which have also experienced extended rallies and are trading near record highs after pushing their businesses from desktop software to the cloud. Even Cisco made a giant bet on cloud early last year, purchasing AppDynamics for $3.7 billion just as the application monitoring company was about to go public.Here's why so much money is flying into cloud companies.Subscriptions: The high-level trend that's exciting Wall Street is subscriptions. Unlike the old days of software, when big vendors like Oracle and SAP would charge millions of dollars for multi-year contracts upfront and then tack on maintenance fees, this new generation of companies sell cloud-based services, generating some money initially but getting much more over time as customers renew their deals and demand more features.""When you buy cloud or subscription software from a vendor, you can buy exactly how much you want: per person, per-employee, pay as you go,"" said Richard Davis, an analyst covering enterprise software at Canaccord Genuity. ""It is a good business model and demand is strong, because everyone wants to buy software to make their companies efficient.""M&amp;A potential: Investors also see big bucks from potential acquisitions.Microsoft just paid 25 times sales for GitHub, a privately held company that has a relatively small business today but is practically ubiquitous in the developer community. In April, Salesforce made its biggest purchase ever, agreeing to buy MuleSoft for $6.8 billion — that's more than 15 times trailing revenue, which was the most expensive cloud software deal in history for a publicly traded company, based on a multiple of revenue. Cisco's purchase of AppDynamics was also for more than 15 times trailing revenue.""You do have that multiple raise as a result of some of these larger deals,"" said James Fish, an analyst at Piper Jaffray who covers software, networking and storage. Shareholders are asking, ""If Cisco or Salesforce are willing to pay more than 10 times, why as an investor can't I increase my outlook, as well?"" he said.And the acquisition spree may just be getting started.""There is a lot of interest from large software vendors to consolidate pure-play cloud companies,"" said Steve Koenig, an analyst covering the software industry at Wedbush Securities. There have been some big deals, ""but there are more waiting to happen,"" he said.Koenig said that cloud companies are also benefiting from a more favorable tax environment, following President Trump's corporate tax cut, which gave businesses more money to spend on new software and IT systems as well as on acquisitions.Earnings show real customer demand:  Most importantly, cloud companies are putting up numbers.In its first earnings report as a public company, Zuora beat analyst estimates and said that its customer retention rate, a key metric for subscription companies, reached 112 percent on a dollar basis. The stock jumped 19 percent the next day. Zuora's software helps businesses manage their subscription revenue.Smartsheet, a developer of workplace collaboration software, rose over 9 percent on Tuesday after topping estimates in its debut earnings report. Cloud security vendor Zscaler soared 26 percent on Thursday on surging revenue, billings and a 120 percent dollar-based retention rate. And DocuSign climbed more than 6 percent on Friday after reporting revenue that beat analyst expectations.Big market and solid economics: IDC projects that cloud services revenue will more than double to $276.8 billion by 2021 from $129.7 billion last year, as more large global enterprises push workloads to the cloud.  According to Piper Jaffray's annual CIO Survey, enterprise cloud software spending comes second only to security spending within IT budgets.SaaS vendors are valuable for more than just their recurring revenue models, Davis said. They also have lower overhead costs than on-premise software companies and require less customization for individual clients, keeping down development expenses.Davis said that companies like Adobe, Salesforce and Atlassian, a provider of developer tools, are showing they can grow 15 to 20 percent or more and reach free cash flow margins of 40 percent (a measure of profitability), which puts them in the ""top 1 percent of public companies.""There are some risks that could bring the cloud boom to an end.More competition from the giants: A lingering concern for many SaaS companies is uncertainty as to how far and wide the massive cloud platforms plan to go in their own offerings.Amazon Web Services, in particular, has stuck mostly to providing infrastructure and core computing services, rather than veering into applications. But since almost all of these vendors rely on some combination of AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google's cloud to host and power their data, there's always the risk that their partners could turn into rich and powerful competitors.For that most part, that hasn't happened yet.""Most software companies are seeing AWS, Azure and even Google, the major cloud platforms, as trends to be accepted and partnered with, as enablers of disruption,"" Koenig said. ""They want to partner with major cloud stocks, not compete against them.""Macro: Any downturn in U.S. stocks, which are in year 10 of a bull market, could punish many richly valued cloud companies that have never had to weather significant economic strain. On Thursday, a slightly down day for the broader market, a number of cloud companies, including Okta, ServiceNow, Atlassian and HubSpot, each fell at least 4 percent.But there's no turning away from the broader subscription model. It's a theme that Zuora CEO Tien Tzuo has been evangelizing since starting his company in 2008, after a long career at Salesforce. His company even has an annual conference called Subscribed, which took place this week in San Francisco, and he recently published a book under the same title.tweetCanaccord's Davis attended Subscribed and wrote up a report on June 5, based in part on a ""dozen conversations with random attendees.""""Importantly, the phrase 'subscription economy' is more than just a marketing jingle,"" Davis said. ""It is a fundamental change in the way leading businesses will thrive."""
238,2018-05-29T19:27:56-0400," Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief counsel, spoke about the company's antitrust case in the 1990s at the Code Conference on Tuesday. He said that every company needs to figure out when it's no longer a start-up and become more willing to compromise. Smith also said that if companies don't address the issues that people are concerned about, they'll face regulation. Tech history repeats itself, and nobody knows that better than Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief counsel.Smith was deeply involved in Microsoft's antitrust battle against the federal government in the 1990s, and remembers how resolved the company was to fight it.That turned out to be a mistake, Smith said at the Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, on Tuesday.""If we had worked things out in 1998, we might have been able to work them out before it became the antitrust version of nuclear war,"" Smith said. Instead, the federal government tried to break up the company, a ruling that was eventually overturned on appeal.Smith sees parallels at Facebook, which has come under recent scrutiny from the government over issues like Russian operatives using the platform to try and influence the 2016 presidential election and the Cambridge Analytica data leak. The trouble, according to Smith, is that every start-up is fighting against incredible odds when it starts out. To survive, executives need a strong competitive instinct. But, he said, ""there comes a moment in time you're not a start-up anymore,"" and at that point, it actually ""takes more courage"" to compromise than to keep fighting.Smith said the biggest problem with Microsoft's decision to fight was the distraction it created for top executives like Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. As a result, ""we missed search"" and many other business areas, allowing competitors like Google, Apple, and Amazon to get huge head starts.Smith said Microsoft wouldn't have caught every new innovation, but ""the odds of seeing these things would have been higher.""Smith did offer some praise for Mark Zuckerberg, who wasn't as combative in his appearance before Congress as Microsoft execs were in the 1990s. In particular, Zuckerberg at least admitted that there might be a problem and that the tech industry might need more regulation.""One of the things Mark Zuckerberg did well when he testified was to say, 'We understand regulation may be in order.'""According to Smith, the tech industry has to address people's concerns about privacy and power, or else regulation is likely.""Radio has been regulated, television has been regulated, the one area that has not been regulated is the internet,"" he said."
239,2018-05-29T14:45:05-0400," Microsoft is now worth $749 billion and is the world's third most valuable company. In March, Microsoft's Windows organization was split up. When Google first passed Microsoft in terms of stock market value six years ago, it looked like the companies were headed in opposite directions.But over the past 12 months, Microsoft has surged 40 percent, more than five times Alphabet's gain, and has again become the more valuable of the two. As of Tuesday's close, Microsoft was worth $749 billion and Alphabet's market capitalization stood at $739 billion.Microsoft's latest rally has been sparked by growth in its cloud computing business, which is bigger than Google's though it still trails Amazon Web Services. In March, Microsoft reorganized its Windows and Devices Group and moved its engineering resources into other units, including one focusing on cloud and artificial intelligence.Both Microsoft and Alphabet beat analysts' expectations in the first quarter.Google went public in 2004 and spent the next eight years closing the gap with Microsoft, which debuted on the stock market in 1986. Even after Google first passed Microsoft in 2012, the companies flip-flopped several times over the next few years.But Google, which created Alphabet as its parent company in 2015, took a commanding lead that year and held onto it until this month. Microsoft is now the world's third most valuable publicly traded company, behind Apple and Amazon. Alphabet is fourth, followed by Facebook and China's Tencent. On Tuesday, Microsoft fell 0.4 percent to $98.01, while Alphabet's Class A shares dropped 1.5 percent to $1,068.07. "

Microsoft says the deal means it could combine Semantic's technology with its own AI efforts. Microsoft has bought Semantic Machines, an artificial intelligence start-up, as it looks to boost its efforts in developing conversational AI.Berkeley, California-based Semantic's approach to AI is using machine learning to add context to conversations with chatbots. This means taking information received by AI and applying it to future dialogue.The firm's speech recognition team previously led automatic speech recognition development for Apple's personal assistant Siri.In its announcement Monday, Microsoft did not disclose any financial details of the acquisition.Big players are trying to make their personal assistants more human-like. Amazon has said it is aiming to give Alexa a ""memory"" and add more context to conversations, while Google demonstrated a chat between a hairdresser and a human-like version of its assistant that booked an appointment on behalf of someone else.""With the acquisition of Semantic Machines, we will establish a conversational AI center of excellence in Berkeley to push forward the boundaries of what is possible in language interfaces,"" David Ku, chief technology officer at Microsoft AI and Research, said in a  blog post.""Combining Semantic Machines' technology with Microsoft's own AI advances, we aim to deliver powerful, natural and more productive user experiences that will take conversational computing to a new level.""AI-powered personal assistants are core to voice-activated speakers like Amazon's Echo and Google's Home.

241,2018-05-18T13:50:58-0400," Qi Lu was hired at Baidu to take over daily operations from CEO Robin Li in early 2017. Prior to that he was an executive vice president of Microsoft, where he was in charge of Office. In a statement from China-based Baidu, Lu said he can no longer work full-time in China. Baidu on Friday said its operating chief, former Microsoft executive Qi Lu, will be stepping down in July, less than two years into his tenure there. Baidu stock was down more than 9 percent after the announcement.The move is a loss for one of China's leading tech companies, which are racing like American technology companies to enhance services with artificial intelligence. Baidu hired Lu to take on day-to-day operations on behalf of CEO Robin Li in January 2017. Immediately prior to that, he was an executive vice president at Microsoft, where he was in charge of Office applications. Earlier in his career he worked at IBM and Yahoo. Office is now a key part of Microsoft's growing Commercial Cloud. ""We have seen many positive changes at Baidu since Qi joined last year. I'm especially impressed by Qi's integrity, dedication to work and sharp insights into technologies and businesses,"" Li said in a statement on the news. Lu said in the statement that he can no longer work full-time in China for ""personal and family reasons"" and will spend more time in the U.S. He will retain his role as vice president of Baidu's board and will focus on research and development, although he won't be working full-time for Baidu.""I'm honored to have participated in Baidu's transition into an AI-first company,"" Lu said. Microsoft and Google, among others, have also sought to reshape themselves around AI. Lu, who has more than 40  U.S. patents, left Microsoft in 2016 for health reasons following a bicycle accident."

He likened the current market conditions to the tech bubble of the early 2000s.""Remember the tech bubble popped, there was this return-to-normal rally from late December [2000] through January of 2001, and then it was downhill from there"" and stocks did not return to those ""crazy valuations,"" Yusko said on ""Power Lunch."" ""And I think we've got the same playing out here: the tech bubble 2.0 popped"" in the final three months of 2018 with the broader market.Yusko said tech giants like Cisco, Microsoft, Intel and Qualcomm were overvalued during the first tech bubble in the mid-to-late 1990s and have yet to recover those values. He criticized current tech leaders like Netflix and Amazon that have sky-high earnings multiples.After Yusko's October call, the S&amp;P 500 fell about 13 percent to a 2018 closing low on Christmas Eve of 2,351. But his prediction of a further fall didn't happen. The index since Dec. 24 has recovered nearly all its losses due to a strong January start on Wall Street. For the S&amp;P 500 to drop nearly 50 percent since Oct. 11, it would have to get to a level around 1,364.""We don't have to get to fair value, but the way math works for every day you're above average you've gotta spend a day below average,"" Yusko said.The S&amp;P 500 traded 0.2 percent higher on Wednesday, closing at 2,638.7 after breaking a four-session winning streak Tuesday."

244,2018-05-16T08:59:25-0400," The new $400 tablets will feature 10-inch screens and rounded edges — closely mimicking the iPad — and could hit shelves as early as the second half of 2018, according to a Bloomberg report.  Microsoft attempted to launch an affordable Surface-branded laptop in 2012 with the release of the Surface RT. Microsoft is preparing to take on Apple's iPad with a line of low-cost tablets, according to a Bloomberg report. The new $400 tablets will feature 10-inch screens and rounded edges — closely mimicking the iPad — and could hit shelves as early as the second half of 2018, the news site said, citing anonymous sources. Microsoft attempted to launch an affordable Surface-branded laptop in 2012 with the release of the Surface RT. It ran on Microsoft's less-powerful Windows RT operating system, however, and failed to gain traction due to a lack of apps.Bloomberg said Microsoft would use an Intel processor this time — the Surface RT used a chip from Nvidia — to allow it to run more applications.Microsoft may need to make sacrifices in other areas to keep the price down. Displays are commonly one of the more expensive components, so while it has adopted sharper screens for its standard line of Surface laptops, the screens in the more affordable models might not be as good. Apple has left some room for another major player in low-cost tablets — the company's iPad revenue has declined every year since 2013.Microsoft did not immediately return a request for comment from CNBC. Read the full Bloomberg report here."
245,2018-05-16T10:35:51-0400," Microsoft is reportedly planning a new Surface to rival the iPad. It needs to get a few things right, and it can't repeat past mistakes. Microsoft needs to nail the price, offer a full range of apps, include accessories and more. Microsoft is building a cheaper Surface tablet to compete against Apple's iPad, according to Bloomberg. Microsoft has tried this before — but failed. Here's what it needs to do to succeed.Microsoft's Surface tablets, which run a full version of Windows, are excellent computers. They're also very expensive. The Surface Pro starts at $799 and that doesn't include a keyboard. Conversely, Apple's new iPad starts at $329. Microsoft is targeting the $400 price point, according to Bloomberg, but it should try to come in closer to Apple's starting price or add value by including a keyboard and a stylus.Microsoft's most recent attempt at an affordable tablet was in 2012, when it launched the Surface RT. That laptop-tablet hybrid failed largely because it ran a watered-down version of Windows called Windows RT. Consumers couldn't download the apps they were accustomed to using while running on Windows. Microsoft needs to make sure its customers can run the Windows app they're familiar with.This is a tricky one for Microsoft. Apple sells several versions of iPads, including those equipped with just Wi-Fi and those that also offer Wi-Fi and cellular connections that let you access the internet anywhere Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Sprint have a signal.Microsoft has a version of Windows for tablets that runs on Qualcomm chips and are always connected like iPads, but those tablets don't have access to as many apps as those that run on Intel chips. It should use Intel chips so customers can get all of their apps, and include a full version of Windows, but also use Qualcomm modems to provide cellular connectivity —  as it did with the Surface Pro LTE.Apple's offering for its iPad with Wi-Fi and cellular starts at $459, so Microsoft needs to hit that price point, too.Microsoft shouldn't skimp on features, either. An affordable Surface won't just compete with the iPad at a $400 price point, but also Google's Chromebooks. If it wants these computers to be just as useful for work as they are for entertainment, it should make sure they support the Surface Pen for drawing on the screen and taking notes, as well as a full keyboard for allowing the tablet to work a full-fledged computer. As I said in the first point, Microsoft can help undercut the iPad by including a keyboard and pencil with the bundle.Microsoft has a chance to succeed here. I'm a big fan of the Surface computers it sells, especially because they let me access all of the apps I need for work and multitask better than an iPad. Microsoft needs to show people why they shouldn't buy an iPad, however, which is arguably the best all-around tablet for most people. That's going to come down to pricing, connectivity and apps."
246,2018-05-12T09:17:38-0400," Microsoft's AI demonstrations were more business-centric than Google's. The chief scientist of Salesforce said he was impressed with how Google squeezed many AI technologies into the demonstration of the Duplex robot calling technology. Google revealed a vision for artificial intelligence that was simultaneously exciting and controversial at its developer confab on Tuesday. The Google Assistant called a hair salon to make an appointment and then called a restaurant to find out about table availability. The performances did more than steal the show. They also overshadowed everything Microsoft announced about AI at its own conference this week.""Google reaffirmed its leadership position in AI,"" as Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell put it in a Wednesday note. Cordwell's note made no mention of Microsoft.Media outlets were quick to point out that Google did not disclose to people on the other end of the calls that the caller was a computer program, not a person, even though it did sound surprisingly natural. The underlying issue? People might not treat automated calls in the same way that they would human ones. Two days after the presentation, Google, which plans to test the technology this summer, clarified that it will make sure to let people know whenever it's the Asssitant calling and not an actual person.Microsoft's most imaginative example of AI this week involved its Cortana assistant greeting people by name as they sat down at a meeting, transcribing what they said and highlighting action items. The system didn't get every word right, but other than that, it received hardly any criticism in comparison with the Google calling feature, which goes by the name Duplex.Both exhibitions are backed up by long-term investments. Researchers at Google and its sister company DeepMind, both under parent Alphabet, are constantly publishing academic papers describing their latest experiments. Microsoft, with its vast longstanding research arm, is also regularly putting out papers. Both Google and Microsoft announced progress in their efforts to provision more powerful chips for AI. (But only Microsoft is keen to see its chip architecture adopted in other companies' facilities.)Google and Microsoft do business in some of the same markets that cross consumer and enterprise -- search, desktop operating system, productivity tools. But when it comes to demonstrating how people can use AI in 2018, the companies have a discernible distinction. Microsoft is emphasizing business uses, while Google is working to enhance services for mainstream audiences.And that makes sense, as Microsoft is increasingly chasing business subscriptions to cloud-based Office apps and corporate uses of its Azure cloud, while Google continues to get most of its money through online tools for the broad public.The difference in focus was manifested throughout the companies' dueling keynotes.Microsoft showed how a drone made smart with AI can recognize anomalies in pipes as it flies above them. It said that the Visual Studio app for writing code will provide AI-powered suggestions, and that Cortana will help plan meetings and surface relevant documents in the Microsoft Teams chat app. Cortana also chimed in with helpful information as one person was typing out a business document in Word.A Microsoft executive gave people a look at new AI-fueled grammar-checking capabilities in Word, too. It stood out as one of the few instances this week of Microsoft announcing an intent to deliver AI that anyone can use in whatever way they like -- but then again, Microsoft was showing it off as an example of what third-party developers can do when they use the company's underlying technology for adding AI to Windows apps. KeyBanc analysts led by Brent Bracelin said in a Wednesday note that they walked away from developer sessions at Microsoft's Build conference convinced that Microsoft ""has ambitious plans to integrate AI and [machine learning] functionality in a pervasive manner across the entire application portfolio.""Google countered Microsoft's event with demonstrations of AI bubbling up personalized recommendations of places in Google Maps and articles in Google News. Google also announced Gmail is getting a feature to help you write emails and said DeepMind found ways to make batteries in Android devices last longer.But days later, Google's Duplex calling technology was the one thing people kept talking about. tweetRichard Socher, chief scientist at Salesforce, told CNBC that it was impressive how Google was able to pull together multiple AI efforts into one demonstration. It was a glimpse of the future of AI in the real world, even though it ties together several research innovations that have emerged in recent years, he said.""In the next two to five [years] I can very well see this becoming much more prevalent,"" Socher said, adding that he's personally keen to bring similar technologies to big businesses."
247,2019-01-21T19:16:00-0500,"(Recasts after dinner, adds Macron quotes)VERSAILLES, France, Jan 21 (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron told dozens of the world's most powerful executives on Monday that he would not follow the path of guillotined French royals and would continue to reform the French economy despite a sometimes violent popular revolt.For the second year running, Macron hosted corporate A-listers like Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella, Snapchat's Evan Spiegel and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co CEO Jamie Dimon at a pre-Davos dinner at Versailles.Exactly 226 years after the decapitation of Louis XVI, who failed to plug the crown's dismal finances and quell popular discontent over a sclerotic feudal society, Macron started his speech by invoking the king and his wife Marie-Antoinette.""If they met such an end, it is because they had given up on reforming,"" Macron told the guests, according to his office.His office said earlier that foreign companies including medical products company Microport, Mars, Procter &amp; Gamble, Cisco and others would announce investments in France totalling more than 600 million euros.The dinner was an opportunity to reassure investors of Macron's resolve to reform the economy after images of protesters angry at his policies attacking public monuments, boutiques, banks and riot police were beamed around the world.""There are questions about the protests' magnitude, about the violence, because these images are shocking for foreigners,"" a source at Macron's office said before the summit.""Last year, the summit was in a totally different dynamic, it was all about 'France is back'. Here we're in a tougher part of the mandate domestically and that requires more explanations,"" the source added.On Monday, Macron told the business leaders the ""yellow vest"" movement was part of a bigger picture of middle-class angst over globalisation that gave rise to Brexit in Britain, as well as the rise of populist parties in Germany or Italy.""The solution to the crisis is not to roll back what we have done in the past 18 months,"" he said.Macron was elected in May 2017 against a far-right candidate on a promise to create jobs and drive growth by cutting corporate taxes, easing France's rigid labour regulations, and developing a more skilled labour force.He began making good on those campaign pledges in a reform blitz during the first 18 months of his presidency that has impressed investors but infuriated low-paid workers, who feel he favours big business and is indifferent to their struggle to make ends meet.Over the past two months, that popular anger has been vented at protests across France. The unrest has convulsed Macron and his government and forced costly concessions.Macron is not attending the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, his office says, so that he can deal with quelling the yellow vest uprising.Below are some of the key investment pledges announced on Monday:* Microport: 350 million euros over five years to expand a Research &amp; Development centre.* Mars: 120 million euros invested in eight different sites including the Haguenau plant where M&amp;Ms are produced.* Procter &amp; Gamble: 50 million euro investment in a new detergent production line at its Amiens plant.* Transpod: 20 million euro investment to finance a 3-km (1.9-mile) hyperloop test line.

""It is wild that just because you get misinformation, thinking you're protecting your kid, you're actually putting your kid at risk, as well as all the other kids around them.""Using measles as an example of a once-dangerous disease that's easily preventable by a vaccine, Gates warned against complacency.""As you get a disease down to small numbers, people forget.

250,2018-05-08T09:19:57-0400,"  Microsoft will attempt to buy Netflix, Media Tech Capital Partners' Porter Bibb predicts. But he didn't give a timetable. Bibb says Microsoft wants to get into streaming content but lacks the TV and movie content that Netflix offers. Microsoft will attempt to buy Netflix in an effort to crack into the streaming business, veteran media analyst Porter Bibb predicted Tuesday.Bibb, a tech and media analyst with more than 40 years experience on Wall Street, did not offer a timeline for when he thought Microsoft could go after Netflix's assets. But, he said, the technology giant lacks media content and wants to get into streaming content.""They're moving as fast they can into the cloud business. They don't have any direct to the consumer content delivery,"" the managing partner at Media Tech Capital Partners told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""I think Netflix is going to be acquired by Microsoft, which doesn't have any content right now.""Netflix, with a market value of nearly $142 billion, has seen its shares soar more than 100 percent during the past 12 months. It might seem like a strange takeover target for Microsoft. But market watchers including CNBC's Jim Cramer have previously noted that Microsoft's deep pockets could allow Netflix to keep writing large paychecks to Hollywood television and movie studios for content.Netflix said in its latest quarterly report it expects to have $7.5 billion to $8 billion in content expenses this year, in line with previous estimates.Microsoft, with a market value of $739 billion, has seen its stock rise late last month after it posted a quarterly profit that topped Wall Street forecasts, fueled by its cloud computing business, which competes with the cloud infrastructure offering Amazon Web Services. Microsoft shares have gained nearly 40 percent in the past 12 months.Microsoft and Netflix did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.Bibb's prediction on Microsoft and Netflix comes on the heels another major media merger plan — Walt Disney's deal to acquire most of Twenty-First Century Fox's assets. Sources tell CNBC that Comcast is making preparations for a possible all-cash bid for Twenty-First Century Fox's entertainment assets, but only if the government approves AT&amp;T's bid to buy Time Warner.However, Bibb said that a Comcast/Twenty-First Century Fox deal may not happen because media mogul Rupert Murdoch wants to tie his Fox legacy to Disney. Murdoch ""doesn't want all that cash,"" Bibb said.— Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of NBCUniversal, parent company of CNBC and CNBC.com. "
251,2018-05-07T17:24:50-0400," Microsoft executives showed Cortana working in Word and demonstrated how people will be able to reach Alexa from Cortana. The company also showed how artificial intelligence can be used in drones. But Microsoft did not announce a product to rival Amazon's Alexa for Business, which was introduced in November.  At its big conference for developers on Monday, Microsoft executives were showing what it will be like to live in a world infused with artificial intelligence.Cortana, the company's digital assistant and its rival to Amazon Alexa and Apple's Siri, is at the heart of Microsoft's effort to embed voice and image recognition into more of its services. Microsoft representatives demonstrated how artificial intelligence could help drones spot anomalies they see from above and recognize the people who come into a conference room for a meeting, speedily transcribing what they say.Four years into his gig running Microsoft — and after initially proclaiming that the world is primarily mobile-first and cloud-first — CEO Satya Nadella is focused on expanding the powers of Cortana, which is embedded into Windows 10 and has nearly 150 million people using it every month.But there are limitations, and among them is Alexa's popularity in the home through the Amazon Echo. Recognizing that Microsoft won't be supplanting Amazon, Nadella knows that people who use Cortana for core Microsoft services like email and scheduling need to be able to communicate using their home Echo devices.""We want to make it possible for our customers to be able to get the most out of their personal digital assistants, not to be bound to some single walled garden,"" Nadella said, at the Build developer conference in Seattle, as the company demonstrated how consumers will be able to reach Cortana through Alexa, and vice-versa.While Microsoft is highlighting the many ways Cortana can be used in the office, the company has yet to introduce a workplace-specific service, even though it could potentially be a way to pick up AI revenue from customers with tens of thousands of employees. It's yet another way that Amazon is out in front — in November, the company announced Alexa for Business, integrating AI into more of its enterprise services.The competition doesn't end there. Apple, Facebook and Google have also been weaving AI into their business products, with varying degrees of success making money from them. If anything, Build is showing just how much Microsoft has to do to catch up.In AI research, Google's parent Alphabet is generally viewed as the corporate leader. Last year Alphabet's DeepMind stunned the field when a computer system it built beat the world's top-ranked player of the Chinese board game Go.And in the public cloud business, Amazon has a commanding lead, with 33 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, compared with 13 percent for Microsoft, according to Synergy Research Group.Microsoft still has a big advantage, in that it's been serving large enterprises with Windows, Office and data center software for decades. That customer base could be the key opportunity for building an AI business, just as it should enable Azure to win contracts from companies migrating to the cloud.Microsoft also has some momentum with Cortana. Last year the company began a public preview of the Cortana Skills Kit — mirroring Amazon's Alexa Skills Kit — where developers could build extensions for the assistant. There were 230 Cortana skills as of December.On Monday, Microsoft showed a few new uses of Cortana in its own apps. Users of Word can have Cortana helpfully chime in and provide information that's relevant to what they type. And in the Teams chat app that competes with Slack, Cortana can detect that a group of people needs to meet, and will intelligently suggest times when everyone will be free.Nadella is trying to show the world that Microsoft can both innovate with cutting-edge services and still be the trusted provider that's helped protect their sensitive data. While other tech companies are reasonably new to the enterprise and have traditional businesses that involve collecting vast amounts of consumer data, Microsoft is an enterprise software company. And nowhere is that more important than with AI.Nadella said on Monday that companies need ""privacy-preserving AI, or private AI."""
252,2018-05-07T11:32:18-0400,"CNBC's Jon Fortt sat down with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in advance of the company's annual Build conference.The tech company reported higher than expected third-quarter earnings last month with strong guidance for the upcoming fiscal year.Microsoft plans to continue driving revenue growth through its cloud services. Its Intelligent Cloud segment contains the Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services.Nadella discussed the future of Microsoft and its cloud service, rivals Google and Amazon, artificial intelligence, and what to expect at this year's Build.Read the full transcript here.Jon Fortt: Great. I think it's been seven years or so since we first sat down. Satya Nadella: That's right. And I guess that was before I was CEO. That's right.Fortt: Yes, before you were CEO. We go way back, you know.Nadella: That's right.Fortt: And you're famous now.Nadella: What happened?Fortt: You wrote a book. I think I saw you in Better Homes and Gardens even. [EDITOR'S NOTE: Nadella appeared in Good Housekeeping, not Better Homes and Gardens.]Nadella: That's right.Fortt: I've never seen, that I can recall, an executive go from ""Who's he?"" to now, ""This guy knows what's going on, and he is at the center of the zeitgeist,"" quite the way I've seen you do it. Is it weird? Nadella: If you say so. I don't find any difference, but it's been a fantastic ride. I think what's been humbling for me is — I don't get confused — this is all because of the platform I've been given, which is Microsoft and the work we do. It's not me, but it's the opportunity I've been given.Fortt: At what point do you say, and I know this isn't a turnaround, this is hitting refresh, and there's still work to do — as you said in the book — but Microsoft's stock is near all-time highs, in the mid 90s, recently. At what point can you say, ""Yeah, we've got that part behind us. The turnaround, or the refresh, or whatever you want to call it, there's still more to do, but yeah, good job, team. Now it's time to take the next hill.""Nadella: I mean, I think that's the fundamental posture that we have to have. And quite frankly, any company that needs to continue to renew itself needs to have. Because if you think about it, what's going to happen next, and the day after, is what you have to anticipate. So what has happened in the past is just the past.Fortt: Is Phase One done? Can you kind of say, ""Hey, I've been CEO for four-ish years now, and yeah, we got that part done, pretty good job.""Nadella: Yeah I think to me it is very important to start with two things — a very clear sense of purpose and identity, and a clear understanding of how to express that sense of purpose and identity in a changing world. I feel like in the the last four and a half years, we were able to do a good job of that.But I tell you, I only think of what are we going to do next. Because that sense of purpose will have to remain constant. And our culture that allows us to move forward has to remain constant. But there's going to be a lot of churn about how the world's going to change, and we will have to change with it and, in fact, ahead of it.Fortt: Speaking of a sense of purpose, you said something interesting recently, you said, ""That's what I want my legacy to be, that anyone who joins our company is able to connect their personal passion, and use Microsoft as a platform to realize it."" What's your personal passion?Nadella: That's a great question. In fact the way I got to this was I used to work for a gentleman by the name of Doug Burgum, who is actually the governor of North Dakota now. He had said this to me, I was probably in my mid-30s, he says, ""Wow, we spend far too much time at work for it not to have meaning.""And that's when I said, ""Why am I at Microsoft? What is it that gives me the energy at Microsoft, day in and day after?"" And it is mostly because of the platform it creates for me, to be able to connect with what I'm passionate about. Take accessibility. It's something that I personally am super passionate about. But Microsoft's given me an amazing opportunity to be able to take that passion, connect it to real work and see its impact in the world. And I think that's true for 100,000 people here. It's the local communities, the countries we work in, the sectors of the economy, education, health. That broad spectrum impact that Microsoft has is the opportunity that it creates for every one of our employees. But what defines me, I think, is curiosity, love of ideas and the ability to translate that into impact.Fortt: Some of what you just shared about accessibility is a good segue way into Build and some of the announcements that you're making at the Developer Conference. I was looking at what you said four years ago, when we sat down here, in Redmond, about why Microsoft is leading with mobile and cloud. And it sounds exactly right in terms of what is important in the space. Do the same for me, if you will, with artificial intelligence. What are the necessary ingredients for a company to excel in AI and be a mega-scale player? How many mega-scale players are there going to be, and why is it essential?Nadella: First of all, the world that we are entering and, in fact, we're in the midst of this massive transformation, is what I describe as an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge. I mean, think about it, the computing fabric is getting more distributed and more ubiquitous. You have now more computing power. Take GPU power in a car, [there's more] than perhaps even in a data center a few years ago. You have a microcontroller with this Azure Sphere that we just recently announced. Every microcontroller out there, in your fridge, in any drill, is going to have compute power. Every factory is going to have millions and millions of sensors.Fortt: Your neighbor Amazon is buying intelligent doorbells, video cameras recognizing faces…Nadella: That's right. In fact, one of the announcements at Build is going to be a Qualcomm camera that's capable of running an image classified in a container. So that means in the wild, you could start recognizing objects, or a DJI drone.In fact, that's going to be capable of running the Azure Edge so that you can detect any faults in an oil pipeline. So computing is becoming ubiquitous. And that means data is getting generated in large amounts. Once you have that, then what you do is, you do AI on it, which is your reason over large amounts of data, using all this computer power to give yourself, in whatever app, in whatever field, that predictive power, that analytical power, that capability to automate things.Fortt: So do you have to be a mega-scale player in either cloud infrastructure or in data, to really be able to play in that then?Nadella: I think that in our business, there is absolutely scale. If you think about Azure, we have 50 data centers, more than anybody else in terms of data center regions. We also have the capability of putting Azure Stack wherever you want it. If you have the ability to even embed things like Azure Sphere. So yes, you have to have to have some scale around the capability, whether it's the AI capability or the cloud capability. I sort of view it as this next phase is not about celebrating just the mega-scale players, it's who can really translate their scale into mass impact, where every business is becoming an AI business.Because I feel like we're in this phase still of celebrating AI breakthrough. I do that myself, too. If you think about it, Microsoft, I'm so proud of our achievements in human patterning speech or object recognition, or machine greeting and comprehension. These are big breakthroughs. But to me, what is going to define our business success is going to be our ability to translate that into a set of platforms and tools that are actually commoditized.Fortt: Commoditized?Nadella: That means it should be possible for any developer out there in any company, at Maersk, at Bühler, any of the companies we work with, to be able to become an AI developer. Fortt: OK.Nadella: Because unless and until we achieve that, at least for Microsoft's business model, and our identity, just saying I have speech recognition that's world-record-breaking is no good. I've got to give it to Xiaomi, so that they can, for every Chinese traveler, build a machine translation device, or a speech translation device. That's breakthrough, and that's what we're focused on.Fortt: So at another developer conference back in the fall, Amazon's, they also were unveiling some AI related tools … Are we going to end up with these developer tools around artificial intelligence with walled gardens?Nadella: In fact, if you look at Amazon and us, if there's one real common ground we have between us is that we believe in our personal digital assistants, whether it's Alexa and Cortana, in fact, working with each other. This is speaking to your walled gardens point, which is, I think that sometimes walled garden strategies can work for some of the time, but not all of the time. I think at least in our case, when it comes to Azure, we are building it out as an open ecosystem. A distributed ecosystem that addresses the world's needs, and we'll have strong competition.In some sense, there will be some scale players that will always be competing. I'm not a believer in all these winner-take-all type of dynamics. I feel like you have to sort of compete each day to make progress.Fortt: I want to talk to you about data ethics, because I know that's something that's going to be a theme at Build, as well. Have you considered rethinking Microsoft's business model around data? I mean, there's been this idea in the industry that in exchange for free services, you basically allow certain companies to follow you around digitally. Yes, you have the opportunity to opt out using certain browsers or certain browser settings but generally speaking, the trade-off is you get to use this for free, we get to follow and target. Is there the possibility that that bargain is not going to work anymore?Nadella: That is a great question. In fact, if anything, I feel at Microsoft we've done a lot to make sure that our business model is fundamentally aligned with our customers, and their preference. What I mean by that is we do have some ad-supported businesses but we have subscriptions.Whether it's for individuals, or for organizations. And the predominant business model at this company is all about making sure that the data, and any surplus that gets created out of data, like AI, is to benefit the user, not us. So we want to be a pure software company that, through subscriptions, helps every organization and every individual get more out of their data, more out of their time. That, to me, I think is going where the world is going. I think people are going to put more value on their data. Even individual consumers are going to wake up to the fact that there's nothing free. And so, it's a choice. It's not to say that there isn't room for someone to say, ""Yeah, this is a good trade, where I'm using a free service in exchange for some data."" But there's nothing free about it.Fortt: So is there a Plan B for Bing, for Outlook.com, et cetera, that says, you know what? If we get to the point where tracking is something that there's a backlash against, we have a plan for that. Nadella: Absolutely. I mean, in fact, in a lot of these things, in Search, in particular, we have taken great pains that it's only ads that are being driven on intent, which is part of the results page. We don't take that data, use it elsewhere. We don't have any targeting business that is at large. We are very, very conscious of those choices that we have made, in terms of making sure that the products that we create are all about users' interests, as the first and foremost.Fortt: On cloud, you said when we sat down four years ago, ""If you're not already spending a lot of capital on the order of $4 or $5 billion each year to grow your…""Nadella: Which has increased.Fortt: Which has increased. It doesn't go down, right? ""Probably it's a little too late to enter the market."" You went on to say, ""There are at least two players like that, Amazon and Google, in particular, but we are one of the three in that category."" Update me. How does the competitive field look? Is it still the three? Would you tweak your definition of what it takes to really be...Nadella: Capital investment is one part of it. And clearly, I think Amazon and us, when it comes to broad cloud platform, are number one and number two. And that game's on, and each quarter you all track us on that progress. And Google's also in there and obviously has a lot of money and a lot of capital and is investing a ton.Fortt: $2 billion, I think they recently announced? They're starting to show some numbers.Nadella: And so, to me, what I think is going to be important here is increasingly trust. What I mean by that is it's not just about capital. Let's say among the three of us if you think about talking to a CEO of an industrial company, a CEO of a health care company, a financial services company…Fortt: A grocery company.Nadella: Yeah. Grocery company, good example. I think it's going to come down to trust. Trust not just in the technology, the ethics around AI, privacy, security — all that also matters — [but] trust in business model, where that alignment of your interests as a customer and the interests of the provider are fully aligned. I sort of say one of the currencies is what you think, what you say, and what you do have to be in alignment.Fortt: Now, I'm reading between the lines here. I hear stories about retailers coming to Microsoft because hey, Amazon's all in grocery now, with Whole Foods. Retailers are looking over their shoulder wondering, Amazon's got a good platform, but at the same time, are they going to come at the core of my business model?Nadella: Yeah, it's not even just Amazon, by the way. You've got to remember, Amazon and Google both are fantastic at being able to rig transactions. It's not that, you know, Google is somehow more friendly to retailers.They have a nice two-sided market that they can subsidize one to advantage [the other] and also, by the way, the advertising business is just so funky, which is sort of second priced auction. I've never seen business models where [when] there's more demand, there are higher prices.So I feel like any customer who is essentially subsidizing their own tax increase should think through exactly how that's going to work out in the long run. So that's where I feel like long-run business model trust is going to be so important.Fortt: How do you structure your workforce to, I guess, best embrace that interest in trust that the customer has? Is there a different approach in sales, in messaging? What are you telling people?Nadella: In fact, that's where you're getting every part of your organization aligned, starting with your sense of purpose and mission. That's why when I say we want to empower people in organizations all over the planet it's got to be more than a set of words.Our success is based on our customers' success. Second is then create that business model. Take subscriptions. If you don't use it, they will churn out. That means you only get paid when they're using it and driving value. Consumption business model, so getting fully aligned on the business model. And then shaping the culture, whether it's the person in the field, we now have these new roles in the field called customer success. That's all about making sure that the customers are able to do what they want to do with technology to impact their business. And to me, that type of transformation and consistency, it can't be like I'm doing something here, but something else somewhere else.Fortt: How do you compensate customer success?Nadella: Just by how customers are rating you. NPS is a good one.Fortt: Net Promoter Scores.Nadella: Net Promoter Scores is a good one. Are they consuming? For example, have they activated all the capabilities? So we have what we describe as leading indicators of success of our customers. And in fact compensate our folks, not on revenue, not on margin, but on those metrics.Fortt: Interesting. I think we've already established you were right about a lot of things over the past four-plus years. What were you wrong about?Nadella: I think the thing that has caught me most by surprise is how multi-constituent… Even when I started out four years ago, I thought I understood it's about customers. It's about our employees. It's about our shareholders.But it's not just that. It is about recognizing that in every community that we operate in and serve, there are multiple constituents that all have to be in harmony with your interests. That is probably the place where I've learned a lot. Fortt: Starbucks just got a lesson in that, if I'm reading you the right way. Somebody who's in your store, you've made a certain brand promise, they haven't bought anything necessarily, but they can have a big impact on the perception of your brand.Nadella: Yeah, by the way, I'm on the board of Starbucks, and I think that Starbucks and Kevin [Johnson] and team responded to something that was a brand promise, and what the expectation was, very well. And I feel like they've set the bar, in fact, of how it's not about sort of being perfect, it's about being able to learn from things that happen and to be able to improve and change the culture of your organization. That's what we're doing, as well.Fortt: So what drove that home for you? You said that was an area that caught you off guard a bit, the multi-constituent nature of your job. Was there a moment where you realized…Nadella: Yeah, I'll tell you. In fact, one of my biggest moments was, we got a letter probably my first year in from the association of the blind in the United States about saying, ""Hey, look, you guys have to take software, work you do, very seriously for accessibility, especially for people with visual impairment."" And I've always, in fact, championed — long before I was CEO, I used to be the one who internally championed our accessibility work. But that's when it struck me as, this can't be a checkbox. This requires us to integrate into the mainstream, and, you know, universal design needs to become something that is much more culturally ingrained in everything we do.And it's been phenomenal. I mean, to me, [it's] some of the most exciting impact of AI, whether it's gaze technology, and what it can do for someone with ALS, or some machine reading technology, and what it can do with someone with dyslexia. That's now been an awakening for us.And that's when it caught me in saying that, you know, that particular advocacy group sending me a letter was a bit of a wake-up call for me to sort of recognize that we will only be a company that we, you know, want to be, if we take all constituents, and but yet approach with that universality in our products.Fortt: I think you can expect some more letters from advocacy groups now. What do you have new around that specifically, accessibility at Build?Nadella: Yeah, so one of the things that we did last year was something called ""AI for Earth."" The idea is not just build technology and advances in AI, but to use it to fund organizations' research that are going to really turn, in that case, AI for things like tackling climate change or creating an early warning system for Zika, or what have you.And so we're now going to take that same approach for AI for accessibility. So we are putting a $25 million grant, which is going be available to research institutions and other nonprofits to be able to take advantage of, and use AI tech to solve some of the accessibility challenges out there.Fortt: I think the last time I sat down with you, [former GE CEO] Jeff Immelt was next to you. And you were talking about ways that Azure and Predix, GE's platform for industrial software, were going to work together. GE is announcing that they are cutting their digital unit by more than 25 percent this year, but the industrial internet moves on. Are you going to do anything within Microsoft to pick up the slack for what companies like GE might cut back? Different partnerships?Nadella: In fact, we just were coming back from Hanover, where the biggest industrial conference happened. And it's stunning to see — you know, Microsoft would go to Hanover in the past and we had an embedded business. But this has now become a main show for us, if you look at the number of announcements coming out with this fundamental fact that Azure, along with Azure Edge, is becoming built-in to every modern factory. I mean, one of the things I even talked about in our earnings last quarter was turning to material handling. Literally, they're taking the material handling in a particular modern factory that they're building, a digital factory, using drones to fly through to optimize the pallet routing and optimize the entire supply chain efficiency.Or Bühler, in fact, that's another company, that most of the corn in the world goes through their machines. And it turns out that if you really want to protect the food production of the world as it relates to corn, you want to detect any toxin early on. They're using computer vision at the Edge to be able to in their, you know, machines.Fortt: Already they're doing that.Nadella: Already. And we're working with them. So to me, being able to sort of translate what I think of as our AI promise, or our cloud and its Edge, into these industrial applications, those are the killer apps. That's what I celebrate.Fortt: Closer to home, there's this tension between big tech and the communities around big tech. Not just in Seattle area, also seen in Silicon Valley, in particular. But in Seattle right now, Seattle proper, there's this proposal for a head tax. Basically, I think it's $500 for every worker just for big companies and to pay for homeless services.My gut says this isn't really so much about homeless services as perhaps it's this tension between, boy, these big tech companies are raising the standard, making it more expensive, gentrifying, and it's good for some people, but not good for everybody. We need them to give something back. Is that your view on what this is really about? And what does a company like Microsoft, any big tech company do to perhaps better this, change the narrative, move the debate forward?Nadella: I think it's the right dialogue for us to have, first of all. Because in some sense, I've always believed that if just a few multinational companies are the only companies that are getting bigger and more profitable than the rest of the economy, is not showing the same vibrancy in employing people and in general, inequality increases in society, that's not stable. That's not stable for any liberal democracy.Fortt: So is the tax a good idea? Is it the answer?Nadella: I don't know whether that particular tax is a good idea, because you've got to make sure, basically — because all taxes, you know, can create unintended consequences for economic growth. So you've got to think it through. It's a system. But that said, though, should every community think about how to make sure that the people in the community, across all parts of the economic strata, are able to live there, thrive there? Absolutely. If there is what you call gentrification and the housing expenses are just going up, that's no solution. Our own employees will not want to live in a non-diverse community over time, so we will have to have responsibility, quite frankly, in every community. Not just in Seattle, not just in Redmond, but in every country we operate in. That's why I think of us as a multinational company.Every time I go into any capital or any city or any community inside the United States, I always ask myself how many people are around Microsoft — how many partners, who do they employ, what are their median salaries, what is the opportunity? Without that, I don't think Microsoft continues to thrive.Fortt: But what do you do differently to get a different resolution? I remember 15 years ago living in Silicon Valley, sitting down, having this conversation with the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. Boy, it's really expensive, it's hard to recruit workers into Silicon Valley. But housing prices there are up at least 2.5x, since then.Nadella: I think on this particular one, there are some solutions. I think we should first of all collect the data and say, wow, there is ways to create lower, you know, I would say low cost housing and accessibility to low-cost housing in these urban centers so that we don't have just runaway costs of housing. I think some of these things — whether it's runaway costs of our health care, runaway costs of our education, or runaway costs of housing — these are challenges that I think have to be faced and market forces should work to solve those problems.Fortt: There's a U.S. trade delegation in China right now trying to work some things out. What's the best case scenario out of that, as far as what gets brought back?Nadella: Here's my simple view: I think the next 10 years, next 20 years, next 30 years, whatever your time horizon, is going to be defined by these two countries — China and the United States — creating more interdependence, not less.That's what's going to be good for the two countries. That's what's going to be good for the world. So my hope is that any dialogue that happens in any capital, in any venue, is all about sort of breaking through. I think there are legitimate issues that need to be discussed. But you need to come up with solutions, because interdependence is probably good for economic growth and stability for the world.Fortt: Any third rails you see?Nadella: When you say third rail, what do you mean?Fortt: Things that they shouldn't touch, or push, or…Nadella: I think that anything that sort of creates uncertainty is just not good. Whom does it serve? I think that the more we recognize that it's true, that globalization, or free trade, as it was conceived, has not created equitable growth in all parts. Like, that's the issue that I think is being debated. So that means you've got to go back, though, to the real principles of free trade and make sure that they are, in fact, implemented fairly.Fortt: I want to talk about something that we've talked about before, which is gender diversity, women at Microsoft. About a month ago, the Seattle Times did a big story on Microsoft's culture. It said, ""The culture is still male dominant. There's casual sexism and change comes slowly."" Did you think it was fair?Nadella: I think that, you know, this is an issue that is front and center for me, and for my leadership team, because in some sense, yes, change happens slowly, but we have to push every day and make progress every day. And that's where I have to hold myself accountable.In fact, it starts with culture. When I think about the amount of time I and my leadership team now spend on making sure that we have that everyday inclusive culture. At every meeting, we're able to make sure that the people, the diverse group we have — gender, ethnic — are all able to participate. So I think it starts with culture, and taking it as first class. Second, it just cannot be just words. It also has to be a set of metrics. So, for example, my own compensation and my leadership team's compensation is now tied to a set of metrics where we have to make progress year-over-year. So I think you've got to go to work on this, whether it's on the culture or the metrics that really promote diversity and inclusion. And it's the right thing for us to focus on. And not be satisfied with whatever we have.Fortt: Is that a new thing, on tying compensation to diversity metrics? I remember, you know, Brian Krzanich, [CEO] at Intel, is doing something where by job category, he wants, you know, the target to be, let's reach the available population, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So if electrical engineers are 35 percent women, then that's our target. Not 50-50, but 35 percent because — that used to be called quotas, and it was a dirty word. How does it factor in now that we're at the place we are in diversity?Nadella: I think, first of all, we've got to start by saying this: Don't think of this as a quota. This is, in fact again, necessary for business success. I mean, think about what a diverse team can do in a multi-constituent world. I mean, if you go back to the question you asked me, ""What has surprised you?""What's surprised me is, wow, as a company, we have to serve many constituents and their interests, their unmet and articulated needs. So every product group, every sales team, every marketing team will be better served by having diversity.And so to me, having representation reflect the world we want to serve is the best thing that we can do for our long-term business. And so that's what inspires, you know, drives us. And even there, having some metrics on progress. For example, take women and woman representation. Over the last 18 months, we've had a 50 percent increase in the number of corporate vice presidents at Microsoft. That's fantastic to see. Is it sufficient? Absolutely not. But is it a move in the right direction? I think so.Fortt:  What are you reading now? As we as we start to wrap up?Nadella: I'm reading a book, God I forget the thing, it's The Multiple Literacies of Leadership. It's a fascinating book, which sort of speaks, in some sense, to this intellectual pursuit now I have around saying, it's not just one stroke you can have. You've got to think about the complexity, the ambiguity that exists, the uncertainty that exists in the world. You need to be able to then turn that into understanding and clarity. And you can't be excellent in just one thing, even as a leader and the way you lead. Somebody sort of said this very beautifully to me which is, for example, clarity — I talk a lot about what leaders fundamentally do is about bringing clarity. But it's about clarity of where you need to get to, but not be too dogmatic about the means and being able to even have that distinction.So I've lately gone back to leadership and another book that I recently read, which I loved, which is just something that I think about a lot, is Forged in Crisis. And that's a great book of some people, like, you know [Abraham] Lincoln, in particular and how he came through his two terms to change history, has been a real imprint on me.Fortt: Finally, Satya Nadella before work. What's your routine? Is there something that you do before you're in the door, you're on? I mean, a lot of us start work really before we get to work, of course. But before you even get into that mode, is there a certain preparation that you feel works for you?Nadella: I think my ritual is, however short on time or sleep or whatever, I somehow figure out or manage to get my 30 minutes of a run every day, wherever I am. And that, I must say, is perhaps what gives me all the energy and more.Fortt: Keeps you trim, too.Nadella: I hope so.Fortt: Yeah, the camera doesn't lie, it does. Satya, thanks.Nadella: Thank you so much, Jon."

Microsoft doesn't have any ""targeting business that is at large"" on its platforms, CEO Satya Nadella said. Google and Amazon, he said, use revenue from advertising and retail to support their cloud businesses and other ventures — which might run counter to the interests of their business customers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says consumer trust will push the company's cloud product ahead of competitors Amazon and Google. ""Trust, not just in the technology, the ethics around AI, privacy, security — all that also matters —[but] trust in [the] business model,"" Nadella told CNBC in an interview published Monday.Core business models of tech firms have come under heightened scrutiny in recent weeks, amid growing concerns about user privacy and revelations of just how much data companies like Facebook and Alphabet's Google collect on their users.Microsoft doesn't have any ""targeting business that is at large"" on its platforms, Nadella said. The company leverages subscriptions with limited ad-supported businesses to help customers ""get more out of their data, more out of their time."" ""I think people are going to put more value on their data. Even individual consumers are going to wake up to the fact that there's nothing free,"" Nadella said. ""It's not to say that there isn't room for someone to say, 'Yeah, this is a good trade, where I'm using a free service in exchange for some data.' But there's nothing free about it.""The Microsoft chief pegged Amazon as his most direct competitor in the increasingly important cloud space — with Google a close third.The tech giants have all been ramping up investment in cloud computing in recent years, as the so-called internet of things and ever-growing pool of connected devices demands greater computing power and storage capability. But Google and Amazon, he said, use revenue from advertising and retail to support their cloud businesses and other ventures — which might run counter to the interests of their business customers.""Amazon and Google both are fantastic at being able to rig transactions. So it's not that Google is somehow more friendly to retailers,"" Nadella said. ""They have a nice two-sided market that they can subsidize one to advantage [the other].""Nadella called the advertising business ""funky,"" with its auction-based pricing model that raises prices as more retailers buy in. ""I've never seen business models where, [when] there's more demand, there are higher prices,"" he said. ""So I feel like any customer who is essentially subsidizing their own tax increase should think through exactly how that's going to work out in the long run.""

254,2018-05-07T11:30:00-0400," The Project Brainwave system uses field-programmable gate arrays from Intel. The chips boost the performance of Microsoft's Azure machine learning cloud service, and over time will become available for use in other facilities. Google has taken a different approach, designing its own AI chip.  As the cloud battle heats up, Microsoft is taking a unique approach to silicon that it says can help developers more quickly perform artificial intelligence computing tasks.An initiative called Project Brainwave lets developers in Microsoft's data centers use field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which can be customized even after they've been plugged into servers. Microsoft announced that the chips will be accessible for the first time on Monday at the Build Developer conference.According to Microsoft, these chips will enable faster processing of images with AI models than what's available from Amazon Web Services or Google's cloud. Those companies and others like China's Alibaba offer an assortment of chips, ranging from graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia to Google's homegrown tensor processing units (TPUs).Microsoft says another advantage to using commercially available FPGAs, manufactured by longtime partner Intel, is that companies will be able to set up similar technology in their own locations, and not be limited to working in the cloud. That's part of Microsoft's strategy of providing more flexibility to customers.""It's not like we're sacrificing performance or a competitive angle by going with the FPGAs,"" said Doug Burger, leader of Project Brainwave. ""I think we are owning our own destiny.""The chips will initially be available within Microsoft's Azure machine learning service for 42 cents an hour. Over time, Microsoft will give developers direct access to the chips, said Burger, who is also a distinguished engineer at the company. Microsoft has for years been drawn to FPGAs. In 2014, the company said it would use them to speed up Bing web search queries. By the following year, Microsoft was installing an FPGA in every server it bought for Azure, initially to provide better networking performance, Burger said.Intel jumped into FPGAs in 2015, with its $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera. Diane Bryant, a former Intel executive who is now at Google's cloud, told Wired that Microsoft was the reason Intel bought Altera.One company exploring the use of the Brainwave technology is electronics manufacturer Jabil. The company, known as a prominent supplier to Apple, is looking to avoid running into problems during periods of poor cloud connectivity, said Ryan Litvak, a Jabil IT manager.Jabil already kicked off a pilot project in the cloud last month to examine photos coming in from two manufacturing lines in China. Jabil sites have inspection stations where cameras take pictures of partially assembled circuit boards. Operators have set rules that flag photos on boards that have issues so they can get sent for review. Litvak said that based on early results, the AI system powered by Brainwave could cut down on 75 percent of the false positives, or boards that are sent for review despite not having any problems.""Project Brainwave looks like a really good option for still maintaining a high level of performance at a lower price point than using GPUs,"" Litvak said. He said the Azure service is a natural for Jabil because the company has long been a Microsoft customer, from Windows to Office.While Microsoft is making a public push with FPGAs, Burger wouldn't say if the company is also following Google's lead in building its own chips to accelerate AI workloads in data centers. ""If you want to make an economically rational decision, of course you're going to look at the various options,"" he said."

Here we're in a tougher part of the mandate domestically and that requires more explanations,"" the source added.Macron was elected in May 2017 against a far-right candidate on a promise to create jobs and drive growth by cutting corporate taxes, easing France's rigid labour regulations, and developing a more skilled labour force.He began making good on those campaign pledges in a reform blitz during the first 18 months of his presidency that impressed investors but infuriated low-paid workers, who feel he favours big business and is indifferent to their struggle to make ends meet.Over the past two months, that popular anger has been vented at protests across France. The unrest has convulsed Macron and his government and forced costly concessions.Macron is not attending the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, his office says, so that he can deal with quelling the ""yellow vest"" uprising.Below are some of the key investment pledges announced on Monday:* Microport: 350 million euros over five years to expand a Research &amp; Development centre.* Mars: 120 million euros invested in eight different sites including the Haguenau plant where M&amp;Ms are produced.* Procter &amp; Gamble: 50 million euros investment in a new detergent production line at its Amiens plant.* Transpod: 20 million euro investment to finance a 3km hyperloop test line.

259,2018-04-27T16:42:02-0400," In the first quarter, Amazon controlled one-third of the market for cloud infrastructure services, according to Synergy Research Group. Microsoft and Google gained share, the firm said. Microsoft continued to eat into Amazon's lead in the cloud infrastructure market in the first quarter, though there remains a big gap between the two.Amazon Web Services held 33 percent of the cloud infrastructure market in the quarter, which is flat from a year earlier, according to data published Friday by Synergy Research Group. The market includes raw computing and storage, services for running applications and hosted private cloud.Microsoft's share of the market jumped to 13 percent from 10 percent a year earlier. Google increased to 6 percent from 5 percent. Sequentially Amazon's market share fell by a percentage point.All three companies reported financial results this week and each topped analysts' estimates, highlighting expansion in their cloud businesses as drivers of overall growth. Investors are still most bullish on Amazon, pushing the stock up 4 percent on Friday, following the earnings report, and lifting its rally for the year to 35 percent.Microsoft recently instituted organizational changes to better capitalize on its cloud business,  pushing more resources to Scott Guthrie, who has overseen the rise of the company's Azure unit.Research firm Canalys published findings that were similar to Synergy's on Friday, showing that while AWS has stayed above 30 percent market share, Microsoft made a clear gain in the past year, with Google notching a modest improvement. Amazon is the only one of the three companies that breaks out its cloud division in terms of sales. The company said on Thursday that AWS revenue jumped 49 percent to $5.44 billionin the first quarter.Microsoft said Azure revenue jumped 93 percent. KeyBanc analysts estimated Azure had $1.76 billion in revenue, while Raymond James analysts predicted the number was $2.05 billion.One thing to watch: cloud growth could start to more clearly impact Microsoft's margins because Azure is less profitable than the company's legacy software products.""You'll see some gross margin percentage pressure in that segment through 2019, but with significant dollar growth,"" said Microsoft CFO Amy Hood, on the company's conference call on Thursday."

The company's major More Personal Computing segment included 21 percent revenue growth from Windows commercial products and cloud services. Microsoft saw its stock fall as much as 2.5 percent on Thursday immediately after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter. But the stock jumped after the company provided estimates for the quarters to come. Earnings: 95 cents per share, excluding certain items, vs. 85 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.   Revenue: $26.82 billion, vs. $25.77 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. In terms of guidance, CFO Amy Hood told analysts on a call after the earnings statement that Microsoft is expecting $28.8-29.5 billion in revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter. Analysts had expected the company to forecast $28.01 billion in revenue for that quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.The stock rose to 3 percent above the closing price of $94.26 per share after Hood announced the guidance.Hood also made brief remarks about the company's upcoming 2019 fiscal year. ""Revenue growth will continue to be driven by the transition to cloud services, she said.Overall, Microsoft's revenue grew 16 percent year over year in the quarter, which was the third quarter of the company's 2018 fiscal year, according to Thursday's earnings statement.The company's biggest business segment, More Personal Computing -- which includes Windows, devices, gaming and search ads -- produced $9.92 billion in revenue, up 13 percent year over year. The segment came in above the FactSet consensus estimate of $9.25 billion, according to StreetAccount.The Productivity and Business Processes segment, which includes Office, LinkedIn and Dynamics, came up with $9.01 billion in revenue, which was up 16.8 percent and above the FactSet consensus estimate of $8.73 billion, according to StreetAccount.Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, containing server products and cloud services, grew 17.3 percent with $7.90 billion in revenue. The results exceeded the $7.68 billion FactSet estimate.In the fiscal third quarter Microsoft acquired data storage company Avere and gaming start-up PlayFab, and it announced a major reorganization that included the departure of Windows and Devices chief Terry Myerson from the company. The Windows and Devices Group was effectively split up and put inside the Experiences and Devices group (which includes Microsoft's Office 365 and other productivity applications) and the Cloud and Artificial Intelligence Platform group (which includes infrastructure products like Windows Server and the Azure cloud platform).""We think folding Windows into the new Experiences and Devices division, which is led by a former Office executive, sends a strong signal of the supporting, and not leading, role Windows will likely take in coming years, and we like the continued emphasis on hybrid cloud and [artificial intelligence],"" Stifel analysts led by Brad Reback wrote in a Sunday note.But Windows remains the main revenue contributor for Microsoft's More Personal Computing business segment. One indicator for Windows sales, IDC's PC shipments, was flat year over year in the first quarter of 2018 but better than expected, the Stifel analysts wrote.Intelligent Cloud contains the Azure public cloud, which competes with Amazon Web Services and represents Microsoft's biggest growth driver overall. Microsoft as usual didn't provide an exact revenue figure for Azure but did say revenue rose 93 percent year over year, which is down sequentially from 98 percent revenue growth. The Stifel analysts said they were expecting growth just over 90 percent, while analysts led by Kirk Materne at Evercore ISI said in a Sunday note they were looking for 82 percent Azure growth.The deceleration in Azure's revenue growth could have been one factor that caused Microsoft stock to fall immediately after the company reported earnings, Piper Jaffray analyst Alex Zukin told CNBC.On the call with analysts after the earnings release, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that one Azure service, the Cosmos DB database offering, had more than $100 million in annualized revenue. Microsoft said its ""commercial cloud,"" which entails Azure, Office 365, Dynamics 365 and other cloud services, had $6 billion in revenue in the fiscal third quarter, up 58 percent year over year and up 13 percent sequentially.There were 30.6 million Office 365 consumer subscribers in the quarter, up sequentially from 29.2 million. On the Office 365 commercial side, revenue grew 42 percent. The Xbox Live gaming service had 59 million users.Microsoft's Dynamics 365 revenue increased 65 percent, while LinkedIn revenue grew 37 percent, and Surface revenue rose 32 percent.The company reported $3.5 billion in capital expenditures, its highest level yet and up 66 percent year over year.Microsoft stock is up 10 percent since the beginning of 2018.- CNBC's Josh Lipton contributed to this story."

Apple is also involved in the project through a partnership with the North Carolina Department of Transportation.Virginia Tech, one of the winners, said that Alphabet's Project Wing, AT&amp;T, Intel, Airbus and Dominion Energy are among the partners for its pilot program that will explore package delivery, emergency management and infrastructure inspection.A spokesman for the North Carolina Department of Transportation, another winner, said Apple Is among its partners, and Apple said it plans to use the testing program to improve Apple Maps by capturing aerial images. ""Apple is committed to protecting people's privacy, including processing this data to blur faces and license plates prior to publication,"" the company said.Microsoft is among the partners for a Kansas project, while Qualcomm is joining a winning bid from the City of San Diego to test a wide range of public safety, commercial and emergency response applications.Amazon, which hopes to one day deliver packages with a fleet of drones, said it was unfortunate its applications were not selected but supports the U.S. efforts.""We're focused on developing a safe operating model for drones in the airspace and we will continue our work to make this a reality, said Brian Huseman, Amazon's vice president of public policy.China's DJI said it submitted about a dozen applications.""We congratulate the winners and will be happy to work with any of them with hardware, software or technical assistance to help these exciting ideas come to life,"" said Adam Lisberg, spokesman for the world's largest maker of non-military drones.The pilot program is aimed at producing data to assist the Federal Aviation Administration in establishing rules and regulations to safely integrate drones at scale. The FAA still must decide questions before the pilot projects begin including whether drone deliveries should follow city streets or cross backyards.The 10 pilot drone test projects selected from 149 applications are in California, Tennessee, North Dakota, Nevada, Kansas and other states.Nevada-based Flirtey, a drone delivery startup, said it was a partner on four of the winning applications including Virginia Tech's. Flirtey said in a statement that it and government partners ""will now have access to fast-tracked regulatory approvals as they work to expand lifesaving drone delivery operations.""U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said that drone use is surging. She said the administration must ""create a path forward"" to ensure the safe integration of drones.She said there are ""no losers"" and she thinks dozens of the applicants not chosen could be greenlighted by the FAA in the coming months.Asked why the Transportation Department had not selected Amazon or DJI, Deputy Transportation Secretary Jeff Rosen told Reuters that the projects had gone through a rigorous review process. ""There were no losers -- only winners,"" Rosen said. ""This is an important first step in the process of drone integration.""Memphis Airport Authority Chief Executive Scott Brockman told Reuters that it had also been picked and that its partner FedEx will use drones to inspect aircraft at its hub in Tennessee as well as parts deliveries for aircraft and some package deliveries between the airport and other Memphis locations. Another partner is General Electric, he said.Earlier, the department confirmed it had sent two planned rules to the White House to regulate the increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles.One rule submitted would allow drones to fly over people while another proposal submitted would allow for remote identification and tracking of unmanned aircraft in flight. After both are formally proposed, it would take months or possibly more than a year before they are finalized.Current rules prohibit nighttime drone flights or operations over people without a waiver from the FAA. The FAA has no requirements or voluntary standards for electrically broadcasting information to identify an unmanned aircraft.The FAA has said regulations are necessary to protect the public and the National Airspace System from bad actors or errant hobbyists. Several incidents around major airports have involved drones getting close to aircraft.The wide interest in the U.S. initiative, launched by President Donald Trump last year, underscores the desire of a broad range of companies to have a say in how the fledgling industry is regulated and ultimately win authority to operate drones for purposes ranging from package delivery to crop inspection.

Mainland China accounts for nearly 10 percent of the company's revenue — a share that's been steadily decreasing over the past three years, according to FactSet.Globalization, as it was conceived, ""has not created equitable growth in all parts,"" Nadella said — and the solution is discussion and fair implementation of free trade principles.""I think that anything that creates uncertainty is just not good. Whom does it serve?"" Nadella said. ""So my hope is that any dialogue that happens in any capital, in any venue, is all about sort of breaking through. I think there are legitimate issues that need to be discussed. But you need to come up with solutions."" Listen to the full interview on Fortt Knox: "

The protests started in mid-November over higher fuel taxes, which were then scrapped.""The gilet jaunes, the yellow jackets, are an expression of what we call 'ras-le-bol' (or) 'I'm fed up.' … My understanding is that (Macron) is determined to change, he is determined to transform the country and he will take more into consideration the need of the middle-class and the lower-middle-class and clearly, that class has suffered,"" Levy added.Macron held a dinner for business leaders before the first day of WEF at the Palace of Versailles on Monday night, telling them that he would continue to reform the country despite the protests. Guests were said to include Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.The President started reforms soon after his election in May 2017 that cut corporate taxes and eased labor regulations, but workers feel that he has neglected their needs.""They see all these changes and they are not prepared for all these changes, so we need to share much better the burden and we have to accept, to slow down maybe some reforms but we definitely, definitely have to transform the country,"" Levy said.Levy added that he felt there needed to be Europe-wide reform. ""When you look at what is required to transform Europe, you need to change our fiscal system, you need to change our social system, you need to transform our labor code, we have so many thing to do because we have been so conservative in the past and so protective, and today we are lagging behind when it comes to competition because we are not adapted to this new world.""Macron announced a three-month nationwide debate last week, in an open letter published in French media outlets. He is seeking views on taxation, the organization of public spending savings, bureaucratic procedures and citizenship and democracy. He did not mention whether there would be a possible referendum on his policies.- CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report"
265,2018-04-19T11:28:18-0400," Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos writes a closely watched annual letter every year. Among the Amazon Way secrets in this year's letter: The tech giant's teams do not use Microsoft Powerpoint to share ideas. They actually write, and read, six-page memos. Amazon has the power with one rumor about a new business effort to sink entire sectors of the market, far beyond the retail industry it has has already upended. It also may have the power of the word to finish off the era of Microsoft's corporate meeting monolith.""We don't do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon.""That was among the kernels of Amazon wisdom in the closely watched letter to shareholders released by Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos on Wednesday. Powerpoint has always had its detractors, being compared by some to Soviet propaganda tools and even implicated in NASA's inability to figure out what went wrong in two Space Shuttle disasters, Columbia and Challenger. President Trump's Defense Secretary James Mattis once said ""PowerPoint makes us stupid."" So Bezos — and all the corporate cubicle drones — are not alone.But PowerPoint has still held on in corporate meetings around the world that, in most cases, go on too long themselves. Microsoft has found itself challenged on many fronts in the office, from richly valued start-up Slack's rise as a challenger to email and Google Docs. And a few months ago when the Wall Street Journal ran a piece saying chief financial officers were instructing teams to stop using Excel, finance operations around the globe were rocked — as rocked as finance teams can get rocked.What does Amazon do instead to share ideas and plan strategy? Read and write at length, according to Bezos.""We write narratively structured six-page memos. We silently read one at the beginning of each meeting in a kind of 'study hall.' Not surprisingly, the quality of these memos varies widely. Some have the clarity of angels singing. They are brilliant and thoughtful and set up the meeting for high-quality discussion. Sometimes they come in at the other end of the spectrum."" The difference between a great memo and an average one is one of the few things that Bezos says he finds it difficult to identify, but ""much of the time, readers react to great memos very similarly. They know it when they see it. The standard is there, and it is real, even if it's not easily describable."" What do memo writers do wrong? They don't spend enough time on their writing.""They mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more! "" Bezos wrote. He went on: ""The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. ... The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope – that a great memo probably should take a week or more.""And maybe also kill off Powerpoint, once and for all.

267,2018-04-17T15:50:19-0400," Smith said the tech industry is increasingly able to figure out who's behind cyberattacks. Amazon and Google have not yet agreed to the Cybersecurity Tech Accord. Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said on Tuesday that the company is ""principled"" about the sorts of people it works with.The statement comes on the same day that Microsoft announced it's one of 34 companies that signed the Cybersecurity Tech Accord, a document promising that, among other things, participants won't help governments operate cyberattacks against innocent people or companies. ""When it comes to people asking for help from our consultants or other services of that kind, we can pick and choose, we can be principled, and we are,"" Smith said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell.""Smith said technology companies are increasingly able to figure out who's behind cyberattacks. The U.S. blamed North Korea for the WannaCry attack, for example, he said, and the NotPetya ransomware attack has been attributed to Russia.""One never holds people necessarily responsible for their government, but one does have the ability to be very careful in what one does with the government itself,"" said Smith, who became Microsoft's president in 2015, taking on a title that had not existed at the company since 2002, when Richard Belluzzo left.Earlier this week Microsoft announced new security tools, including a secure operating system for internet-connected devices.HPE and Oracle are among the other companies that have signed onto the accord. Microsoft's top competitors in the public cloud market, Alphabet and Amazon, are not currently on board."
268,2018-04-16T18:03:55-0400," Microsoft's latest use of Linux comes weeks after a leader of the Windows division lost a seat on the company's senior leadership team.  Microsoft has previously looked to Linux to boost its public cloud and operate equipment in its data centers. Microsoft, which once called Linux a ""cancer,"" is now embracing the open-source operating system and using it to secure internet-connected devices.At an event on Monday, Microsoft introduced Azure Sphere, a package of products including a new design for chips that will be packed into small gadgets deployed around the world, and said it's using Linux to secure these chips. Many products containing small computers are currently not connected to the web, representing a big opportunity for technology companies.The announcement marks Microsoft's latest embrace of a former rival technology, as the company relies less on its legacy Windows franchise and more on providing powerful cloud-connected services.""Of course we are a Windows company, but what we've recognized is the best solution for a computer of this size in a toy is not a full version of Windows,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, said at the event in San Francisco. ""It is what we are creating here."" With the introduction of the Azure Sphere OS, Microsoft will be distributing a custom Linux kernel for the first time, Smith said. The technologies will be free of royalties and licenses.Chipmaker Mediatek said in a statement that it's sampling compatible Azure Sphere-certified chips with some customers. The chips will be more widely available in the third quarter, and more chip partners will be coming over time.Last month, Microsoft announced a major reorganization that led to a leader of Microsoft's Windows organization losing a seat on the company's senior leadership team, with employees of the group getting split across other teams. In recent years, Microsoft has been moving towards Linux and deemphasizing Windows. Microsoft joined the Linux Foundation in 2016. The company changed the name of its public cloud from Windows Azure to Microsoft Azure, as many users now run Linux on it. Microsoft has also introduced a Linux version of its SQL Server database software, and it has worked on an operating system for switches in its data centers that on Linux.That's a much different relationship than the company had with Linux in 2001, when Steve Ballmer, who was Microsoft's CEO at the time, said called it a ""cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.""The Azure Sphere cloud service will enable the connections from one small device to another, as well as connections from a device to various cloud services, all the while picking up on security issues. It will join a wide portfolio of other computing tools available from Microsoft's data centers around the world.At the same time, Microsoft is acknowledging that it's not the only public cloud infrastructure provider. The chips and operating system will be able to connect with Amazon Web Services, or other clouds from the likes of Google, Alibaba, Oracle or IBM, Smith said.""I do believe that it enables us to make an important contribution to what the world needs from us, and that is to work with everyone to put security first and help to create a safer world,"" he said."

""We have to look at San Francisco and say here's the best technology example in the world and yet the worst homelessness.""""San Francisco is kind of a train wreck, we have a real inequality problem,"" he said. ""It's because of the tech sector.""A one-night count of San Francisco's homeless population in 2017 showed that roughly 7,500 people were without homes, according to figures released by the city in June.In California as a whole, separate figures from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development showed there were 134,000 homeless people statewide on any given night in 2017. The number of homeless Californians jumped 13.7 percent in 2017 from the previous year.The Salesforce chief was a vocal proponent of Proposition C, a bill aimed at fighting homelessness by raising taxes on big businesses in San Francisco. The measure was passed in November and is expected to generate up to $300 million in new tax revenue to tackle the city's homelessness crisis.Benioff entered a battle of words over the proposal on Twitter with the social network's CEO Jack Dorsey last year after the latter made his view known that Prop C was not the ""best way"" to address homelessness in San Francisco and California as a whole.""Prop C was a great example of where we had people who were very committed to getting that done and improving things in San Francisco,"" Benioff said Tuesday. ""Each CEO is responsible for their little part.""He said that ""not every CEO"" was committed to fighting inequality, and some were in fact battling ""tooth and nail"" to defeat Prop C. Benioff added that his criticism was not limited to Dorsey.Other tech entrepreneurs, including Stripe CEO Patrick Collison and Zynga founder Mark Pincus, also opposed Prop C. Critics backing the campaign No on Prop C claimed it lacked accountability and oversight.For his part, Dorsey said the proposition would unfairly treat his financial services firm Square and Collison's Stripe, claiming they would have to pay disproportionately more in tax than the likes of Salesforce.Microsoft recently raised the alarm on the issue of homelessness, but not in California. The Redmond, Washington-based software giant earlier this month committed $500 million to build more affordable housing in Seattle."

Management specifically highlighted women's sportswear, sleepwear, fashion jewelry, fashion watches and cosmetics as areas of weakness.""It gave you the impression of a broad-based slowdown in consumer spending,"" Cramer said on ""Mad Money.""But after seeing sportswear retailer Lululemon raise its fourth-quarter outlook, consumer technology giant Apple get supply-constrained for its increasingly popular Watch, and price-conscious companies like Amazon and Ulta Beauty seize on selling affordable makeup, Cramer started to think that Macy's weakness was company-specific.""Put it all together and it makes me think that Macy's has some unique issues that simply don't reflect what's going on in the rest of retail,"" he said, adding that PVH, the apparel manufacturer that sells its products in Macy's stores, recently issued a positive pre-announcement of its quarterly results.That's why investors can't always look at the retail sector as one bucket of similar companies, the ""Mad Money"" host said.""To me, the real takeaway from the Macy's madness is that you've got to go category by category,"" Cramer explained.

""A recurring service revenue stream is very, very lucrative.""Better yet, Wall Street loved the move, with Netflix's 6.52 percent rise taking the broader market higher. That's a signal that other service providers that charge customers on a recurring basis can follow in Netflix's footsteps, Cramer said.In fact, the company's move highlighted ""two other bargains, two companies with service revenue streams that could easily get away with raising their prices: Amazon and Apple,"" Cramer said.Click here to read more.The market's fear gauge is signaling that stocks will see less volatility and higher prices in the next few months, Cramer said after consulting with a top volatility chartist.The fear gauge, also known as the CBOE Volatility Index or the VIX, tracks S&amp;P 500 option prices to measure near-term expectations of volatility, or the chances that the stock market will endure dramatic swings in the near future. When the VIX rises, it tends to mean investors are growing concerned about the market and making bets to protect themselves.But the VIX has been trading lower since it peaked in December amid a marketwide sell-off, suggesting that fears about the market are subsiding. To make sense of the action after the late-2018 fallout, Cramer asked technician Mark Sebastian, founder of OptionPit.com and resident ""Mad Money"" VIX expert, for his input.Sebastian, who also works with Cramer at RealMoney.com, said that while the nature of the VIX has changed, it's still helpful in predicting what's next for the market.

""As much as we might love the service revenue stream created by all these apps, including the health-care ones, most investors treat Apple like it's some kind of hardware company ... on the verge of becoming obsolete.""The problem stems from the iPhone, Cramer explained. In 2018, iPhone sales accounted for 63 percent of Apple's revenue, so the moment they started to decline, investors wrote the company off.But with an installed base of 1.4 billion users, a growing ecosystem of apps and services and goals of becoming a leading force in digital health care, Apple has a lot more going for it — it just needs to show Wall Street, Cramer argued.""It's time for them to make a big, splashy acquisition ... in the software space,"" he said.

At the event, LG showcased a 4K OLED TV that rolls up when you don't want to watch it.But it's not just big screens: A Chinese company called Royole showed off its flexible screen technology for a smartphone/tablet called the FlexPai. This is the world's first commercially available foldable phone, and it beat Samsung and Apple to market. The company is currently taking orders: The cost? A whopping $1,318, even more than an iPhone.However you may want to hold off. Velazco had a chance to check out the device while at CES, and he admitted ""they're maybe not the most polished devices.""Yet he found the technology compelling. ""The ability to fold out and use the phone as a tablet is frankly really powerful,"" he told CNBC.If you're looking to take a deeper dive into meditation, a Canadian company called Interaxon recently released the Muse 2.The headband goes across your forehead and reads brainwaves in real-time. It then uses auditory cues to provide feedback on the user's meditation state.When it comes to virtual and augmented reality (AR) technology, it usually means wearing large glasses over your eyes, blocking out the world around you.Chinese startup Nreal has plans this year to release their version called Light – which as its name suggests – is a lighter version.""They've been able to take the technology that makes some really impressive AR devices like the Microsoft HoloLens and the Magic Leap and converted it down to this form factor,"" Velazco told CNBC.But the tech editor admits one of the bigger surprises at CES, based on the level of people that seemed into it, was Gillette's heated razor. And the name really says it all.""It's a heated razor that's meant to sort of replicate the experience of getting a hot towel wet shave at a barber shop."" The razor is not in stores yet but according to Engadet's report, it will retail for $160.Another surprising find at CES was burgers. Impossible Foods showed off their latest meatless burger recipe: Impossible Burger 2.0.""The original Impossible Burger used wheat protein and it tasted pretty good, but it kind of didn't give you the same kind of mouth feel that a traditional burger would,"" Velazco explained. ""So they rejiggered the formula. This [latest version] is based on soy protein.""He added: ""You actually get a bit more of the experience of eating meat, plus I think the flavor has been upgraded as well.""On the Money airs on CNBC Saturdays at 5:30 am ET, or check listings for air times in local markets.

Microsoft announced a major reorganization Thursday, establishing two main engineering teams focused on experiences and devices, and cloud and AI platforms.  Terry Myerson, executive vice president of the Windows and devices group, is leaving the company.""Leaving fills me with many emotions,"" Myerson said in a post to his LinkedIn profile. ""But I'm mostly filled with gratitude and optimism – gratitude for the experiences I have had and optimism for the future ahead – both for Microsoft and myself.""Myerson joined Microsoft 21 years ago and oversaw the company's Exchange and Windows 10 products. ""With change comes transition, and one transition we have been planning for is for Terry Myerson to pursue his next chapter outside Microsoft,"" CEO Satya Nadella said in an email to employees. ""Terry has been instrumental in helping me arrive at this new organizational structure, and I deeply appreciate his leadership and insight as we've worked through the opportunity that lies ahead.""The current executive vice president of the product group, Rajesh Jha, will head the experiences and devices team. Current executive vice president of the cloud and enterprise group, Scott Guthrie, will head the cloud and AI team.Jason Zander will take on a bigger role as executive vice president of Microsoft's Azure, putting him in the top ranks of the company. A third engineering team headed by Harry Shum will continue to focus on AI and research.""We can't let any organizational boundaries get in the way of innovation for our customers. This is why a growth mindset culture matters,"" Nadella said. Shares of Microsoft rose slightly after the news. Here's the full email Nadella sent to employees: ""Team, Today, I'm announcing the formation of two new engineering teams to accelerate our innovation and better serve the needs of our customers and partners long into the future. Over the past year, we have shared our vision for how the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge will shape the next phase of innovation. First, computing is more powerful and ubiquitous from the cloud to the edge. Second, AI capabilities are rapidly advancing across perception and cognition fueled by data and knowledge of the world. Third, physical and virtual worlds are coming together to create richer experiences that understand the context surrounding people, the things they use, the places they go, and their activities and relationships. These technological changes represent a tremendous opportunity for our customers, our partners — everyone. With all this new technology and opportunity comes a responsibility to ensure technology's benefits reach people more broadly across society. It also requires that the technologies we create are trusted by the individuals and organizations that use them. Today's announcement enables us to step up to this opportunity and responsibility across all our Solution Areas. With change comes transition, and one transition we have been planning for is for Terry Myerson to pursue his next chapter outside Microsoft. Terry has been instrumental in helping me arrive at this new organizational structure, and I deeply appreciate his leadership and insight as we've worked through the opportunity that lies ahead. Over the past several years, Terry and the WDG team transformed Windows to create a secure, always up-to-date, modern OS. His strong contributions to Microsoft over 21 years from leading Exchange to leading Windows 10 leave a real legacy. I want to thank Terry for his leadership on my team and across Microsoft. He will work with me on the transition over the coming months. Moving forward, Rajesh Jha will expand his existing responsibilities to lead a new team focused on Experiences &amp; Devices. The purpose of this team is to instill a unifying product ethos across our end-user experiences and devices. Computing experiences are evolving to include multiple senses and are no longer bound to one device at a time but increasingly spanning many as we move from home to work and on the go. These modern needs, habits and expectations of our customers are motivating us to bring Windows, Office, and third-party applications and devices into a more cohesive Microsoft 365 experience. To further this vision, we are making the following leadership changes: — Devices: Panos Panay will now serve as our Chief Product Officer and will lead our devices vision and further our product ethos across hardware and software boundaries for our first-party devices, while creating new categories and opportunities for the entire ecosystem. He will be the key leader ensuring end-to-end devices business execution excellence.  — Windows: Joe Belfiore will continue leading our Windows experiences and will drive Windows innovation in partnership with the PC and device ecosystem. The future of Windows is bright as we continue to innovate across new scenarios and device form factors, and more deeply connect to our Microsoft 365 offerings. Joe will share more about the Windows roadmap at Build.  — New Experiences and Technology: Kudo Tsunoda will continue to lead this team to define how we engage users with high-value experiences to help them achieve more.  — Enterprise Mobility and Management: Brad Anderson will continue to lead our Windows Enterprise deployment and management efforts with even tighter alignment across Microsoft 365 and will partner closely with the EMS teams within Cloud + AI Platform. Second, Scott Guthrie will expand his existing responsibilities to lead a new team focused on Cloud + AI Platform. The purpose of this team is to drive platform coherence and compelling value across all layers of the tech stack starting with the distributed computing fabric (cloud and edge) to AI (infrastructure, runtimes, frameworks, tools and higher-level services around perception, knowledge and cognition). To facilitate these new capabilities, we are making the following leadership changes: Azure: Jason Zander is being promoted to executive vice president, Azure, and will lead this team. The Windows platform team led by Harv Bhela, Henry Sanders and Michael Fortin will join Jason's team. Windows platform is already a core part of Azure across both the cloud and edge, and this shift will enable us to accelerate our efforts to build a unified distributed computing infrastructure and application model. Roanne Sones will continue to lead our technical engagement with OEMs, ODMs and silicon vendors, and her team will also join Jason's team.  — Business AI: The Customer Service, Marketing and Sales Insights teams, previously led by Gurdeep Singh Pall, will join James Phillips' Business Applications Group. I am thankful for Gurdeep's leadership in building these new AI solutions that are going to help differentiate Microsoft in this area. This is a notable example of taking research breakthroughs to start new product efforts grounded in customer needs and then mainstreaming them.  — Universal Store and Commerce Platform: Eric Lockard and his team will also join the Cloud + AI Platform team to both help with our own digital transformation and add new capabilities to our business application efforts.  — AI Perception &amp; Mixed Reality (MR): Alex Kipman will lead this new team, which brings together all our speech, vision, MR and additional perception capabilities into one team. This team will continue to build first-party products and the core building block cloud services for third parties on Azure. XD Huang, Yu-Ting Kuo and their teams will join this group, as well as Gurdeep's Ambient Intelligence team. Alex and team will take guidance on all AI-related areas from Harry Shum and work very closely with AI + Research (AI+R).  — AI Cognitive Services &amp; Platform: Eric Boyd will lead this new team and drive our AI Platform, AI Fundamentals, Azure ML, AI Tools and Cognitive Services. Joseph Sirosh and team will join this new group. Eric and team will take guidance on all AI-related areas from Harry Shum and work very closely with AI+R. Harry Shum will continue to lead our third engineering team, AI + Research, which is instrumental in the key technology advances required across all our product teams. When we established AI+R nearly two years ago, our primary goal was to accelerate the adoption of AI innovations from research into product, and the changes we are making today reflect our strong progress. In fact, just yesterday I spent time at TechFest and came away inspired by all the innovations and most importantly how quickly they were making their way into our products. We will continue to drive investments in AI+R across research and AI breakthroughs that are key to our long-term success. As we make technological progress we need to ensure that we are doing so responsibly. To this end, Harry and Brad Smith have established Microsoft's AI and Ethics in Engineering and Research (AETHER) Committee, bringing together senior leaders from across the company to focus on proactive formulation of internal policies and how to respond to specific issues in a responsible way. AETHER will ensure our AI platform and experience efforts are deeply grounded within Microsoft's core values and principles and benefit the broader society. Among other steps, we are investing in strategies and tools for detecting and addressing bias in AI systems and implementing new requirements established by the GDPR. While there is great opportunity, ensuring we always act responsibly for our customers and partners will continue to be a hallmark of our work. To truly get the best impact from our efforts, we will have to push ourselves to transcend Conway's law. Having a deep sense of customers' unmet and unarticulated needs must drive our innovation. We can't let any organizational boundaries get in the way of innovation for our customers. This is why a growth mindset culture matters. Each one of us needs to push on what technology can do for people and for our world. It will take courage to keep learning and growing together — encouraging one another's individual strengths, building more diversity and inclusion across our teams, and collaborating as One Microsoft. It's amazing what we have been able to accomplish together, and yet I still believe we are in the very early days of what is possible. We'll talk more about these changes at the Q&amp;A next week and the important work ahead. Satya"" "
277,2018-03-29T15:03:38-0400," Parts of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group are getting pulled out and placed in other groups as its leader departs. Windows is a key part of Microsoft's legacy, but it's not what's growing the most. Products getting higher priority include Microsoft 365 and Azure. Microsoft's logo is a window. The company's identity is partly built around Windows, because hundreds of millions of people use it.But in announcing Microsoft's latest reorganization Thursday, CEO Satya Nadella is shaping the company around the areas that are growing the most, and Windows will be part of them, rather than the focus.""The platform is not Windows. The platform is now cloud,"" Gartner analyst Ed Anderson told CNBC in an interview. With the changes, Microsoft will be doubling down with products like its Azure public cloud, where developers can use Windows, as well as something called Microsoft 365. That's a new bundle containing Windows and the growing Office 365 cloud productivity business, but also other services that Microsoft can use to grow revenue, as more companies make the shift to Office 365 from traditional Office licenses. More specifically, as Windows and first-party devices have lagged in terms of revenue growth, Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group is being divvied up as its chief, Terry Myerson, leaves.That means more resources are coming under Rajesh Jha, who has led Office in recent years, and Scott Guthrie, the person who has overseen the rise of Azure, as Nadella explained in his all-company memo on Thursday. Meanwhile, the artificial intelligence effort under Harry Shum will largely stay put. So far, the response has been generally positive among current employees.""This is probably one of the most, if not the most, significant reorgs in the company's history with a new EVP [executive vice president] owning multi-billion dollar businesses and breaking up the largest legacy businesses,"" said an employee who's getting moved into one of the two expanding engineering groups. ""If there's one thing about Satya, he's not afraid of making fundamental, disruptive changes to support his vision.""Nadella has been talking about the emergence of a ""cloud-first"" world since he replaced Steve Ballmer as the head of Microsoft in 2014. This reorganization makes Microsoft even more focused on cloud services across the board. In particular, now there's an executive vice president -- a top Microsoft leadership position -- just for Azure. That person, Jason Zander, will be reporting to Guthrie, who will be executive vice president for the expanded Cloud and AI Platform group, a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email.Azure is second to only Amazon Web Services in the public cloud market. While Amazon had 34 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market in the fourth quarter, Azure had 13 percent, more than Google and IBM, according to Synergy Research Group. One person in the Azure organization said they approved of the changes.At the same time, one of Microsoft's most seasoned leaders is stepping away.""I liked Terry a lot,"" said an employee who worked in Myerson's organization. ""He was abrasive and headstrong, which rubbed people the wrong way. But I enjoyed working with him and definitely disappointed that he's leaving.""Microsoft announced a similarly sweeping sales reorganization last year, bringing in more technical salespeople and focusing more on getting customers to use cloud services. Today many people inside Microsoft feel those changes were smart.But ultimately, both reorganizations bolstering Microsoft's cloud push. It's not a major change in direction, at least as Garnter analyst Anderson -- himself a former Microsoft employee -- sees it. Windows can now become a bigger part of the cloud narrative for Microsoft, and it will become more integrated with software in offerings like Microsoft 365.""I don't think Steve Ballmer could have maybe made this change with the same credibility,"" Anderson said. ""I think this has been Satya's role to play, and he's done it well.""--Todd Haselton contributed to this story.WATCH: Bulls target Microsoft"
278,2018-03-29T12:29:26-0400," Microsoft's departing head of Windows Terry Myerson explained why Microsoft failed in the smartphone business. Microsoft built Windows Phone on top of Windows CE at first. Its early decisions left it ""too hobbled to catch up,"" Myerson said. In a farewell post on LinkedIn, Microsoft's former head of Windows, Terry Myerson, explained why Microsoft failed in the smartphone business.It comes down to two problems: Underestimating Android's business model, and building on an older technical platform that wasn't quite ready for the job.""Looking back at this phase of my career, my biggest learnings were that success requires a special composition of business model, user experience, and technology,"" Myerson wrote.""We had a differentiated experience, but it's so clear in hindsight that the disruption in business model which Android represented was enormous, and that building our early versions of Windows Phone on an incomplete Windows CE platform, designed for small embedded systems, left us too hobbled to ever catch up.""Microsoft was one of the early players in the smartphone business with Windows Mobile, which was used by device makers including Motorola, Palm and others, in the mid-2000s.When Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, Microsoft was caught flat-footed. The interface was designed to be used with fingers (instead of a stylus), and had an advanced web browser and other features that made Windows Mobile look stale.Microsoft scrambled to catch up with a new platform. But in the meantime, Google's Android — which was able to duplicate many of the features of the iPhone — appealed to a wide number of third-party handset makers because it was free for them to use and customize. At the same time, Microsoft began its phone revamp on an older platform called Windows CE, which had originally been built for ""embedded"" systems (like bank ATMs) and hand-held organizers, then revamped to support Windows Mobile — without the advanced features that the iPhone and Android already had.By the time Microsoft did all the work necessary to build a modern smartphone platform, Windows Phone, Android had already run away with most of the third-party market. Without a considerable market share, Windows Phone didn't have the same attraction to develop for as iPhone or Android, so popular apps either launched on Windows Phone much later or, in most cases, never at all.Windows Phone was eventually rebranded Windows 10 for Phones in 2015 before Microsoft announced in the fall of 2017 that development for the platform was finished."

Analyst Keith Weiss is raising his 12-month price target to $130, nearly 50 percent higher than where the stock was trading Monday.  Morgan Stanley expects Microsoft's dominant share of the projected $250 billion public cloud market will grow. Investors have been watching Amazon and Apple in the race to $1 trillion in market capitalization, but Morgan Stanley is betting on Microsoft to reach that milestone in the next 12 months thanks to cloud adoption.""Strong positioning for ramping public cloud adoption, large distribution channels and installed customer base, and improving margins support a path to $50 billion in EBIT and a $1 trillion market cap for MSFT,"" Morgan Stanley's Keith Weiss wrote in a note to clients Monday.The investment bank raised its one-year price target from $110 to $130, 49 percent higher than where the stock closed on Friday. At $130, Microsoft would be worth $1 trillion. Its current market value is $671 billion, behind Apple at $856 billion, Amazon at $747 billion and Alphabet at $730 billion.Shares of Microsoft rose more than 5.5 percent following Morgan Stanley's call.Cloud computing uses remote servers hosted to store and process data instead of a personal computer or local server. Microsoft looks poised to keep a dominant share of the public cloud market, which Morgan Stanley expects to more than double in size to more than $250 billion.The combination of Microsoft's cloud assets with existing assets, including a large customer base and distribution channel, should help the company gain market share over the next three years, Morgan Stanley said. The bank highlighted Microsoft analytics, machine learning, productivity apps, front office apps and core financials as ways that Microsoft stands out from cloud giants Amazon and Google."

282,2018-03-22T07:04:15-0400," Microsoft describes deal as ""the single largest corporate purchase of solar energy ever in the United States."" Latest announcement follows two renewable energy deals in Singapore and India.  Microsoft is to purchase 315 megawatts (MW) of energy from two new solar facilities in Virginia, it said Wednesday.The tech giant will buy energy from the Pleinmont I and II sites in what it described as ""the single largest corporate purchase of solar energy ever in the United States."" The Pleinmont developments are part of a bigger 500 MW project owned and operated by sPower, an AES and AIMCo business. When operational, Pleinmont I and II will have over 750,000 solar panels covering more than 2,000 acres. ""This project is our second solar agreement in Virginia and allows our Virginia data centers to be powered fully by solar energy,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft's president, said in a statement Wednesday.Microsoft's total of directly purchased renewable energy now stands at around 1.2 gigawatts (GW). This, Smith said, was enough power to light 100 million LED bulbs.More than 10 GW of new solar photovoltaic capacity were installed in the U.S. in 2017, according to a recent report from GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association. Photovoltaic refers to a way of directly converting light from the sun into electricity.Virginia's governor, Ralph Northam, welcomed Wednesday's news. ""When companies like Microsoft invest in Virginia solar, they opt for clean and reliable energy as well as new jobs in the energy economy we are working hard to build,"" he said.Microsoft's latest announcement follows recent renewable energy deals in Asia. At the beginning of March, the company agreed to buy all the renewable energy output from a 60 MW solar project in Singapore, its first clean energy deal in Asia.

283,2018-03-17T16:03:20-0400," Facebook and YouTube have recently come under fire for offensive search suggestions. Microsoft made a Twitter chatbot in 2016 that was trained to say outrageous things by users, but Facebook and YouTube don't seem to have learned from the mistake. Psychological studies have shown that people are drawn to negative and offensive content, so engagement maximization drives the popularity of this content. Microsoft showed us in 2016 that it only takes hours for internet users to turn an innocent chatbot into a racist. Two years later, Facebook and YouTube haven't learned from that mistake.Facebook came under fire on Thursday night after users noticed search suggestions alluding to child abuse and other vulgar and upsetting results when people started typing ""video of..."" Facebook promptly apologized and removed the predictions.YouTube has also been the subject of investigations regarding how it highlights extreme content. On Monday, Youtube users highlighted the prevalence of conspiracy theories and extreme content in the website's autocomplete search box.Both companies blamed users for their search suggestion issues. Facebook told The Guardian, ""Facebook search predictions are representative of what people may be searching for on Facebook and are not necessarily reflective of actual content on the platform.""  Alphabet's Google, the owner of YouTube, says that its search results take into account ""popularity"" and ""freshness,"" which are determined by users.But this isn't the first time users have driven computer algorithms into unexpected and deeply offensive corners. Microsoft made the same mistake two years ago with a chatbot that learned how to be extremely offensive in less than a day.In March 2016,  Microsoft released a Twitter chatbot named ""Tay"" that was described as an experiment in ""conversational understanding."" The bot was supposed to learn to engage with people through ""casual and playful conversation.""But Twitter users engaged in conversation that wasn't so casual and playful. Within 24 hours, Tay was tweeting about racism, anti-semitism, dictators, and more. Part of it was prompted by users asking the bot to repeat after them, but soon the bot started saying strange and offensive things on its own. As a bot, Tay had no sense of ethics. Although Microsoft claimed the chatbot had been ""modeled, cleaned, and filtered,"" the filtering did not appear to be very effective, and the company soon pulled it and apologized for the offensive remarks.Without filters, anything goes and whatever maximizes engagement gets the attention of the bot and its followers. Unfortunately, hatred and negativity are great at driving engagement.The more shocking something is, the more likely people are to read it. Especially when platforms have little moderation and are optimized for maximum engagement.Twitter's well-documented spread of fake news is the poster child for this issue. The journal ""Science"" published a study this month looking at the pattern of the spread of misinformation on Twitte. The researchers found that falsehood diffused faster than the truth, and suggested that ""the degree of novelty and the emotional reactions of recipients may be responsible for the differences observed.""Psychologists have also studied why bad news appears to be more popular than good news. An experiment run at McGill University showed evidence of a ""negativity bias,"" a term for people's collective hunger for bad news. When you apply this to social media, it's easy to see how harmful content can easily end up in search results.The McGill scientists also found that most people believe they're better than average and expect things to be all right in the end. This pleasant view of the world makes bad news and offensive content more surprising and fun to see since everything's all right in the world anyway.When this gets amplified on a level of millions of people conducting searches each day, it brings the negative news to the forefront. People are drawn to the shocking news, it gets traction, more people search for it and then it reaches more people than it should have.Both Facebook and Google have hired human moderators to find and flag offensive content, but so far they haven't been able to keep up with the volume of new material uploaded, and the new ways that mischievous or malicious users try to ruin the experience for everybody else. Meanwhile, Microsoft recovered from the Tay debacle and released another chatbot called Zo in 2017. While Buzzfeed managed to get it to slip up and say offensive things , it's nothing on the order of what attackers were able to train Tay to say in just a few hours. Zo is still alive and well today, and largely inoffensive -- if not always on topic.Maybe it's time for Facebook and Google to give Microsoft Research a call and see if the reseachers there have any tips.

284,2018-03-15T11:21:55-0400,"Microsoft shipped its first video game in 1981, appropriately named Microsoft Adventure. It was an MS-DOS game that booted directly from a floppy disk, and set the stage for Microsoft's adventures in gaming. A lot has changed over the past 37 years, and when you think of Microsoft's efforts in gaming these days you'll immediately think of Xbox. It's fair to say a lot is about to change over the next few decades too, and Microsoft is getting ready. Today, the software giant is unveiling a new gaming cloud division that's ready for a future where consoles and gaming itself are very different to today.Microsoft has been building up to this move for a while. The company has been mysteriously acquiring gaming-related companies over the past few years. From  Havok in 2015,  Simplygon in 2017, to  PlayFab earlier this year, you've probably never heard of any of them, but they're important for Microsoft's bold cloud gaming ambitions. While these acquisitions have been taking place, Microsoft has been reshuffling its gaming teams as the company prepares to launch its own cloud gaming services. Phil Spencer is now Microsoft's head of gaming, and reports directly to CEO Satya Nadella. Microsoft's new gaming cloud division is headed up by Kareem Choudhry, a 20-year Microsoft veteran that has worked on Outlook, DirectX, and Xbox engineering.""Phil really wanted a dedicated team focused exclusively on the gaming cloud, says Choudhry, in an interview with The Verge. ""Those were conversations that started happening last summer, and we really started creating the structure of the organization at the end of last year."" The new division is designed to entice developers and game publishers to use Microsoft's cloud services. Ubisoft has been using Microsoft's Azure cloud services across PC, Xbox, and PS4 with Rainbow Six: Siege recently, and even the mobile game Black Desert uses Azure virtual machines and databases. Microsoft wants more and more game developers to use its cloud, especially as games become more connected across devices for their multiplayer experiences.""We believe there is going to be 2 billion gamers in the world, and our goal is to reach every one of them,"" explains Choudhry. Part of the way Microsoft will get there with its new gaming cloud focus is with subscription services. Xbox Game Pass has been available over the past year, and recently Microsoft decided all of its first-party games would come to the subscription service at launch.  Sea of Thieves is the first big title, but  future Halo and Gears of War games will also be available. ""We're really pleased with the success that's happening [with Game Pass],"" says Choudhry. ""We continue to believe in user choice, and we also believe there's room in the industry for a gaming subscription and that's what we're going to build.""Read more from The Verge:YouTube didn't tell Wikipedia about its plans for WikipediaAmazon and Twitch will start giving away free games for users to keepGoogle is opening up Maps so game developers can create the next Pokémon GoA ""Netflix for video games"" would be an important service for any company with cloud gaming aspirations, but it's going to be a difficult task for Microsoft on rival platforms like the PlayStation 4 or Nintendo's Switch. Despite the challenge, Choudhry hints that Microsoft could achieve this by streaming games to devices. ""We're looking at ways to make that content available to anyone no matter what device they're on,"" says Choudhry.It feels like every couple of years a new service springs to life, promising game streaming from powerful servers.  Sony acquired streaming games service OnLive only to shut it down, and  previously acquired Gaikai which eventually became part of its PlayStation Now game streaming service. Sony  discontinued game streaming to the PlayStation 3, PS Vista, PlayStation TV, and smart TVs and Blu-ray players last year, deciding to focus on PS4 and Windows PCs instead. Game streaming is a challenging service to get right, and even  Nvidia is trying its hand for PC games.Microsoft has  teased Xbox game streaming within three years, and it's clearly going to be big part of the new cloud gaming division. ""We're spending a lot of time thinking about that space,"" explains Choudhry. He says a ""bunch of things"" need to come together, including making a business model that's attractive to third parties. ""What we're doing with game pass and creating a subscription-based product, where over half the content is third-party content. I would say we're getting started from a subscription product perspective.""Microsoft's new cloud gaming division is only just getting started on a number of these efforts, and the real test will be whether developers and game publishers are interested in using the company's tools, distribution methods, and ultimately a game streaming service.

The Nasdaq lost another 1.7 percent in midday trading Friday.With shares of the FAANGs down by an average of 25.6 percent since the start of the quarter, fund managers and analysts are starting to reconsider their approach to growth, treating the FAANG stocks less like a single bloc and more on their individual merits.""This was a year when at the start of it you had to own the FAANG names and at the end of it you don't want to own any of them,"" said Kevin Landis, portfolio manager at the Firsthand Technology Opportunities fund.Landis, who has been trimming his position in Apple yet still holds Amazon.com and Alphabet among his 10 largest positions, said that the FAANG group is breaking down as the companies mature and their growth plateaus.As a result, he is trimming his position in Netflix and instead adding to his position in streaming television company Roku Inc, which has a market value of approximately $3.3 billion, compared with Netflix's market value of $116.3 billion.""It's hard to see Netflix growing here by an order of magnitude, but it's easy to see Roku growing by an order of magnitude as the cord-cutting trend picks up steam,"" he said.FAANG FUNDAMENTALSThere are still things to like about each FAANG stock, of course. Netflix surprised analysts with its subscriber growth in its most recent quarter, for instance, while Facebook is continuing to grow quickly overseas and Amazon's profitability came in higher than Wall Street had predicted.Yet each company is also facing hurdles that belie the notion that they will continue to dominate the stock market. Netflix, for instance, is trying to weather a faster cash burn rate as the cost of content increases, while revenue growth for Google's search and YouTube advertising is slowing amid stronger competition from Amazon.Facebook is facing higher costs and greater regulatory scrutiny, while Apple grapples with a slower-growing market for smart phones and Amazon is weighed down by higher spending costs.It's been a ""slow motion train wreck,"" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities.The steep slide in the stock market will likely break apart the popularity of investing in the stocks as a single trade, he said. ""Facebook has almost daily scandals and Netflix has the impending loss of Disney/Fox content, but the others have really done nothing wrong at all,"" he said.Tom Plumb, portfolio manager of the Plumb Equity fund, said that he has largely stayed away from the crowded FAANG stock trade because of their high valuations. Yet of the group, he expects that Facebook is the least likely to rebound quickly, cracking the group further.""Companies that have depended on the social media advertising are going to see some incredible regulatory scrutiny and I'd like to see a couple more quarters at least to see how they've adjusted their business models"" before buying their shares, he said.Instead, he is increasing his position in companies with strong recurring revenue streams such as Adobe Inc, Visa Inc, and Microsoft Corp.""You don't get to buy companies at panic prices unless there's a panic, and I think there's an incredible amount of anxiety in the market right now,"" he said.

With constant news about data breaches, the public's trust in big tech has taken a big hit this past year.

This gives Microsoft's notebook a leg up over Apple's MacBook products. Microsoft's Surface Pro with LTE is available for order now and ships by May 1. Microsoft launched a new model of its Surface Pro laptop on Tuesday with an edge over Apple's MacBook products, particularly for business users.The new version of the Surface Pro now has built-in LTE connectivity, which means users can stay connected wherever there's a cellular signal, the same sort used by your smartphone. Previously, Microsoft sold only Wi-Fi models of the Surface Pro. Apple's MacBooks don't support LTE connections, though its iPads are available with that option.This gives Microsoft an edge for business users who need constant connectivity where Wi-Fi isn't available, like in airports where the signal can be bad. To play devil's advocate, folks who pay for a Wi-Fi hotspot on their smartphones can also ""tether"" and share the same connection as their phone.You can use the Surface Pro LTE with the carrier of your choice, including Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile and Sprint in the United States.The Verge recently reviewed the new Surface Pro with LTE and gave it high marks for all-day battery life but noted that the processor is outdated compared with newer PCs.The LTE-model of Microsoft's Surface Pro starts at $1,149 with an Intel Core i5 processor and 4GB of RAM. If you can splurge, you're probably better off buying the model with 8GB of RAM and twice the storage (256GB) for $1,449. You'll need to pay an additional $99 for a keyboard for either model.

The case began with a 2013 warrant obtained by prosecutors for emails of a suspect in a drug trafficking investigation that were stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin. A major privacy rights fight between Microsoft and the Justice Department reaches the Supreme Court this week, with the justices considering whether U.S. law allows prosecutors to compel technology companies to hand over data stored overseas.The nine justices will hear arguments on Tuesday in a case that pits the interests of tech companies and privacy advocates in safeguarding customer data against the demands of law enforcement in obtaining information crucial to criminal and counterterrorism investigations.The case began with a 2013 warrant obtained by prosecutors for emails of a suspect in a drug trafficking investigation that were stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin. The company challenged whether a domestic warrant covered data stored abroad. The Justice Department said because Microsoft is based in the United States, prosecutors were entitled to the data.The case is being closely watched by other countries wrestling with similar concerns, including members of the European Union. A ruling is due by the end of June.A 2016 decision by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals siding with Microsoft marked a victory for tech firms that increasingly offer cloud computing services in which data is stored remotely. President Donald Trump's administration appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court.Globally dominant American tech companies have expressed concern that customers will go elsewhere if they think the U.S. government's reach extends to data centers all around the world without changes being made to the law.Microsoft, which has 100 data centers in 40 countries, was the first American company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the United States.Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, told reporters last week the U.S. government should not be able to act unilaterally to access such data without taking into account the laws and interests of other countries.""It's more likely to be a recipe for international tension and chaos,"" Smith said.Solicitor General Noel Francisco, the administration's top lawyer in Supreme Court cases, said in court papers that a ruling for Microsoft ""would hamper domestic law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts.""If the Supreme Court were to rule in favor of Microsoft, the government could still gain access data held overseas, but the process would be more cumbersome and potentially take longer.Lawmakers are considering making changes to the 1986 law.Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in Congress to update the statute, a move backed by both Microsoft and the administration. The measure would let U.S. judges issue warrants while giving companies an avenue to object if the request conflicts with foreign law. If Congress were to pass the bill before the Supreme Court rules, the case would likely become moot.Though Microsoft is based in the United States — Redmond, Washington, to be precise — the appeals court said the emails were beyond the reach of domestic search warrants obtained under a 1986 U.S. law called the Stored Communications Act.The Microsoft customer whose emails were sought told the company he was based in Ireland when he signed up for his account.Other companies including IBM, Amazon.com, Apple, Verizon Communications, and Alphabet's Google filed court papers backing Microsoft. Google has mounted challenges similar to Microsoft's.The administration has the support of 35 states led by Vermont who say they routinely seek access to data stored overseas, especially in cases involving child pornography.Several foreign governments, including Ireland and Britain, filed court papers raising concerns about the U.S. government's position.Ireland's government said in its brief that the question of how law enforcement authorities can access such information is already covered by a 2001 treaty with the United States that allows for information sharing and enforcement of court orders.The treaty's procedures ""represent the most appropriate means to address requests such as those which are the object of the warrant in question,"" Ireland's brief said.The European Commission, representing the 28-country European Union, filed a brief saying that when a country is seeking data from outside its jurisdiction ""the interests and laws of that foreign jurisdiction must be taken into account.""The Supreme Court has ruled twice in recent years in major cases concerning how criminal law applies to new technology, both times ruling against law enforcement. In 2012, the court held that a warrant is required to place a GPS tracking device on a vehicle. In 2014, the court ruled that police need a warrant to search a cellphone seized during an arrest.In the court's current term, which ends in June, the justices are due to rule on another privacy issue on whether police need search warrants to access cellphone location information held by wireless carriers. Based on the Nov. 29 oral argument, the justices appear likely to rule against law enforcement again."

Here's how Weiner portrayed the change during the talk: We're starting to gain some traction with what we call the Talent Solutions Enterprise Program, which has revisited our business model and has broadened the potential addressable opportunity within the customers already served, who may have said that they didn't necessarily have the budget to reach their entire force of recruiters and sourcers and hiring managers -- that they were purchasing products, pretty high-ticket item, for the people who use us most intensively. But we knew that everyone within the organization who is related to that process could benefit through the tool. Weiner, who joined Microsoft's senior leadership team as part of the $26.2 billion acquisition in 2016, said the program has led to positive results for the group:""And so we went back to the drawing board and thought through that business model and are now able to effectively reduce the cost per seat or cost per user while materially expanding the footprint within the organization, and the net result is more budget being allocated to LinkedIn,"" he said.In other words, by lowering the cost per user, LinkedIn found that companies are buying access for more users, and thereby increasing the overall amount of money they're spending with the company.Microsoft executives repeatedly called out LinkedIn growth on its fiscal second-quarter earnings call last month.LinkedIn has now seen revenue acceleration three quarters in a row, Weiner said."
300,2018-02-14T18:52:37-0500," Amazon's closing market value surpassed Microsoft for the first time on Wednesday. That puts Amazon behind only Apple and Alphabet among public companies. Amazon shares closed at $1,451.05, giving the company a market cap of $702.5 billion.  Amazon is now worth more than Microsoft. Amazon's market value — its closing share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding — rose to $702.5 billion on Wednesday, and for the first time passed Microsoft, which is worth $699.2 billion as of the close of trading.Only Apple and Alphabet are now ahead of Amazon among the most valuable companies in the world. Microsoft is fourth, followed by China's Tencent and Facebook, as the six biggest companies by market cap all come from the technology industry. Amazon climbed 2.6 percent on Wednesday to $1451.05, while Microsoft rose 1.6 percent to $90.81. With Amazon's 73 percent surge over the past year, CEO Jeff Bezos has become the world's richestperson, surpassing — you guessed it — Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Still, Microsoft shares have notched a 41 percent rally in the past 12 months and the software maker remains flush with cash.The two companies come from very different places, with Amazon dominating e-commerce and Microsoft owning the desktop. But they're now going head to head in cloud infrastructure, where Amazon's big early lead is generating plenty of excitement on Wall Street."

He praised Apple for delivering new software updates every 12 to 18 months for 20 years, as well as for disrupting his former company's claim to fame, the PC. Former Microsoft executive Steven Sinofsky took to Twitter on Monday to defend Apple after a report emerged detailing changes to the tech company's software development and release schedule.""Scanning the landscape, it is important to recognize that in total the work Apple has been doing across hardware, software, services, and even AI/ML — in total — is breathtaking and unprecedented in scope, scale, and quality,"" Sinofsky wrote on the social media network.""Few companies have done so much for so long with such a high level of consistency,"" he added.@stevesi tweetApple software chief Craig Federighi reportedly informed engineers about new scheduling changes that will impact the rollout of the next iOS operating system this fall, according to a Bloomberg report. The changes would give them more time to work on new features and refinements, without the added burden of completing a laundry list of yearly tasks. The changes will also ensure certain key features won't be available.The report argued these adjustments are Apple's response to missed deadlines and increasingly buggy products.Sinofsky, who oversaw Windows at Microsoft from 2009 to 2012 and Office for many years before that, jumped to Apple's defense in a 44-part Twitter rant. Sinofsky described from experience the ""Catch-22"" of software innovation: balancing features, scheduling and quality. Apple, he emphasized, has been delivering on that for 20 years.""What is lost in all of this recent discussion is the nuance between features, schedule, and quality. It is like having a discussion with a financial advisor over income, risk, and growth. You don't just show up and say you want all three and get a 'sure,'"" Sinofsky tweeted.""On the other hand, this is precisely what Apple did so reliably over 20 years. But behind the scenes there is a constant discussion over balancing these three legs of the tripod. You have to have all of them but you 'can't' but you have to,"" he added.He explained the changes as a scaling adjustment, nothing ""more dramatic than that,"" and wrote went on to praised Apple for disrupting his former company's claim to fame, the PC. ""...to me on Apple, even as an outsider, I feel confident saying that this isn't reactionary/crisis or a response to externalities. Importantly it isn't a massive pivot/'student body left'. It's a methodical and predictable evolution of an extremely robust and proven system,"" he wrote.The thread starts here:Tweet"

303,2015-10-01T03:26:46-0400,"Microsoft Corp and Google have agreed to bury all patent infringement litigation against each other, the companies announced on Wednesday, settling 18 cases in the United States and Germany.In another sign of the winding down of the global smartphone wars, the companies said the deal puts an end to court fights involving a variety of technologies, including mobile phones, wifi, and patents used in Microsoft's Xbox game consoles and other Windows products.  The agreement also drops all litigation involving Motorola Mobility, which Google sold to Lenovo Group last year while keeping its patents.   However, as Microsoft and Google continue to make products that compete directly with each other, including search engines and mobile computing devices, the agreement notably does not preclude any future infringement lawsuits, a Microsoft spokeswoman confirmed.   ""Google and Microsoft have agreed to collaborate on certain patent matters and anticipate working together in other areas in the future to benefit our customers,"" the companies said in a joint statement. They did not disclose the financial terms of the deal.   The companies said they have been cooperating on such issues as the development of a unified patent court for the European Union, and on royalty-free technology for speeding up video on the Internet.   One of the most bitter disputes between the rivals began in 2010 when Microsoft accused Motorola, later acquired by Mountain View, California-based Google, of breaching its obligation to offer licenses to its wireless and video patents used in Xbox systems at a reasonable cost.   In July, a U.S. appeals court ruled that the low licensing rate Microsoft pays to use the patents had been properly set by a federal judge in Seattle.   Wednesday's agreement is not the first among smartphone heavyweights to settle their patent disputes. In 2014, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple Inc agreed to drop all litigation against one another outside the United States. "
304,2018-02-28T08:08:03-0500," Machine learning has a lot of promise, but it's still far from being used in routine clinical practice. Ochsner Health System in Louisiana has been piloting a new technology tool for predicting a specific kind of medical emergency, before it's too late. It aims to put this tool to work today. Have you ever seen a medical TV show where a group of doctors will rush over to a ""coding"" patient whose heart has stopped while dramatic music plays?This race against the clock happens quite often in real life. And many times, the resuscitation attempt isn't enough.So one hospital group, Ochsner Health System in New Orleans, has been working with Epic, the company that makes its medical record software, and Microsoft's cloud service Azure, to figure out whether technology can pinpoint which patients are likely to code, well before a cardiac or respiratory arrest. Ochsner's team has been piloting the tool in the past three months, looking at whether various signals from a patient are likely to result in the kind of rapid deterioration that results in a code.These data points are things like dropping blood pressure, a rising heart rate, a changing value in the blood work, or some combination of the above, as well as demographic factors like age and the patient's medical history.That's more data than a human doctor could juggle on her own, said Dr. Richard Milani, Ochsner's chief clinical transformation officer. And the existing tools, he said, are no more sophisticated than the tools that are used to figure out credit scores, which have a high rate of false negatives and positives.That means some flagged patients are perfectly fine, while others slip through the cracks.""It's all these very nuanced little things that when added together are bigger than the sum of their parts,"" he told CNBC in a phone interview.It can take time for companies to collect and analyze all of this data. But that's starting to change as more hospitals form alliances with technology companies, which include data-sharing agreements.The three organizations plan to publish the results in a study and share them with the broader medical community.The data from the pilot is still being assessed, said Milani, but he added that the number of codes, meaning emergencies that require immediate resuscitation of the patient, dropped by 44 percent outside of the intensive care unit.The hope is that other hospitals will follow suit once the data gets published. One potential stumbling block, however, is training health providers to prevent codes using this kind of data, rather than waiting to respond to them. Milani said the plan is to deploy the tool in all of its hospitals, with an ultimate goal of eliminating codes among floor patients. Ochsner's network has 30 hospitals and more than 80 health centers.""This isn't just about an algorithm,"" said Seth Hain, Epic's director of analytics and machine learning. ""It's really about the opportunity that all health organizations have to put machine learning into practice."""
305,2018-02-07T11:21:35-0500,"Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on Wednesday that technology companies need to accept that their design choices help create both the good and bad of artificial intelligence technology. ""I feel like sometimes we in tech, even, abdicate control: '[AI] is going to happen tomorrow and our best case is that we're going to be domesticated cats or whatever.'  But no, it's a choice. I'm not making fun of that as a consequence. It could happen, but only if we abdicate,"" Nadella said.Nadella spoke on Wednesday at The Economic Club of New York, a nonpartisan organization that offers individual membership to top business thinkers. He said it's not enough for CEOs to lament the future of robots keeping humans as house cats — parroting comments by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and former Apple CEO Steve Wozniak. There are empowering AI tools that help people that are visually impaired, dyslexic and have cerebral palsy, Nadella said. ""But that doesn't mean the unintended consequences of automation — displacement — are not going to be real as well,"" Nadella said. ""So therefore, we as a society — starting with Microsoft — have to do some of our very best work at skilling .... students in school or people who are displaced midcareer.""Nadella said that the most successful companies he partners with don't see technology as something that's just on the sidelines. He said that takes more than just opening an office in Silicon Valley.""The auto industry has gone through a fundamental transformation,"" Nadella said. ""Computers will look like ancient machines compared to these cars. We have had to show up with that trusted partnership relationship and technology, recognizing that they are going to build technology.... Pick your partners that you can have long-term stable trust, because everyone needs leverage in this world. ""Nadella alluded to recent widespread security issues Spectre and Meltdown as an example of the integration.""The environment we live in, where the threat vectors are everywhere, one foundational thing we have to do as — I think of us as first responders — is to build products that are more secure,"" Nadella said. ""[But] we have to realize that fundamental security does not just come with building secure products, it's from the operational posture. You can't be fit by just having fitness equipment, you've got to actually exercise."" Since taking over at Microsoft, Nadella has refocused the company on high-growth cloud services like Azure and Office 365, and has made splashy acquisitions, like LinkedIn and Minecraft. In his book, he calls it rediscovering ""Microsoft's soul."" But Nadella's recent calls for more empathy in tech come amid tension between Silicon Valley and the rest of the country. Washington-based Microsoft and Amazon, alongside California's Apple, Alphabet and Facebook, have all faced criticism for their apparent dominance. Culture is a ""core enabler of a successful company,"" allowing Microsoft to invest in innovation and take risks. The challenge he said, was convincing Microsoft's hardcore, analytic engineers to see culture as more than an extension of the founder, or a poster in a conference room."

The promotion comes a month after reports that Dropbox has filed confidentially to go public. Microsoft is trying to lure users of cloud services from Box, Dropbox and Alphabet's Google Drive by giving them its competitive product for free.On Tuesday, Microsoft said users of those three file sync and sharing services can switch to OneDrive for Business without paying anything until their current contract expires. Microsoft is only running the offer for the next five months, according to a blog post from Ron Markezich, a corporate vice president.The promotion is further proof of Microsoft's commitment to building its Office 365 lineup of cloud productivity services, including OneDrive for Business. Organizations are only eligible if they're not already OneDrive for Business or Office 365 customers, and if deployments will reach at least 500 users, Markezich wrote.Microsoft's offer comes a month after reports that Dropbox has filed confidentially to go public. And last week, Alphabet announced that G Suite, which includes Google Drive, has 4 million paying customers. More than 350,000 organizations currently have OneDrive, Markezich wrote. Commercial subscriptions to Office 365 represent a key portion of Microsoft's commercial cloud, which generated $5.3 billion in revenue in the latest quarter, up 56 percent from the prior year. Continuing growth of Office 365 commercial revenue was assumed in a recent prediction by Evercore ISI analysts that Microsoft could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2020.It's not the first time Microsoft has given away technology to attract business.

But apparent bargains could turn out to be expensive if earnings expectations take a turn for the worse next year as the United States continues its trade dispute with China.Since Apple's November forecast for a weaker-than-expected holiday shopping quarter and other reports of sluggish demand for iPhones, analysts have cut estimates for the Cupertino, California-based company's December-quarter net income by almost $1 billion. Apple's stock last week traded at a nearly two-year low of 13 times expected earnings, even after accounting for analysts' reduced expectations.Already, the so-called FANG group of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google-parent Alphabet shares has seen its weight within the S&amp;P 500 dwindle to 8 percent from as much as 10 percent in July, with investors fleeing what for years was Wall Street's most popular trade.Since the U.S. stock market abruptly dropped in early October, Apple has lost a quarter of its value, and last week it relinquished its title as Wall Street's most valuable company to Microsoft Corp. Since then, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon have been battling to be No. 1.Netflix has slumped 20 percent since early October, while Facebook and Amazon are both down over 10 percent. Alphabet, the least badly performing of the group, has lost 9 percent, a little worse than the S&amp;P 500's 8 percent decline.Investors in recent months have become increasingly worried that an ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict may hobble U.S. multinationals just as a year-long an surge in earnings growth caused by new corporate tax cuts is set to end.Tech investors have also become more concerned about a global smartphone market that is losing steam, but the resulting drop in Apple's stock has outpaced analysts' reduced earnings expectations. Apple and other big tech names are trading at the lowest multiples of their prices to expected earnings in years, suggesting recent selling might be overdone.""There are some attractive buying opportunities,"" said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""We are buying Microsoft, and we could add some Apple and some Alphabet at these levels.""Facebook, plagued for months by criticism of its use of people's personal data and fears that it could face more regulation, recently traded at 19 times expected earnings, its lowest ever. That compares to a multiple of 45 times after Facebook went public in 2012.Amazon's stock is now trading at 64 times expected earnings, it lowest multiple since 2012. Netflix's price/earnings multiple has dropped to 68, its lowest since 2015.Newly enacted corporate tax cuts supercharged U.S. earnings this year, but their effect on profit growth will end in the December quarter, leading analysts on average to predict S&amp;P 500 earnings per share next year will rise 8 percent, compared to 24 percent in 2018, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.""The question going into 2019 is, 'Are you seeing enough of a pullback in those sectors that led that would entice investors to accept the lower valuations as an opportunity?""' said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Additional reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch in New York; Editing by Richard Chang)"
310,2018-01-31T15:31:05-0500," Microsoft beat expectations on earnings and revenue. The company expects a 16 percent effective tax rate, plus or minus 2 percent, in the second half of the fiscal year.  Microsoft's Azure cloud had 98 percent revenue growth in the quarter, with compute usage more than doubling. Microsoft stock fell by more than 2 percent immediately after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of its 2018 fiscal year -- which ended on December 31 -- after the bell on Wednesday. After the company's conference call with analysts, the stock was trading about 0.3 percent above the $95.01 closing price. Earnings: 96 cents per share, vs. 86 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $28.92 billion, vs. $28.40 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. There was a $13.8 billion one-time accounting charge for Microsoft in the quarter as a result of recent changes to the U.S. tax code.But overall, Microsoft's revenue was up 12 percent year over year, according to Wednesday's earnings statement. Microsoft's biggest business segment, More Personal Computing, which includes Windows, devices, gaming and search advertising, grew 2 percent, with $12.17 billion in revenue. That's above the FactSet consensus estimate of $12.02 billion in revenue for More Personal Computing.Gaming revenue for the quarter was up 8 percent, thanks to the new availability of Microsoft's Xbox One X gaming console.The Productivity and Business Processes segment, including Office, Dynamics and LinkedIn, increased by 25 percent with revenue of $8.95 billion, above the $8.86 billion FactSet estimate. And the Intelligent Cloud business, which contains Azure, Windows Server and SQL Server, produced $7.80 billion in revenue, giving it a 15 percent growth rate. That's above FactSet's $7.51 billion estimate for the segment.In Wednesday's statement Microsoft, as usual, didn't specify how much revenue Azure brought in, but it did provide a growth rate. Azure's revenue was up by 98 percent in the quarter, and compute usage more than doubled. In the quarter Microsoft's Azure public cloud gained share from market leader Amazon Web Services, KeyBanc analysts estimated earlier this month.Microsoft expects to have $25.25-25.95 billion in revenue in its fiscal third quarter, and that midpoint is just a bit higher than the Thomson Reuters analyst estimate.And tax changes should result in a 16 percent effective tax rate, plus or minus 2 percent, in the fiscal second half of 2018, CFO Amy Hood said on Wednesday's conference call. In Microsoft's fiscal first quarter, the rate was 18 percent. The company expects to have an effective tax rate ""slightly below"" the new 21 percent corporate rate in its 2019 fiscal year, Hood said. In the weeks leading up to the earnings report, some analysts were suggesting that decreases in the effective tax rate could lead to gains in Microsoft's earnings per share.In a Jan. 28 note the KeyBanc analysts said they were expecting Microsoft to report a $21.8 billion annualized revenue run rate -- the final month of the quarter, multiplied by 12 -- for Commercial Cloud, which includes Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics 365, which would imply 50 percent growth. For the second quarter Microsoft did not report annualized revenue run rate for commercial cloud.But Microsoft did say that in the fiscal second quarter it picked up commercial cloud revenue totaling $5.3 billion, which was up 56 percent year over year, and up sequentially from $5 billion in the fiscal first quarter. The gross margin for commercial cloud in the quarter was 55 percent, up from 48 percent for the same period last year; Microsoft said that gain was driven by Azure and Office 365.Microsoft said its number of Office 365 consumer subscribers increased to 29.2 million, up from 28 million one quarter earlier.And the company addressed the recent Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities in the risk factors section of its regulatory filing: As illustrated by the recent Spectre and Meltdown threats, our products operate in conjunction with and are dependent on products and components across a broad ecosystem. If there is a security vulnerability in one of these components, and if there is a security exploit targeting it, we could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, or harm to our reputation or competitive position. Microsoft stock is up around 10 percent since the beginning of the year.

313,2019-01-15T07:09:00-0500,"NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - While growing up in Seattle, Enrique Rico's mom cleaned the posh homes of Microsoft employees. When Rico tagged along on sick days from school, he dreamed of having the life of a technology worker.Now, at 26, with no college degree or background in STEM, Rico is working a developer at Avvo, an online marketplace for legal services.He is a graduate of a program called Apprenti that provides education and on-the-job training for tech jobs to non-traditional recruits.""I never really thought I could do it. But once I dug deep, I gave it my all,"" said Rico.The Apprenti program is run by the Washington Technology Industry Association in partnership with the U.S. Department of Labor. It operates at around 50 companies nationwide with major employers including Microsoft, Amazon.com and JPMorgan Chase.During the first year of the program in 2017, 76 candidates went through the training, which includes about 400 to 780 classroom hours on the front end, compressed into 12 weeks.After a year of on-the-job training, the program will finish 2018 with 330 graduates placed into full-time jobs. The class of 2019 is on track to produce more than 700 graduates.Amazon expects its apprenticeship cohort to grow from 150 to 1,000 workers in the next few years, said Tammy Thieman, a senior program manager at the ecommerce giant.The tech industry had 2.8 million openings last year, with 50 percent of them middle-level jobs that do not necessarily require a college degree, according to Jennifer Carlson, executive director of Apprenti.The pace of hiring is lagging, however, because companies cannot find properly trained workers, she said.""This industry needed technical competency at the start - that's a paradigm shift from traditional apprenticeships,"" Carlson added.Apprenti focuses on veterans, women and under-represented minorities, screening about 2,000 candidates to find 700 candidates for 2019.Amazon teamed up with Apprenti after its CEO Jeff Bezos made a commitment in 2016 to hire 25,000 veterans and military spouses by 2021. But the apprenticeship program quickly broadened to find qualified workers for a vast swath of open jobs that required specific credentials.""It is not at all unrealistic that freshman going to college today come out already behind,"" said Amazon's Thieman. ""An apprenticeship offers a model to do the learning in a compressed way and then learn the skills on the job.While veterans often have valuable skills, they usually do not have a conventional resume or workplace experience. That is why the biggest challenge currently for veterans is being underemployed when they leave the armed forces, said Chris Newsome, vice president of candidate aggregation at RecruitMilitary.""A lot of these men and women are able to find jobs, but not necessarily careers,"" Newsome said.New college graduates often will need to complete a program like Apprenti to be job-ready because programming languages and platforms change so quickly.Training at universities or even specialty classes at community colleges also do not quite stack up when it comes to hiring for a role such as cloud administrators which require specific certificates, Apprenti's Carlson said.Even boot camps for coding do not necessarily do the trick. Rico tried that route first, quitting his $16.50-an-hour job as a salesperson at an Apple Store to go into a coding program.But without a college degree, he did not stand much of a chance against the automated interfaces most big tech companies use to sort through applicants when hiring.DIVERSITY BOOSTFor smaller companies like Avvo, Apprenti is more of a mission.""The executives saw the value of a program that gets you talented engineers and does a social good,"" said Hunter Davis, director of engineering at Avvo.The company has about 25-30 developers currently on staff, with about 15 percent of them coming through Apprenti.""They are awesome and full of grit and willing to learn,"" Davis said.The leg up for Apprenti grads starts right away. Like Rico, many were previously working minimum wage jobs, with a median income of $28,000 and most without benefits. The starting salary in the Apprenti program is $45,000 during training.At six months when candidates begin their on-the-job training, the salary rises $51,000. If they get hired full-time - and almost all of them do - Apprenti grads make at least $75,000.That is a life-changing salary for most of the participants.""I have an apartment and a dog and a cat,"" said Rico, who is still dreaming. ""Id love to get married and have kids and buy a house. I want to be my own boss. I would love to start my own company.""(Editing by Lauren Young and G Crosse)"
314,2018-01-25T09:21:00-0500," Some of the biggest public companies, including Google, Microsoft, Ford and Merck, are opting to work with, rather than against, some of Silicon Valley's most innovative start-ups. These include education tech company Coursera, WeWork, Lyft and Moderna Therapeutics. The companies featured on CNBC's annual Disruptor 50 list often threaten the establishment and are on their way to becoming the next generation of giants. But increasingly, the largest public companies are partnering with CNBC Disruptors to speed up their own pace of innovation.Just last week education technology company Coursera announced a new partnership with Alphabet's Google to train IT professionals. Google is granting 10,000 scholarships to Coursera's online program to help meet the growing demand for tech support specialists. And Google is just the latest company to turn to Coursera to help educate their workforce. More than 500 businesses, including IBM and Intel, have partnered with Coursera to put their content on the platform and to help train their own employees.Microsoft is expanding its relationship with WeWork as it looks to give employees options about where they work. In 2016, Microsoft moved 300 of its New York City employees — along with other members of its sales team — to WeWork offices in Atlanta, Portland and Philadelphia.In New York, Microsoft employees have access to 30 different buildings throughout the city and can book space for work or private conference rooms for meetings. Microsoft says after finding 92 percent employee satisfaction, they're extending the partnership with WeWork internationally, with agreements in London and cities in Australia, Israel, India and South Korea. Microsoft says the partnership now includes engineering employees as well as those on the sales team, with more than 1,000 memberships to WeWork.In the auto space, Ford is betting on Lyft. In September, Ford announced it is teaming up with Lyft on self-driving cars, working to launch Ford autonomous vehicles in Lyft's network by 2021. GM already had invested $500 million in Lyft in 2016.For pharmaceutical companies, disruptors can accelerate the pace of drug development. Moderna Therapeutics has two big pharmaceutical partnerships to bring its products to market. It's working with Merck to develop RNA-based vaccines and immunity therapies and with AstraZeneca on a range of therapeutic treatments for a number of cancers. The idea is to leverage both Moderna and its partners' areas of expertise: Moderna leads the preclinical development, AstraZeneca then takes over early clinical development, and the two companies share the profits of product sales.Finally, there's Quid, which was a newcomer on the 2017 Disruptor 50 list. Asset manager Salient Partners uses Quid's A.I. platform to drive the decision-making of its traders. Quid specializes in text-based data analysis, analyzing millions of documents, such as Amazon product reviews or news headlines. Salient uses Quid to understand how much the markets will be rattled by, say, the vote for Brexit.Which start-ups will create the next wave of innovations that attract the attention of the public market's prominent players?

315,2018-01-22T05:52:50-0500," Two of Microsoft's distributors in Russia have imposed restrictions on sales of Microsoft software to more than 200 Russian companies. The move follows new U.S. sanctions, according to notifications circulated by the distributors. Two of Microsoft's official distributors in Russia have imposed restrictions on sales of Microsoft software to more than 200 Russian companies following new U.S. sanctions, according to notifications circulated by the distributors.While much of the focus around U.S. sanctions has been on ways they are being skirted, the moves by the Russian distributors show how tougher restrictions that came into force on Nov. 28 are starting to bite.The new measures cut the duration of loans that can be offered to Russian financial firms subject to sanctions to 14 days from 30 days and to 60 days from 90 days for Russian energy companies on a U.S. sanctions list.Previously, the restrictions had mainly affected Western banks lending to Russian firms but with such short financing periods, swathes of companies supplying goods and services to Russian clients fear they could fall foul of the rules too.It is routine in Russia for suppliers to wait weeks or even months to get paid after submitting invoices for goods and services.Some Western firms have been advised by lawyers that the U.S. Treasury Department could, in theory, take the view this constituted financing in violation of the sanctions, according to several people involved in the discussions.One of the two Microsoft distributors, a Russian company called Merlion, said in its notification to partners that all sanctioned buyers of Microsoft licenses must pay within tight deadlines, or even pay upfront in some cases.The second distributor, RRC, said in its notification, seen by Reuters, that ""serious restrictions are being introduced"" on Microsoft orders from firms subject to U.S. sanctions.Both Merlion and RRC cited rules stemming from the new package of U.S. sanctions — signed into law on Aug. 2 for Russia's involvement in Ukraine and cyberattacks — as the reason for the additional restrictions.Neither Merlion nor RRC responded to Reuters questions.Microsoft said in a statement to Reuters: ""Microsoft has a strong commitment to complying with legal requirements and has robust processes around the world to help ensure that our partners are in compliance as well.""In response to Reuters questions, a spokesman for the U.S. Treasury Department, which oversees the enforcement of sanctions, referred to its published guidance.The guidance from the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) states that U.S. firms can conduct transactions with companies on the sanctions list as long as the payment terms do not exceed the permitted loan duration.""In the event that a U.S. person believes that it may not receive payment in full by the end of the relevant payment period, the U.S. person should contact OFAC to determine whether a license or other authorization is required,"" it said.The United States can impose a civil penalty on violators of $250,000 or double the amount of the offending transaction if it is greater. If convicted of willful violation, offenders face a fine up to $1 million, or 20 years in jail, or both.Microsoft did not respond to Reuters questions about whether it had initiated the restrictions introduced by two of its Russian distributors.Microsoft lists nine other official distributors of its main software products in Russia in the same category of partner companies as RRC and Merlion. One, Softline, declined to comment on whether it had introduced stricter payment rules. The others did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.Reuters reported in October that software produced by Microsoft had been acquired by state organizations and firms in Russia and Crimea, despite sanctions barring U.S.-based companies from doing business with them.That case, and several similar ones reported by Reuters, highlighted gaps between the sanctions and their enforcement.The U.S. government operates two lists of firms subject to sanctions. U.S.-based entities are banned from doing almost all forms of business with firms on Washington's Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list.A second list known as the Sectoral Sanctions Identifications (SSI) list covers 224 mostly Russian firms and their subsidiaries in the banking, energy and defense sectors which are subject to financial restrictions.They include major Russian companies such as oil giant Rosneft, natural gas producer Novatek and Sberbank, Russia's biggest lender.While the lending rules for financial and energy firms have been tightened, restrictions on financing for Russian defense manufacturers were left unchanged at 30 days though the new sanctions toughened the penalties for any violations.The notification from Microsoft distributor Merlion dated Nov. 29, the day after the new lending rules come into force, said orders would only be fulfilled for financial sector buyers once it had confirmation full payment had been received.For the defense sector, it said orders would be fulfilled only if partners confirmed payment would be made within 30 days of the software license being activated. For energy sector clients, confirmation of payment within 60 days was required.""If we do not receive from you documents confirming payment on orders from the defense and energy sectors, the order could be viewed by the vendor as not complying with the processing procedure and rejected,"" Merlion's notification said.RRC did not spell out the new restrictions in its notification, sent by email last month to its partners.""In the event that you have buyers from the following sectors of the economy (financial, defense, energy) and they are in the sanctions list, you are requested IN ADVANCE to contact your RRC manager for further instructions.""""In connection with this, serious restrictions are being introduced on the placing of, and payment for, orders for Microsoft products ... placed by these buyers (and also their subsidiaries and affiliated companies),"" the notification said.Besides the tighter lending rules and other new restrictions, a change of wording in the U.S. sanctions package is also sending ripples through the Russian economy.The previous wording was the U.S. president ""may impose"" penalties if rules are violated. That has now changed to ""shall impose"" penalties, unless it is not in the national interest.Lawyers who advise clients on U.S. sanctions compliance said this meant it was more likely Washington would impose penalties on foreign entities doing prohibited business with a company on the sanctions list.In response, companies are trying to put as much distance as possible between themselves and Russian entities on the U.S. blacklist, fearing they could end up on it too by association, bankers, lawyers, officials, and business executives said.Some companies are conducting audits to find out if their partners deal with any sanctioned entities and are, in some cases, halting those relationships, according to a sanctions lawyer and an executive with a large industrial firm.""Even Chinese companies started to ask,"" said a senior source close to the Kremlin and the Russian government, alluding to the fact some Chinese companies have until now continued to do deals even where many Western firms have pulled back.At the same time, companies that are on the sanctions list, or believe they may be added, are looking for intermediary firms that would allow their partners to keep working with them, albeit at arm's length.A person who works closely with a billionaire Russian oligarch said he assessed the risk the oligarch's business would be put under U.S. sanctions was only 10 percent. Even so, he said, the business was taking precautions so it can keep operating if Washington does blacklist it.""We are establishing non-affiliated business units. Or deal with large local partners,"" said the source, who declined to be identified to avoid attracting attention to his boss's business.A Russian finance ministry source said he expected an uptick in the number of shell companies being set up as a mechanism to bypass the expanded sanctions.Two executives from two top-20 Russian banks said they viewed the fact their clients included Rosneft as a risk. One said many of the bank's clients had started to ask whether the Rosneft ties exposed the lender to sanctions risk."

317,2018-01-12T20:28:50-0500," AWS finished the fourth quarter with 62 percent market share, down from 68 percent a year earlier, KeyBanc analysts said. Microsoft's Azure growth is one reason that KeyBanc analysts raised their price target for the company heading into 2018. Amazon lost share in the public cloud business in the fourth quarter, while Microsoft continued to gain momentum, according to research from KeyBanc analysts.Amazon Web Services had 62 percent market share in the quarter, down from 68 percent a year earlier, KeyBanc's Brent Bracelin and other analysts wrote in a note on Thursday. Microsoft Azure jumped from 16 percent to 20 percent, and Google's share increased from 10 percent to 12 percent, they said.According to KeyBanc, Azure likely contributed $3.7 billion to Microsoft's fiscal 2017 revenue, which totaled an estimated $96.6 billion. That suggests Azure almost doubled, which is consistent with Microsoft's disclosures about Azure's revenue growth in recent quarters. Amazon, meanwhile, said that AWS grew 42 percent in the third quarter. The analysts expect Azure's revenue growth to slow in fiscal year 2018 to 88 percent.The KeyBanc report compared the big three cloud providers' artificial intelligence tools and found that Microsoft ""has more pre-built models than other public cloud vendors"" and makes them available from more data centers around the world.Citing Azure growth as well as Microsoft's opportunities in AI, the analysts raised Microsoft's 12-month price target from $94 to $106. The stock closed at $89.60 on Friday.""After our conversations with leaders at Microsoft, we came away believing the majority of revenue will come from the surrounding infrastructure costs, rather than the monetization of specific AI services, due to the required intensive model training and ongoing inference,"" Bracelin and the other analysts wrote."
318,2018-01-09T12:01:29-0500," Microsoft said most Windows 7 and Windows 8 users relying on older chips will notice the performance impact of updates to protect against Meltdown and Spectre. The company also said Windows Server performance will be degraded if customers choose to install updates that are meant to protect against untrusted code.  Microsoft on Tuesday provided new details on the performance impact of updates to protect against recently disclosed security vulnerabilities. In certain cases, performance on Windows will be significantly slowed by patches for the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities.Some people have found that their servers and PCs are performing differently after installing updates, so the news shouldn't come as a big surprise. Still, the new information doesn't line up perfectly well with what Intel said last week when the vulnerabilities were first officially announced. ""Any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant,"" the chipmaker said.Microsoft expects most people using Windows 7 and Windows 8 on chips that are from 2015 or older will notice performance degradations, Terry Myerson, executive vice president for Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group, wrote in a blog post. The company did not publish specific performance benchmarks to back up the claims.Some people using Windows 10 with Intel Haswell chips or anything older will notice performance impacts, Myerson wrote. But those people running Windows 10 on Skylake, Kaby Lake or newer Intel chips probably won't notice performance issues, although internally run benchmarks show single-digit slowdowns, Myerson wrote.The case is different for Windows Server, Microsoft's operating system for servers. Should customers choose to install updates to protect against issues stemming from untrusted code running on those machines, there will be a more significant performance impact, Myerson wrote. ""This is why you want to be careful to evaluate the risk of untrusted code for each Windows Server instance, and balance the security versus performance tradeoff for your environment,"" he wrote.At this point, Microsoft has provided Meltdown and Spectre patches for 41 of the 45 versions of Windows through Windows Update, Myerson wrote.Intel stock went down after Microsoft released the news. It traded as low as $43.75, about 2 percent lower than opening price, falling from about $44.34 per share immediately after the announcement. Microsoft stock initially faltered but then reversed its decline.Later on Tuesday Intel offered new details on PC performance impacts because of security updates.""Based on our most recent PC benchmarking, we continue to expect that the performance impact should not be significant for average computer users. This means the typical home and business PC user should not see significant slowdowns in common tasks such as reading email, writing a document or accessing digital photos,"" Intel said in a statement. The testing on PCs with the latest Intel silicon found an impact of 6 percent or less, the company said.Intel said it's still trying to get a sense of performance changes for chips used in data centers."

Diversity is a major issue in tech industry, says Smith, also chief legal officer. Microsoft is taking ""concrete steps"" to address diversity issues, he argues. Microsoft's president said on Tuesday there would probably be fewer reports on sexual harassment if there were more women in leadership.""I just don't believe that any institution that has a strong representation of women at the leadership level is likely to face some of the problems we've been reading about,"" said Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer at the software giant.""We need to do a lot more to address diversity issues in the tech sector,"" he added on CNBC's ""Squawk Alley."" ""There is no substitute for getting more women in more positions of leadership.""Smith, also a board member at Netflix, said Microsoft and the general tech industry needs to take ""concrete steps"" in 2018 to address diversity issues, such as using the buzz from the #metoo and #timesup discussion as a starting point, ""so that women's voices can always be heard if they're facing a sexual harassment problem.""Last month, Microsoft endorsed the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Harassment Act, a bipartisan bill from Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, that would ensure that anyone who faced sexual harassment in the workplace could make their case in a public court.""As each new story about sexual harassment demonstrates, current approaches in this area have proven insufficient,"" Smith wrote on the Microsoft blog in December. ""Even as we look squarely at the sins of the past, we must take stronger steps to prevent these problems in the future.""The computer software company does not enforce an arbitration provision relating to sexual harassment, according to Smith. But, he noted, Microsoft has contractual clauses requiring pre-dispute arbitration for a small number of employees.The tech industry is ripe with diversity and gender issues. Most recently, for the second year in a row, no female leaders were among the keynote speakers at the Consumer Electronics Show, the tech industry's largest annual trade show in Las Vegas that's underway this week. The lack of female voices at the convention caused a backlash on social media with the hashtag #CESSoMale.Microsoft also came under fire in October 2014 when its then-new CEO Satya Nadella advocated for women to not ask for pay raises. Nadella was speaking at a conference for women in computing, one of the largest gatherings of women in the world, when he told the audience to have ""faith in the system.""""That I think might be one of the additional super powers that, quite frankly, women who don't ask for a raise have,"" Nadella said at the time. ""Because that's good karma."" He later apologized and said the response was a misunderstanding.Microsoft is now taking steps to change the hiring process and the way senior executives are paid in order to reflect diversity progress, Smith told CNBC Tuesday.""Satya has been driving a different culture here at Microsoft that bodes well for this,"" Smith said of his boss. ""It's all about trying to empathize and understand each other and learn together."""

322,2018-01-08T10:24:23-0500," Microsoft is not a consumer-focused company, and never will be despite many attempts over the decades. Microsoft had a beachhead of tens of millions of voice-enabled devices in place before Amazon even hinted at the Echo. Microsoft is good at creating platforms that others build on. This post originally appeared on Hal Berenson's blog on Jan. 6 and is republished here with permission.When it comes to the consumer, Microsoft's history can best be described as, ""I got it. I got it. I got it. &lt;THUMP&gt; I ain't got it."" Jan. 6 was the fourth anniversary of my Xbox: Fail blog post, and last week Microsoft put the  final nail in the coffin of Kinect. So it really is an appropriate point to talk about Microsoft and the consumer. Microsoft is not a consumer-focused company, and never will be despite many attempts over the decades. Recognition of this reality, and an end to tilting at windmills, is one of the things that Satya Nadella seems to have brought to the table.First let's get something out of the way, we need to refine what we mean by the label ""consumer."" It isn't simply the opposite of business or organizational users. Microsoft has always done just fine in providing individuals with personal productivity and content creation tools. The Windows-based PC remains at the center of any complex activity. Sure I book some flights on my iPhone or iPad. But when I start putting together a complex multi-leg trip the PC becomes my main tool. Office has done well with consumers, and continues to do so in spite of popular free tools from Google. And over the last few years Microsoft has gained traction with the artistic design crowd that had always gravitated towards the Mac. So when we talk about the consumer we really are talking experiences that are left of center on the content consumption to content creation spectrum. Microsoft will always be a strong player on the right of center content creation scale, be it for individuals, families or organizations. But other than console gaming, they aren't going to be a significant player on the left of center experiences. And Microsoft fans are going to go crazy over that.The end of life for Kinect is the perfect illustration of Microsoft's inability to be a consumer player. The Xbox One with (then mandatory) Kinect was introduced a year before the Amazon Fire TV and a year and half before the Amazon Echo. It was originally tasked with becoming the center of home entertainment and offered a voice interface. Go read my Xbox: Fail piece for how it wasn't ready to live up to that design center. It's pretty typical Microsoft V1 stuff. Unfortunately the Xbox One was also V1 from a console gaming perspective, so Microsoft focused on making it more competitive in that niche and abandoned pushing forward on the home entertainment side. Imagine that: Microsoft had a beachhead of tens of millions of voice-enabled devices in place before Amazon even hinted at the Echo, and failed to capitalize on it. You can repeat that story many times over the last 25 years.It isn't that Xbox One was the perfect device for the coming voice assistant, or streaming TV, revolutions. The need to be a great gaming console gave it much too high a price point for non-gamers. But Microsoft could have continued to evolve both the experience and produced lower priced, non-gaming focused hardware. Contrast what Microsoft did with what Amazon did around the Echo. When the Echo was introduced it was considered a curiosity, a niche voice-operated speaker for playing music. When Amazon started to gain traction with the Echo and Alexa, they went all in, and as a result have a strong lead in today's hottest segment of the consumer technology space. It reminded me a lot of Microsoft's pivot to the Internet back in 1995. But in the Xbox One case, Microsoft had the vision (at least in general direction), but failed to capitalize on it. Failed to even make a serious attempt. Now, at best, it could fight it out for a distant fourth or fifth place in voice assistants and home entertainment. This consumer stuff just isn't in Microsoft's DNA.The death of the Groove Music Service is another example, and maybe more telling on why Microsoft hasn't been able to crack the code on the consumer. Groove is just the latest name for Zune's music service. When MP3 players became popular Microsoft jumped on the bandwagon based on its DNA, it relied on third parties that it supplied with technology (e.g., DRM). When that didn't even turn out to be a speed bump on the iPod's adoption, it finally introduced the Zune as a first party device. To have as good an experience as an iPod, the Zune needed an iTunes equivalent and what we now know as the Groove Music Service was born. Despite the jokes that failure often leads to, the Zune was a quite nice device. But since it couldn't play the music you'd acquired with iTunes there really was no iPod to Zune migration path. By the time Zune came on the market the game was already over. As Zune died other consumer-focused device efforts came to the fore (Kin, Windows Phone 7, Xbox One) and the music service lived on. But since the devices never gained traction neither did the music service. And for Microsoft the music service was never a player on its own, it was just a necessary evil to support its consumer device experience. And with that mindset, the failure to gain traction with consumer devices meant Groove was superfluous. Sure Groove could have owned the segments that Spotify and Pandora now dominate, but that was never what Microsoft was going for. And now, it is too late.Being a content creator or distributor is not in Microsoft's DNA. It has an immune system that rejects it time and time again. Microsoft made a big play on consumer titles in the early to mid '90s, remember Microsoft Dogs and Encarta? Offerings like these are very manpower intensive because they need a lot of content production, editing, frequent updating, sell for very little, are expensive to localize, and often don't even make sense globally. So Microsoft concluded they didn't fit well with its business model and backed away from all but a few major titles such as Encarta. While Encarta was great for its time, the Internet left it competing with Wikipedia. That destroyed what little economic value Encarta had. Other content-oriented efforts, such as Slate, were disposed of to save costs when the Internet Bubble burst. The MSNBC joint venture was allowed to dissolve when its contract came up for renewal. And so on.I could even say that great end user experiences are not in Microsoft's DNA, though that one is more debatable. Usually it is thought of as being consistently second to Apple. So rather than saying they aren't in Microsoft's DNA, I'd say that Microsoft user experiences are almost always compromised by more dominant aspects of its DNA. And that keeps it from being a great consumer experience company.What is Microsoft good at? Creating platforms that others build on. Doing work that is technically hard, and takes a lot of engineering effort, that it can sell over and over again. High fixed cost, very low variable cost, very high volume, globally scalable has been its business model all along. Consumer businesses usually have moderate to high variable costs, so there is problem number one. Only the top two players in a segment usually can achieve very high volume, so unless Microsoft achieves leadership early in a segment it never can get high enough volume to have a successful business model. A head-on charge against the established leaders rarely works, and when it does it is a financial bloodbath. So you may not need to be the first in market, but you need to be in early enough for the main land grab —  or wait for the next paradigm shift to try again. And global scaling of consumer offerings is way more difficult than for platforms or business-focused offerings.Microsoft seems to have resolved to focus on its DNA. It will be supportive, even encouraging, of third parties who want to use its platforms to offer consumer services but avoid going after the consumer directly. So you get a Cortana-enabled smart speaker from Harmon-Kardon, a high-end Cortana-enabled thermostat from Johnson Controls, a set of smart fixtures from Kohler that use Amazon's Alexa for voice control but Microsoft Azure for the rest of their back-end, and an agreement with Amazon for Cortana-Alexa integration.Will Microsoft introduce consumer devices or services in the future? Possibly, but they will suffer the same fate as its earlier attempts. And I'm not throwing good money after bad (and I did throw a lot at every consumer thing Microsoft ever did). I recognize that these attempts are at best trial balloons, and at worst ill-advised ventures by those intoxicated at the potential size of market. Microsoft is an arms supplier. It should supply arms to companies going after the consumer, but avoid future attempts to fight consumer product wars itself.Hal Berenson is President of True Mountain Group, LLC which provides technology and management consulting.

325,2018-01-03T17:58:48-0500," Microsoft is taking an unusual approach to updating Windows and its cloud services in light of the issues affecting several kinds of processors. Google published new details about the vulnerabilities. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google said they are working on updates to cloud services and other products to prevent exploitation of chip-level security vulnerabilities.The vulnerabilities, which were publicly disclosed by the Register on Tuesday, could allow a hacker to steal information stored in the memory of a wide range of computer chips running on personal devices, like computers, as well as servers in data centers, including those used to run cloud computing services. It could allow a hacker to steal information stored in the memory of the chip itself, including things such as passwords and cached files. It could also pave the way for attackers to weaken other security features.One of the vulnerabilities, dubbed Meltdown, is known to affect Intel chips. Another, Spectre, could affect chips from many vendors. Indeed, Arm said that some processors based on its technology are affected.""We're aware of this industry-wide issue and have been working closely with chip manufacturers to develop and test mitigations to protect our customers,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email. ""We are in the process of deploying mitigations to cloud services and have also released security updates to protect Windows customers against vulnerabilities affecting supported hardware chips from Intel, Arm, and AMD.""In addition to patching its cloud services and current and older versions of Windows for servers and desktops, Microsoft has updated its Edge and Internet Explorer browsers. Updates for Microsoft Surface devices are coming as well.Google was the company to first alert Intel to the vulnerability, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said on CNBC earlier on Wednesday.Subsequently Google released some details about the issues but said a full report is still to come. A new site discussing the Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities credits Google's Jann Horn and third-party researchers with discovering them.Google said it has updated its public cloud service to prevent attacks related to Meltdown and Spectre. ""We used our VM Live Migration technology to perform the updates with no user impact, no forced maintenance windows and no required restarts,"" Google engineering vice president Ben Treynor Sloss wrote in a blog post. But customers will still need to update the operating systems they use on the Google cloud.Google has also been busy checking on consumer services. Exploitation is ""difficult and limited"" for most Android devices, and the latest version of Chrome OS is patched, Google said.Amazon told customers of its Amazon Web Services cloud service that the vulnerability ""has existed for more than 20 years in modern processor architectures like Intel, AMD, and ARM across servers, desktops, and mobile devices."" It said that it's already protected nearly all AWS instances, although customers will still have to patch the operating systems they use. In the CNBC interview Krzanich said he was not aware of exploits of the issue, and Microsoft has not gotten any indication that the vulnerabilities ""had been used to attack our customers,"" the spokesperson said.Aside from security concerns, the Register and some individuals suggested that patches to operating systems could result in performance slowdowns. But in a statement on Wednesday, Intel said that ""any performance impacts are workload-dependent, and, for the average computer user, should not be significant and will be mitigated over time.""Microsoft told customers of its Azure public cloud in a blog post that they ""should not see a noticeable performance impact.""VMware has come out with patches for its desktop and server virtualization software.Linux distribution vendor Red Hat is working on making product updates available to customers. ""Red Hat is taking a proactive position that favors security over performance, while allowing users the flexibility to assess their own environment and make appropriate tradeoffs through selectively enabling and disabling the various mitigations,"" the company said on a website devoted to the vulnerabilities.Some Red Hat patches are live, and more will be coming in the next few days, a spokesperson told CNBC in an email.

326,2018-12-13T16:04:00-0500,"(Adds Branson comments on business strategy)MOJAVE, Calif., Dec 13 (Reuters) - A Virgin Galactic rocket plane reached space on Thursday and returned safely to the California desert, capping years of testing to become the first U.S. commercial human flight to breach Earth's atmosphere since America's shuttle program ended in 2011.The successful test flight presages a new era of civilian space travel that could kick off as soon as next year, with Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic battling billionaire-backed ventures such as Amazon.com Inc founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, to be the first to offer suborbital flights to fare-paying tourists.Branson, who said he personally put up $1 billion toward the roughly $1.3 billion development costs for Virgin's space businesses, told Reuters he viewed competition with Bezos and others as a race, though passenger safety was the top priority.""Today we get to enjoy the fact that we have put people into space before anybody else,"" Branson said.Virgin's twin-fuselage carrier airplane holding the SpaceShipTwo passenger spacecraft took off at 7:11 a.m. local time (1511 GMT) from the Mojave Air and Space Port, about 90 miles (145 km) north of Los Angeles.British billionaire Branson, wearing jeans and a leather bomber jacket with a fur collar, attended the take-off along with hundreds of spectators on a crisp morning in the California desert.After the rocket plane, also called the VSS Unity, reached an apogee of 51.4 miles (83 km) above Earth, a crying Branson hugged his son and high-fived and hugged other spectators. The plane reentered the atmosphere at 2.5 times the speed of sound and landed a few minutes later to cheers and applause, concluding roughly an hour's journey.One of the pilots handed Branson a small Earth stress ball when the two hugged.Thursday's test flight - the fourth mission during which VSS Unity flew under its own power - had pilots Mark Stucky and Frederick Sturckow onboard, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.The next flight test is within the next couple of months, depending on data analysis from Thursday's flight, Virgin Galactic said. Branson has said Virgin's first commercial space trip with him onboard would happen ""in months and not years.""51.4 MILES ABOVE EARTHThe carrier airplane hauled the SpaceShipTwo passenger rocket plane to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) and released it. Seconds later, SpaceShipTwo fired, catapulting it to more than 51 miles above Earth, high enough for the pilots to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.The ship's rocket igniting and vertical ascent through a cloudless sky could be seen from the ground.Virgin's latest flight test comes four years after the original SpaceShipTwo crashed during a test flight that killed the co-pilot and seriously injured the pilot, dealing a major setback to Virgin Galactic, a U.S. offshoot of the London-based Virgin Group.""It's been 14 long years to get here,"" Branson told reporters after the landmark flight. ""We've had tears, real tears, and we've had moments of joy. So the tears today were tears of joy.""EXPENSIVE TRIPNearly 700 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin's suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000. Virgin Galactic has received about $80 million in deposits from future astronauts, Branson said.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Branson added that he ""would be delighted to offer Bezos a flight on Virgin"" and for Bezos ""to maybe offer me a flight"" on New Shepard.Bezos' New Shepard has already flown to the internationally recognized boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line at 62 miles (100 km) - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin's Thursday launch did not go as high as the Karman line. Its pilots were aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky, which is the U.S. military and NASA's definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk's SpaceX and late Microsoft Corp co-founder Paul Allen's Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company's first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla Inc , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.Looking to the future after the successful flight, Branson talked about the possibility of using his space plane to link international cities, offering orbital space flights, or potentially even building a Virgin hotel in space.""One thing leads onto another. I forever dream,"" he told Reuters. ""Actually, I said to my son today, we were sitting in the cockpit (before the flight), and I said sometimes I think life is just one incredible dream.""(Reporting by Eric M.

331,2017-12-26T12:57:45-0500," Hortonworks, which once counted on Microsoft for over half its revenue, has drastically reduced its dependence. Gaming companies Electronic Arts and Take-Two each get more than 10 percent of sales from Microsoft.  Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, recently said the company has always been led by partners. In late 2014, when software developer Hortonworks was getting ready to go public, the company was not in the healthiest position. Almost one-quarter of its revenue came from a single company: Microsoft.While that was an improvement from the prior year, when a staggering 55 percent of sales came from Microsoft, it was still a bright red flag for investors, who were concerned about whether Hortonworks was diversified enough to flourish as an independent company.From its $16 IPO price in December 2014, the stock lost more than half its value over the next 22 months to a low of $6.42 in October 2016.Hortonworks had a good reason for its Microsoft collaboration, which started in 2011, the same year the fledgling company spun out of Yahoo. As a start-up with a package of open source software for running big data projects, Hortonworks' early integrations with Microsoft's Windows Server operating system and Azure public cloud allowed the company to pick up new business that it couldn't have attracted on its own.""It put us on the map,"" said Mike Volpi, a Hortonworks board member and a partner at Index Ventures, which backed Hortonworks in 2011. ""It gave us access to a lot of important customers. It was definitely material.""Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who was involved in the Hortonworks deal when he was running the cloud division, said at an event in July that ""Microsoft has always been a partner-led company.""Today, five companies derive at least 10 percent of their revenue from Microsoft, according to FactSet, but Hortonworks isn't one of them. As of 2016, its reliance on Microsoft was down to 6 percent. Hortonworks now has more than 1,000 customers with active support subscriptions, up from 332 at the end of 2014.Investors who stuck around have been rewarded. The stock has more than tripled from its low point and was trading at $20.54 as of midday Tuesday.Diversifying beyond Microsoft has only been a part of the turnaround. Volpi said that Wall Street, which had been critical of high sales and marketing costs at Hortonworks, has now seen that spending pay off in terms of continued growth. In the latest quarter, Hortonworks generated 45 percent revenue growth from a year earlier, while its operating expenses fell slightly. The Hortonworks story resonates across technology and beyond. The five most valuable companies in the world are all U.S. tech companies, and an increasing number of businesses are reliant on those platforms for distribution and revenue.It's a double-edged sword. As quickly and efficiently as Microsoft, Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook can help smaller players get traction, they can just as readily take it away by launching a competitive product, changing pricing or altering their strategy. Abhey Lamba, an analyst at Mizuho who has followed Hortonworks for years, said the issue of Microsoft concentration was a real one in the company's early days.  ""It was concerning because at that time you're reliant on Microsoft quite deeply,"" said Lamba, who now has a hold rating on Hortonworks.Accounting standards require that public companies in the U.S. disclose any customer that accounts for 10 percent or more of revenue. Two companies that currently count Microsoft as a 10 percent customer -- Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive Software -- make games for Microsoft's Xbox game console. For them, Microsoft is both a distributor and a competitor, because the software giant acquired the developer behind ""Minecraft"" and makes its own games like ""Forza Motorsport 6"" and ""Halo 5: Guardians.""Gaming revenue, which includes console and subscription sales, came out to less than 8 percent of Microsoft's total revenue for the quarter that ended in September.Two hardware makers have an outsized dependence on Microsoft.Chipmaker AMD received more than 10 percent of its revenue from Microsoft in 2016 by selling processors embedded in Xbox consoles and Azure servers. And then there's Applied Optoelectronics, an obscure Texas company specializing in fiber-optic networking equipment for cable TV and data centers.Applied has seen its Microsoft business swell from 3.6 percent in 2014 to 12 percent in 2015 and 18 percent in 2016. Its technology is used to ensure that data can move quickly around data centers, which explains why Microsoft and Amazon together accounted for 73 percent of Applied's revenue last year. Amazon, through its cloud-computing division, and Microsoft are the two top cloud infrastructure providers, and both are investing heavily in equipment to handle the surge of data moving to the public cloud. Microsoft's capital expenses topped $10 billion in the latest fiscal year.Applied is picking up substantial business as a low-cost player in a market that includes the likes of Finisar, Lumentum and Oclaro. The stock has surged 65 percent this year.But things got rocky in October. The company issued a statement with preliminary results for the third quarter and investors hit the exits, sending the shares down 12 percent. The stock is more than 50 percent off its high from August.On the earnings call, the company said there had been a ""slowdown in demand from a large customer."" Analysts assumed it was a reference to Amazon.""We are disappointed with our third quarter performance,"" CFO Stefan Murry said. ""Revenue from this customer in the quarter was approximately 10 percent of total revenue compared with 47 percent last quarter.""After the report, analysts at D.A. Davidson cited Applied's customer base as a potential risk to the company.""Applied Optoelectronics depends on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenues,"" wrote the analysts, who nevertheless kept their buy rating on the stock. ""The loss of a major customer could have a materially adverse effect on its financial performance and condition."" Applied did not respond to requests for comment. But Murry did emphasize during the earnings call that the company has made progress in diversification.""We're no longer as tied to a particular customer in terms of living and dying by that visibility,"" he said."

334,2017-12-19T09:02:19-0500," Forced arbitration lets companies keep harassment and discrimination claims out of court, effectively cloaking them from public view and, in some cases, allowing serial harassers to continue their conduct for years. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of senators, including Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, proposed legislation that would make forced arbitration in harassment cases unenforceable under federal law. The wave of sexual harassment claims has toppled powerful men in entertainment, media and politics. Now, it is also creating permanent changes in workplace policy at one giant technology company.Microsoft, one of the world’s biggest software makers, said on Tuesday that it had eliminated forced arbitration agreements with employees who make sexual harassment claims and was also supporting a proposed federal law that would widely ban such agreements.The moves make Microsoft an early company — and certainly the most prominent — to take such steps to end legal agreements that have been criticized for helping to perpetuate sexual abuse in the workplace. Forced arbitration lets companies keep harassment and discrimination claims out of court, effectively cloaking them from public view and, in some cases, allowing serial harassers to continue their conduct for years.“The silencing of people’s voices has clearly had an impact in perpetuating sexual harassment,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer, said in a phone interview.Microsoft’s action shows how the flood of harassment accusations has gone beyond individual cases to an examination of policy changes for ending the misconduct. That includes greater scrutiny of legal settlements that have silenced victims of abuse.In one prominent case, an arbitration clause nearly prevented Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News anchor, from bringing her lawsuit over sexual harassment against Roger Ailes, the former chairman and chief executive of Fox News. Ms. Carlson found a legal maneuver allowing her into court, but many employees are not as lucky.In an op-ed article in The New York Times in October, Ms. Carlson wrote that “reforming arbitration laws is key to stopping sexual harassment.” According to the Economic Policy Institute, more than half of American workers are bound by arbitration clauses.Since then, lawmakers have taken up the issue. Earlier this month, a bipartisan group of senators, including Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democrat Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, proposed legislation that would make forced arbitration in harassment cases unenforceable under federal law.Mr. Smith of Microsoft said he first became aware of the Senate bill after meeting with Mr. Graham in Washington to discuss cybersecurity and immigration. Mr. Graham urged Microsoft to support the bill, Mr. Smith said.“What this legislation does is ensure that peoples’ voices can always be heard by going to court, if that’s what it takes for those voices to be heard,” Mr. Smith said. “It’s the kind of step that can make a difference.”He said eliminating the arbitration requirement for harassment claims by its own employees represented an immediate step the company could take while the Senate bill was being considered. The move is largely symbolic because only a minority of Microsoft workers — numbering in the hundreds in its senior ranks, according to Mr. Smith — have been subject to the requirement. Microsoft will still require those employees to take claims unrelated to harassment and gender discrimination to arbitration. In total, Microsoft has about 125,000 employees around the world.Like other technology companies, Microsoft has faced accusations that it has tolerated harassment and discrimination against female employees. Last week, Bloomberg reported that documents unsealed in a gender bias case showed that an unnamed former intern for Microsoft accused another intern of sexually assaulting her outside of work, and that Microsoft required the two of them to continue working together while it investigated the claims.In a statement, Microsoft said it did not tolerate sexual harassment or assault. “We work hard to create a safe work environment for every employee,” the company said, adding that it encouraged the former intern to take her complaint to law enforcement.Ms. Gillibrand said that getting rid of the arbitration agreements would benefit employers in the long run. “Without the secrecy of mandatory arbitration agreements, serial predators will be less likely to continue climbing the corporate ladder and employees won’t be forced to stay quiet about the harassment they have faced at work, which is good for employees and good for business,” she said in a statement.By using the arbitration clauses to bar people from joining together as a group, employers — both large and small — have effectively taken away one of the few tools that workers have to fight harassment or discrimination.More from The New York Times:A Bitcoin Hedge Fund's Return: 25,004 Percent (That Wasn't a Typo)Inside the Home of Instant Pot, the Kitchen Gadget That Spawned a ReligionFor Russian 'Trolls,' Instagram's Pictures Can Spread Wider Than WordsThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has found that forced arbitration “can prevent employees from learning about similar concerns shared by others in their workplace.” Given the proliferation of the clauses, some regulators and civil rights experts also worry that arbitration clauses can obscure patterns of wrongdoing.Strict confidentiality can turn up in a variety of contexts, from payday-lending outfits, which sometimes rely on them to conceal the true identity of lenders that operate through shell companies, to personal relationships. Employment contracts are among the most problematic, lawyers said.In arbitration, the rules tilt heavily in favor of businesses, employment experts said. Part of the problem is that instead of judges, cases are decided by arbitrators who sometimes consider the companies that routinely bring them business their clients, according to interviews with arbitrators.The more often companies head to arbitration, the better their chances of winning the case, according to the conclusion of a 2011 analysis by Alexander J. S. Colvin, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations.Of 3,945 employment cases decided by arbitrators from one of the nation’s biggest arbitration firms, plaintiffs prevailed in about 31 percent of them when employers had only one case before the arbitrator, according to Mr. Colvin’s study. The rate of victory plummeted by more than half when companies had multiple cases before the same arbitrator."

The data was tepid enough to lower bets for faster future interest rate hikes without fanning fears of an economic slowdown.Stock futures pared losses after the report and the three major indexes moved higher shortly after the open.

Nadella cited Jeff Bezos when asked who he most looks up to other than Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on Wednesday said he wished that the company had gotten into the public cloud business earlier.Nadella, who ran Microsoft's cloud and enterprise business before becoming its CEO in 2014, made the admission to Marty Chavez, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Goldman Sachs, during a conversation streamed live from the bank's Facebook page.Microsoft launched its first Azure service in 2008, two years after Amazon introduced its core cloud computing and storage resources. Today, Amazon Web Services holds nearly 32 percent of the public cloud infrastructure services market, while Microsoft has about 14 percent, according to Canalys.Over the years, Microsoft had built up a major server software business — which it stored on companies' premises, Nadella said. Then came AWS — which forced Microsoft to rethink its whole business model.""We knew by looking at what Amazon was doing that we needed to reinvent ourselves, and by the way, the margins were going to be very, very different -- tough challenge,"" Nadella said, in response to a question from Chavez about disruption and internal innovation.Nadella said Microsoft cofounder and former CEO Bill Gates had even encouraged him to rethink the server business.It's important for a business to be able to recognize and move in response to the emergence of a new business model, Nadella said.""In our case, we did,"" he said. ""I mean, I wish we had started even earlier ... like always. ...

Apple traded up 2.1 percent, giving it a market capitalization of $864.8 billion.Microsoft, which on Friday closed above Apple's market capitalization for the first time in eight years, was up 0.9 percent, leaving its stock market value at $859.0 billion, third in the group.The tight race between the trio of high-powered technology stocks coincided with a broad stock market rally after the United States and China agreed on a temporary truce in their ongoing trade dispute.Apple in August became the first U.S. publicly-listed company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, but its share price has fallen sharply in recent months as investors worried that demand for iPhones was losing steam.Its market capitalization overtook Microsoft's in 2010 as Microsoft struggled with slow demand for personal computers, due in part to the explosion of smartphones like the iPhone.Amazon.com's stock has recovered most of the ground it lost after the online retailer in October forecast disappointing sales for the holiday quarter.Although it is down about 13 percent from its Sept. 4 record-high close, in the year to date Amazon's stock is up 51 percent, compared to a 31 percent rise for Microsoft and Apple's 8 percent increase.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; editing by Rosalba O'Brien and G Crosse)"
340,2017-12-08T12:13:22-0500," The Evercore analysts said the introduction of Microsoft 365 will expand the total addressable market that was previously targeted by Microsoft's Office 365 E3 commercial offering. The Azure public cloud could post an operating margin in excess of 30 percent, beyond that of Amazon's cloud, in the coming years, the analysts said. Microsoft could reach a $1 trillion market cap by 2020 or sooner, analysts from Evercore ISI said in a Thursday note. The company's current market cap is around $650 billion.In coming up with their calculations, the analysts — who also raised their target price from $93 to $106 — pointed to the growth of Microsoft's Office business, partly thanks to pushes into the world of front-line workers and the education market.The analysts also cited the new Microsoft 365 offering, which bundles several services along with Office 365 applications, as a key growth driver, as it could convince businesses to subscribe to services they normally would skip.The analysts expect Microsoft's Office 365 commercial business to generate $26.86 billion in revenue in the company's 2021 fiscal year, which will go through the second half of 2020 and continue through the middle of 2021.""While we believe best in breed offerings such as Okta for IAM, Tableau/Qlik for BI/Analytics, Box/Dropbox for collaboration, or VMware AirWatch for EMM will maintain their respective leadership positions, on the margin, we expect Microsoft 365 to win incremental share over time due to its ease of integration with the broader Office productivity platform and enterprise customers' proclivity to buy a 'suite' of products vs. best of breed solutions, especially in the SMB market where IT resources are scarce,"" Evercore analysts Kirk Materne, Fenn Hoffman,  Tom Mao and Daniel Greenfield wrote.The analysts predicted that the Office 365 consumer business will produce $5.18 billion in revenue in Microsoft's 2021 fiscal year. At the same time, Microsoft's Azure public cloud business — which is second only to Amazon Web Services — continues to grow, and the Evercore analysts said that in the company's 2021 fiscal year it could register $22.19 billion in revenue. The analysts pointed to the Azure Stack private cloud software, which is meant to mirror what's available on the Azure cloud, as a point of differentiation. ""As Azure's revenue scales across a more fixed base of infrastructure investments, we believe Azure has the potential to drive meaningful operating leverage and FCF over the next 4 years and should ultimately reach 30%+ op. margins (vs. AWS at 25% today), to become one of Microsoft's core earnings and FCF drivers over the next decade,"" the analysts wrote.They noted that declines in devices and on-premises versions of the Dynamics and Office software should be partly offset by growth from LinkedIn and gaming."
341,2017-12-08T15:36:26-0500," Microsoft, Google have spoken with Qualcomm about Broadcom takeover concerns. Both companies worried Broadcom may interfere with Qualcomm 5G investment. Apple could be main beneficiary of Broadcom acquisition. Microsoft and Google are among companies that have expressed private concerns to Qualcomm about a Broadcom takeover, according to people familiar with the matter.The companies are wary of Apple's potential influence over a deal, said the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions are private. They're also worried about Broadcom's reputation of cutting costs rather than investing in new technology, the people said.Qualcomm rejected a hostile $105 billion bid last month, leading to Broadcom nominating a new slate of board directors for the San Diego-based company earlier this week. Regulators frequently ask for industry input when making a judgment on whether or not to approve a deal. Qualcomm has said it has antitrust concerns about a potential Broadcom takeover.Qualcomm has told Microsoft, Google and other companies not to make any public statements  opposing a deal, said the sources. Qualcomm wants to find out if Broadcom will significantly increase its $70-per-share offer before taking a firmer stance against a possible deal, said the people. A Broadcom transaction for Qualcomm may improve Apple's relationship with the chipmaker, which currently provides chips used in the iPhone and iPad.  Qualcomm is suing Apple for patent infringement after Apple in January sued Qualcomm for roughly $1 billion, claiming Qualcomm charged royalties improperly. Qualcomm has issued and applied more than 130,000 patents covering, among other things, smartphone technology.The litigation could result in Apple abandoning Qualcomm for future products. But Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan has privately expressed optimism about settling an ongoing litigation with Apple if Broadcom were to acquire Qualcomm, according to a person familiar with the matter.Apple's gain could be its competition's loss. In Google's case, many of the phone and tablet makers who build phones on its market-leading Android operating system use Qualcomm processors. Android and its derivatives make up 85 percent of the smartphone market, according to IDC.Microsoft just announced the first Windows 10 PCs using Qualcomm chips, and it may continue to push these types of tablet and hybrid PCs, which use less power than traditional Intel-based PCs, as it seeks to compete with Apple's iPad. While Microsoft and Google are two of the largest companies in the world, neither rival Apple or Samsung in terms of sales volume from either Qualcomm or Broadcom. Still, both Microsoft and Google perceive an independent Qualcomm as being more closely aligned with their interests than a Broadcom-owned Qualcomm that is tighter with Apple.The companies have also privately expressed concerns with Tan's reputation of cutting costs at the expense of increasing spending on innovation, two of the people said.Complaints from these third parties could play a role in scuppering the deal. In the press release announcing the proposed buyout, Tan said ""We would not make this offer if we were not confident that our common global customers would embrace the proposed combination.""Spokespeople for Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Google declined to comment. A spokesperson for Microsoft couldn't be reached for comment."

344,2017-12-05T17:26:30-0500," Microsoft's Amy Hood sees Google's cloud in competitive situations more frequently than it has in past years. Hood also said Alibaba's cloud is currently ""aggressive"" in Africa and Asia. Microsoft finance chief Amy Hood was complimentary of Google's cloud computing unit on Tuesday, and had particularly flattering words for CEO Diane Greene.Speaking at the 2017 Wells Fargo Tech Summit in Utah, Hood said that Microsoft has been seeing Google's rival cloud more frequently in a competitive setting.Microsoft's Azure cloud service and Office 365 cloud-based productivity apps are in a high-stakes battle with the Google Cloud Platform and G Suite. In the public cloud business, both Microsoft and Google trail market leader Amazon Web Services.In her Tuesday remarks -- which came after Wells Fargo analyst Philip Winslow specifically asked about Google -- Hood also praised Greene, the head of Google's cloud efforts for the past two years. Greene, who was formerly CEO of VMware, announced last week that she hired Diane Bryant from Intel to be operating chief of Google's cloud.""We've seen more of them in the past few quarters than we've seen before,"" Hood said. ""I think they're making a good effort. I think Diane Greene is an excellent leader and an established enterprise CEO.""Hood went on to say that Greene has ""always been a winner.""Hood's amicable tone represented quite the contrast to the war of words of late between AWS and Oracle when it comes to the cloud. Oracle CEO Mark Hurd went after Amazon in October, claiming a workload on AWS could be six times more expensive than on Oracle's cloud. AWS CEO Andy Jassy responded last week saying, ""I think they're a long way away in the cloud.""In the third quarter, Amazon had 31.8 percent share of the cloud infrastructure services market, Microsoft had 13.9 percent and Google had 6 percent, according to Canalys.Hood talked more broadly about cloud competition in certain parts of the world and she acknowledged the growth of the Alibaba public cloud. Alibaba isn't among the leaders in the U.S., but elsewhere in the world, particularly in Asia and Africa, it's a different story.The company is ""well-funded, well capitalized, certainly aggressive."" Hood said."
345,2017-12-05T14:16:41-0500," Microsoft executive Terry Myerson said his Windows 10 PC running on a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip works for a week on one battery charge. Myerson said the initial ARM-based Windows 10 machines should be fine for many office workers, students, parents and travelers. Microsoft has long been known as an Intel and AMD shop. But on Tuesday, the company is taking the rare step of unveiling a laptop that's powered by another chip giant: Qualcomm.By selling Windows 10 PCs with Qualcomm processors, which dominate the smartphone market, Microsoft is aiming to reach a mobile audience that's been much more inclined to buy Apple and Android devices.At an event in Hawaii, Microsoft showed new laptops from Asus and HP with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835 chips that use ARM's architecture. The PCs have a modem for LTE connectivity, so they don't have to exclusively rely on WiFi networks. Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Microsoft's Windows and devices group, told CNBC that he uses his Asus NovaGo ""always connected"" convertible laptop for a week at a time on a single charge. That's very unusual at a time when most laptop and tablet batteries won't last longer than a day.""In my day at the office, I walk around with one of these PCs and a phone,"" Myerson said, adding that he doesn't bring the laptop's charging cable along with him. He said that it's similar to his Fitbit wearable device, which he charges every four or five days.While it's an experimental endeavor for Microsoft, over time this class of devices could present a challenge to AMD and Intel, whose processors have historically been the standard for Windows PCs. More than half of Intel's revenue comes from its client computing group, which includes PC and tablet chips.For Qualcomm, teaming up with Microsoft represents another potential revenue opportunity, one that takes advantage of the research and development it's done for mobile devices, Cristiano Amon, an executive vice president, told CNBC.ARM-based chips have already made their way into the laptop market. Google has been trying to improve the performance of Chromebooks that use ARM chips and there have been reports that Apple has interest in releasing Mac computers that rely on ARM silicon.The area of real uncertainty is how well many kinds of applications work on an ARM-based Windows 10 system. Myerson said iTunes and Spotify and many games ""run great"" on his Asus NovaGo. Microsoft developed a version of Office for these ""always connected"" PCs.""We looked at it and said we want it to be a native Office experience,"" Myerson said. That involved compiling the ""portions of the Office apps that are most used,"" he said.This isn't Microsoft's first time trying to build ARM-based PCs. In 2012, when Microsoft introduced the first generation of its Surface tablet, one variation packed an ARM chip and ran a new operating system called Windows RT. But a year later the company announced a $900 million write-down largely because of unsold inventory of these tablets.Microsoft first announced plans to bring Windows 10 to PCs running ARM chips a year ago, and in May it named the first six manufacturers: Asus, HP, Huawei, Lenovo, Vaio, and Xiaomi.In June, Intel warned that it may bring an intellectual property case relating to Windows 10 on Qualcomm chips, depending on how it's implemented.""We do not welcome unlawful infringement of our patents, and we fully expect other companies to continue to respect Intel's intellectual property rights,"" two Intel executives wrote in a blog post.Microsoft said in a statement that it's still working closely with Intel. ""We're excited to offer customers a broad range of great PCs and look forward to innovating with Intel in the future,"" the company said.Asus initially has two options for always-connected PCs: a $599 model with 4 gigabytes of RAM and 64 gigabytes of storage, and a $799 version with 8 gitabytes of RAM and 256 gigabytes of storage. They deliver 22 hours of battery life and 30 days of standby time.Asus CEO Jerry Shen underscored the importance of having fast connectivity.""If you have the gigabit LTE, your speed is faster than the WiFi,"" Shen told CNBC. Asus intends to release more ARM-based Windows 10 PCs in the next two years, Shen said.As for Microsoft, the company announced a Surface Pro device that comes with LTE connectivity in October, though it uses Intel silicon. Myerson wouldn't comment on whether Microsoft had future plans for a Surface using a Qualcomm chip."
346,2017-12-01T13:43:09-0500," The mouse's scroll wheel can switch between fast scrolling and moving up or down line by line. Microsoft has been making mice since 1983. It's taken three and a half decades, but Microsoft has finally made the ultimate mouse.The Bluetooth-enabled Surface Precision Mouse, which Microsoft revealed in October alongside the second generation of its high-end Surface Book convertible laptop, is very comfortable while still looking elegant. It's got six customizable buttons, a rechargeable battery, a thumb rest, and a scroll wheel that can be switched from smooth and fast vertical scrolling to granular line-by-line scrolling. And you can use it with up to three PCs at the same time.In other words, it's just right -- even if it does run on the expensive side at $100. Mice from Logitech and Razer have boasted some of its features, but none has felt this natural.While Amazon, Apple and Google are busy refining smart speakers that house their respective virtual assistants, Microsoft in recent years has focused on getting more traditional hardware right. The Surface Studio all-in-one desktop PC is an engineering marvel. The Surface tablet has spawned countless imitations. And the latest Xbox is the world's most powerful console. Office and Windows certainly bring Microsoft more revenue than Surface and Xbox products, but at the same time, the company has visibly raised its hardware standards under the leadership of Satya Nadella.In years past, certain Microsoft mice have had shortcomings. The Intellimouse, which debuted in 1996, was corded or required an unwieldy wireless receiver for the better part of a decade. The Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 6000, which arrived in 2006, was said to have strangely placed buttons. The Explorer Mini Mouse, which showed up in 2008, had no off switch. The Arc Touch Mouse, which debuted in 2010, could lie flat but was an ergonomic mess.The Surface Precision Mouse has none of these drawbacks.What it does have is a sliver of a button tucked behind the scroll wheel that makes a pleasant clunking sound when pushed. It immediately becomes obvious what role this button serves when you glide your finger on the scroll wheel. With the push of the little button, you can switch between very speedy scrolling or something a lot more precise, which can come in handy when exploring long files and websites. Scrolling in fast mode is strangely satisfying. It's like gliding your finger along a stack of fresh printer paper.If you have a Mac, you won't be able to customize the buttons, but if you're running Windows -- with the exception of the new Windows 10 S -- you'll be able to tweak their functions with the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center software. The battery inside the mouse can't be removed, but Microsoft says a single charge will last for up to three months, and you can recharge the battery with an included micro-USB cable. Unlike Apple's Magic Mouse, the port is at the front end of the mouse, so you'll still be able to use it while it's charging.Do you need a mouse like this if you have one that works perfectly well? Of course not. But this is a mouse I love to use. And if you sit in front of the computer every day like me, then you might just come to love it, too."

So have PspsiCo COO Hugh Johnston and Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson Nine of Microsoft's 12 independent board members have been appointed since Satya Nadella took over as CEO. Microsoft has elected four new members to its board of directors, bringing the total to 14.Nine of those 14 have been appointed since Satya Nadella became the company's third CEO in February 2014. Nadella has already made a significant mark on the company, emphasizing its cloud products over its highly profitable but declining Windows franchise, and getting Microsoft out of the smartphone business, among other  moves. The company's shares are up more than 70 percent since Nadella took over. The new members had all been previously announced, but were officially elected by shareholders in the company's annual meeting on Wednesday. The new members are: Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, which Microsoft acquired in June 2016 Hugh Johnston, CFO of Pepsico Penny Pritzker, a former U.S. Secretary of Commerce and founder-chairman of private investment firm PSP Capital Arne Sorenson, the CEO of Marriott International Mason Morfitt of hedge fund ValueAct has stepped down from the board as well, as expected. Morfitt was invited to join in 2014 after his firm acquired a 0.8% stake in the company in 2013. ValueAct reportedly pressured the company to replace then-CEO Steve Ballmer, and its CEO wanted Microsoft to release Office for Apple's iPad – a move that Ballmer resisted, and one of the first things Nadella did when he took over.With the new appointments, only three of Microsoft's independent board members predate Nadella's tenure: Chairman John Thompson, who joined in 2012; former Bank of America Vice Chair Charles Noski, who joined in 2003; and former BMW Chairman Helmut Panke, who also joined in 2003.

It has fallen more than 3 percent this week.Shares in China moved in and out of the black in choppy trade, with the blue-chip index down 0.39 percent and the Shanghai Composite off less than 0.1 percent.Chinese shares have been hit by volatility this week amid a string of official announcements and measures aimed at supporting the markets following a recent plunge. The heavy sell-off has raised concerns about risks posed by about $620 billion worth of shares pledged for loans.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was 0.55 percent lower, with tech shares dropping 1.9 percent.Tech firms also fell in South Korea, where the broader market fell 1.7 percent, deepening losses after the Kospi closed at its lowest level since January 2017 on Thursday.Chipmaker SK Hynix was down 1.24 percent after falling 3 percent on Thursday, and Samsung Electro-Mechanics Co Ltd was 5.58 percent lower.In Australia, shares turned down 0.31 percent after gaining modestly at the start.

A slowdown in China has been particularly worrying for policy makers and investors, hitting asset markets from stocks to currencies and commodities.Analysts at Capital Economics sounded a cautious note, suggesting that the bounce in the S&amp;P 500 index on Thursday was only temporary as investors worries about the economic outlook worsen.""The first, and most important (worry) is that Fed tightening and fading fiscal stimulus will cause the US economy to take a turn for the worse ... The second is that China's economy will continue to struggle,"" the analysts said in a note to clients.""As we have been arguing for a while now, these worries are likely to get worse over the next twelve months or so.""Investors will get a chance to check the U.S. economic pulse later Friday when the government releases third-quarter GDP data.ANZ analysts highlighted weak U.S. core durable goods data as suggesting that ""investment is not taking off, even with the apparent tailwind from tax cuts and USD repatriation.""""This indicates that the boost to GDP growth from the fiscal stimulus could be fairly transitory,"" the analysts said.In currency markets, the euro edged lower, extending weakness after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the bank's 2.6 trillion euro ($2.96 trillion) asset purchase program will end this year and interest rates could rise after next summer, despite fears about the monetary union's economic and political future.The single currency was 0.03 percent lower at $1.1371.The dollar was off 0.11 percent against the yen at 112.29 .

352,2017-11-16T09:00:00-0500," A new 15-inch option starts at $2,500 and has superb quality.  The Surface Pen will still cost an extra $100, but you probably won't want to skip it. In refreshing its Surface Book convertible laptop, Microsoft has made a device that looks and feels familiar but has significant changes inside and out.The Surface Book 2 is going to be one of the best portable Windows experiences you can buy and, with a starting price of $1,500, you'll have to open your wallet to get one. I tested the top-of-the-line model, which runs a whopping $3,300.The screen is big and about as bright, colorful and detailed as today's top-of-the-line Apple laptop displays. You can get a 13.5-inch version or, for the first time, a 15-inch display.You can touch the screen and actually get a response — unlike any MacBook — and you can detach the display from the keyboard. It's definitely a step up from the display on the first Surface Book. Artists and gamers will find plenty to like, as will professionals who just want more content on their screen.In short, Microsoft is now better equipped to compete with the best MacBooks that Apple has to offer.Plus, Microsoft has outfitted the Surface Book 2 with new Intel chips, a USB-C port, dedicated keys for adjusting the brightness of the display and support for gaming with wireless Xbox One controllers. Thanks to an improved hinge, the display doesn't wobble, which was a problem with the original version.The laptop does have are some issues.While the larger model has more screen real estate, Microsoft didn't see fit to stretch the virtual keyboard the full width of the display. Typing on it was not nearly as comfortable as using the Surface Book's excellent physical keyboard.Also, the battery doesn't last nearly as long as I had hoped. I got about seven hours and 25 minutes of battery life on a single charge, and around 8½ hours when I used Windows 10's recently added battery saver setting. That's not terrible, but it's far shy of Microsoft's promise of up to 17 hours.Given the new Surface Book's price, you would think Microsoft would include its Surface Pen stylus. But that will cost you an extra $100. Still, you'll probably want it, because the writing and drawing experience is very good, especially on the larger display.Leaving out the Pen, you're looking at $1,500 for the base-model Surface Book 2, and to get the entry-level 15-inch, you'll need to pay an additional $1,000. The most expensive Surface Book 2 comes out to $3,300.That's a big number, but it's just $100 more than the premium version of the initial Surface Book.It's not crazy to consider paying Microsoft $2,500 for a high-octane, 15-inch laptop. Apple regularly sells Macs for that much. Now Microsoft will, too."
353,2017-11-15T11:00:00-0500," Microsoft's Visual Studio Live Share service and GitHub's Teletype package for its Atom text editor let developers work together. The launches come more than a year after Amazon Web Services acquired Cloud9, a start-up that offered a cloud-based development tool that could enable pair programming. Microsoft and privately held GitHub on Wednesday are separately unveiling tools that will make it easier for programmers to pair up and get work done together. Pair programming, a concept that goes back decades, is a controversial subject in the world of software development because not all developers are comfortable with having others see them do their work.But pair programming can help organizations keep projects ticking along if one person leaves the company or takes breaks, since the other person on the team will be familiar with the current state of the project. Pairs may also find mistakes more efficiently by switching between coding and checking their partner's work. Other benefits include on-the-job training (by pairing experienced programmers with newbies), team-building and brainstorming.The new technologies from Microsoft and GitHub call to mind the real-time collaboration features of Microsoft's Office 365 and Google's G Suite — but here Microsoft and GitHub are making sure developers will be able to use the new tools in the coding environments they're used to rather than forcing them to use unfamiliar applications.With Microsoft's Visual Studio Live Share tool, developers will be able to use their own text editors or integrated development environments while collaborating. Developers will be able to install GitHub's new Teletype package for use with the start-up's open-source Atom text editor, but GitHub is also releasing software libraries that will let people build systems to enable collaboration in other programs. Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise group, is demonstrating Visual Studio Live Share on Wednesday at the company's online Connect conference. ""When we show it, it's going to set the developer world on fire with excitement,"" Guthrie said in a media briefing earlier this month. The introductions come about a year and a half after public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services acquired Cloud9, a start-up with a cloud-based development environment where people can collaborate. And earlier this year, Red Hat acquired start-up Codenvy, whose tool can be run as a cloud service or in companies' on-premises data centers.Nathan Sobo teamed up with other developers in person every day during his time at Pivotal Labs — one of a few companies known to use pair programming — before joining GitHub, where he works on Atom.  ""I just absorbed so much knowledge and got so much out of those few years that I worked in that style, that synchronous collaboration, working together at same time with someone, where you're actually discussing what you should name that method, rather than getting feedback ... three days later,"" he said. Sobo said that even he has his moments when he doesn't want a very social coding experience — but he said he contributed to the Teletype feature with an eye toward making something he would want to use on a daily basis."

355,2017-11-12T23:01:00-0500," The company says it hires several hundred MBAs a year from nearly 150 different schools in 40 countries. They are sent all over the world to work in divisions from business development and finance to marketing and human resources. Median starting salaries and signing bonuses for MBA graduates at the Redmond, Washington-based headquarters are just over $160,000. Safiya Miller had her pick of job offers from big technology companies after earning an MBA from Cornell’s Johnson Graduate School of Management in New York state.In the end, she chose Microsoft, becoming an account executive in its Bay Area offices in 2015. Her decision was clinched by the company’s legacy, and the long and varied experience of colleagues. “If I was going to move all the way out west, I wanted a team where I could learn and grow,” says Ms Miller, who until then had worked on the US East Coast and Brazil. “I wanted to learn next to [people] who have not only been in the industry for years but were also experiencing this refresh, rebirth of the company,” she says. Receive 4 weeks of unlimited digital access to the Financial Times for just $1. Few tech companies have the staying power of Microsoft. Established in 1975 before many of today’s tech founders were even born, the company is among the top-five tech hirers of MBA students from leading business schools, including Insead, the Stanford Graduate School of Business and the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.It appeals to graduates such as Ms Miller because it is good at reinventing itself. No longer seen as tied to the fate of the PC market, under Satya Nadella, its chief executive since 2014, the company has focused on offering broader services such as cloud platforms, enterprise software and artificial intelligence.That means a wider selection of jobs for business school graduates, says Chuck Edward, Microsoft’s head of global talent acquisition. MBAs are typically ambitious, technologically proficient and trained in data and analytics. They also tend to have some experience of working life — all valuable to the changing Microsoft.“With MBAs, we know what we’re going to get,” says Mr Edward. “Our demand [for MBA talent] has gone up significantly in the past two or three years.”The company says it hires several hundred MBAs a year from nearly 150 different schools in 40 countries. About two-thirds are from the US and Canada. They are sent all over the world to work in divisions from business development and finance to marketing and human resources.Median starting salaries and signing bonuses for MBA graduates at the Redmond, Washington-based headquarters are just over $160,000 for finance managers, product marketing managers and business programme and strategy managers, according to Transparent Career, a start-up that collects MBA graduates’ self-reported salary data.Microsoft’s reinvention has also led to redundancies. This year the company laid off 3,000-4,000 employees, mostly sales staff outside the US, according to the New York Times. This came after job losses three years earlier, following Microsoft’s acquisition of Nokia’s mobile business. Then, Microsoft laid off 18,000 employees, 14 per cent of its workforce, the deepest cuts in the company’s history.Mr Edward says recent job losses do not affect demand for MBA talent. This year, Microsoft hired about 30 per cent more MBAs than last, and plans to hire more. Many will be recruited from its summer internship programme. “Our goal is to convert,” Mr Edward says. “When we bring in an intern, [we want them to] become a full-time hire.”Those who want to stand out at interview should reflect Microsoft’s leadership principles — to create clarity, generate energy and deliver success, Mr Edward says. That process begins with a phone interview and those who make the next round are invited to the company’s headquarters, or another of its large office sites. They meet current employees and have a full day of interviews.The process usually lasts three to four weeks, according to Microsoft, although that can vary to fit in with business schools’ recruiting timeframes.The company visits campuses in students’ second year to recruit additional, full-time employees — a move not all big recruiters make, says Michelle Hopping, director of MBA career management at the Wharton School. Ms Hopping says Microsoft not only seeks out Wharton students at recruiting events, but also offers extracurricular activities, such as competitions and educational opportunities in the classroom.Once MBA graduates have joined the company, most participate in the Microsoft Academy for College Hires. Ms Miller was assigned two mentors through this programme when she joined. In addition to two or three big training events a year, Mach MBA members and alumni have local get-togethers every month. Ms Miller attributes many of the opportunities she received as a new hire to the Mach programme. At the end of her first year she used company funding and facilities to bring together 150 recent MBA hires from 10 tech Silicon Valley companies for a diversity event.“There’s a spirit to want to give back and do service and have a larger conversation across the company,” Ms Miller says.More from The Financial Times: Zuckerberg says he worked out why US is so divided UK chipmaker Graphcore raises $50m from Sequoia Silicon Valley sets sights on disrupting meat industry"
356,2017-12-06T03:59:23-0500," Cryptocurrency IOTA is now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization IOTA Foundation, a German non-profit firm that oversees the virtual currency, said last week it has partnered with big tech firms on a data marketplace A digital currency has added more than $12 billion to its market value after the firm behind it said it was teaming up with a number of big tech firms, including Microsoft and Samsung on a ""data marketplace.""Called IOTA, the cryptocurrency saw a spike on Wednesday, rallying more than 90 percent in the last 24 hours, according to data from industry website Coinmarketcap. Its price soared to an all-time high of $5.55 at 8:27 a.m. London time, almost doubling Tuesday's price of $2.78. It is now the fourth-largest digital asset by market capitalization, dethroning Ripple's XRP.The rally followed an announcement by the IOTA Foundation, a German non-profit firm that oversees the virtual currency, last Tuesday, that it had partnered with the likes of Microsoft, Samsung and Fujitsu on a blockchain-based marketplace that lets them sell data.David Sonstebo, IOTA's co-founder and CEO, said data is ""the new oil,"" and that the marketplace project is letting firms sell data to incentivize them to share this data that would otherwise be wasted.""At present, up to 99 percent of this precious data gathered is lost to the void,"" he told CNBC in an email. ""IOTA incentivize sharing of data through its zero fee transactions and by ensuring data integrity for free on the decentralized distributed ledger.""He added that the marketplace is currently a pilot project, and that examples of data being shared included weather and air quality data.Sonstebo said that the cryptocurrency's surge in price was due to its approach to blockchain technology and partnerships with established firms.""IOTA's seemingly 'out of nowhere' explosive growth can be traced back to the fact that it has been somewhat of a sleeping giant,"" Sonstebo said.""IOTA has resolved the three major issues of blockchain — fees, scaling limitations and centralization — and built up real-world partnerships and projects with world-leading companies since 2015.""Sonstebo added that the cryptocurrency's growth was also owed to its increased publicity.""Unlike the overwhelming majority of projects in this space, IOTA has not done any paid promo, so now that there's a steady stream of these large news stories the major technological advantages become known to the wider audience,"" he said.""I believe this is the reason for the rally, as well as the fact that IOTA just entered China and Korea, which are naturally huge markets, meaning a lot of new people buying.""A blockchain is a massive, decentralized database that records cryptocurrency transactions. Its original use-case was as the ledger for all bitcoin transactions.But IOTA's open-source blockchain platform differs to mainstream blockchain networks which use encrypted ""blocks"" to record those transactions.Instead the firm's digital ledger, inspired by internet of things technology, is ""blockless,"" and allows users to make transactions on the network for free.Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, has been faced with several splits this year due to frustration over the speed and cost of transactions.People within the bitcoin community have been pushing for an upgrade to the blockchain to increase block size and speed up the process of mining.Although the upgrade was shelved in November, some went ahead with the creation of a new bitcoin offshoot called bitcoin diamond."
357,2017-11-08T18:34:03-0500," Benioff made fun of the Surface and said Microsoft has had many executive departures. At Dreamforce, Salesforce announced an expansive partnership with Google. At Dreamforce two years ago, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella had a prime speaking spot and Salesforce's Marc Benioff touted the blossoming partnership between the two companies.Those days are gone. On Tuesday, Benioff used part of Salesforce's investor day meeting at Dreamforce to talk up Salesforce's expanded partnership with Google and its growing relationships with Amazon, Cisco, Dell and IBM. But he didn't include Microsoft in that group, even after the companies made a big deal about their work together in 2014 and again in 2015.It's a complicated relationship. Microsoft and Salesforce compete in areas like business intelligence and customer relationship management software. Beyond that, Microsoft outbid Salesforce for LinkedIn in 2016, and Microsoft previously tried to buy Salesforce.This week, Salesforce made some moves of its own onto Microsoft's turf, integrating more deeply with both Google and Facebook.At the investor meeting, Kirk Materne of Evercore asked Benioff if it would be possible for Microsoft and Salesforce to ""come back together on behalf of customers.""Here's a transcript of what Benioff said in response: No, there's always one person in the room who's using a Surface laptop, so I get that. And it's you. Who else is using a Surface laptop? Raise your hand. OK, we have three people. And how many are using Macs? Raise your hand. How many iPads? OK. How many PCs? And then we've got the three Surface. You know, look. They're 1 percent of the CRM market. You know the numbers. I like having competitors. But what I just get blown away with is how they just can't keep, you know, that management team in place. They just keep leaving Microsoft. You know that. And I think they don't have confidence in that ability to execute in that business. So that has weighed to our favor, and customers feel that. You know because you go to these conferences just like I do. There is no conference like this that they do and that's the — in my opinion, the mark. That is — why is it that they don't have anything like this? That when they put on a conference like something — it's always the resellers who come together, and then -- where are these people? Now, that isn't to say they don't have, like, Build, where they get these really high-end developers using the IDE. You know what I mean? Is that the conference I've been to where I'm like, Oh, yeah, these are all the -- and they're all Windows -- they have a Windows fever. And they have Windows API fever at the conference. But I haven't seen that in any other part of their business, other than the Windows API. Maybe they'll get it in Azure -- I don't know. But I haven't seen that yet. Because the last time that I went to the conference, I didn't see that. I only see that fever around the Windows API. And the Surface laptop. Microsoft declined to comment."

The new tool builds on previous efforts to integrate LinkedIn into Microsoft products, like showing LinkedIn contact details in Outlook. Microsoft is doing more with its big LinkedIn acquisition, and it could help you score your next job. On Wednesday the company is taking the covers off something called a Resume Assistant for its Word program. Drawing on LinkedIn data, the tool shows you how other people have described jobs that are similar to yours if you're working on a resume in Word, and it will highlight skills of people who have the job you want — along with relevant LinkedIn Learning courses through which you can pick up new skills.Plus, the tool makes the job hunt a little easier, by bringing into Word certain job openings that you might be interested in. ""Along with job openings, you'll see details of what the job requires, allowing you to tailor your resume to a specific role,"" LinkedIn senior product manager Kylan Nieh wrote in a blog post.The Resume Assistant also gives you a shortcut to turning on LinkedIn's Open Candidates feature, which tells recruiters that you're interested in learning about new job openings. Open Candidates makes you twice as likely to get contacted by recruiters, Nieh wrote.It's has been almost a year and a half since Microsoft agreed to buy LinkedIn for $26.2 billion. In April the company introduced an integration between Dynamics 365 for Sales and LinkedIn Sales Navigator, and introduced Dynamics 365 for Talent, which draws on LinkedIn's recruiting tools. More recently, Microsoft said it would start to show LinkedIn contact details in Office 365 apps like Outlook.In the most recent quarter, LinkedIn contributed $1.1 billion to Microsoft's top line."
360,2017-11-08T12:20:00-0500," Kroger is splitting its cloud investments between Microsoft and Google. The company joins other big traditional commerce companies that are trying to avoid AWS. Kroger's CIO said there's no reason ""to help grow that business for them."" As Kroger moves to cloud computing, the nation's largest grocery store chain is sending millions of dollars to Microsoft and Google.But not to Amazon.""For obvious reasons competitively, it doesn't make sense for us to do a ton to help grow that business for them,"" Chris Hjelm, Kroger's chief information officer, told CNBC in an interview. With Amazon's retail business pushing into more industries and competing more directly with a growing number of companies, Amazon Web Services is starting to experience a backlash. Kroger is joining the likes of Wal-Mart and Target in finding other vendors to handle their massive workloads for their digital and e-commerce offerings. Alphabet said in its latest earnings release that Kohl's has moved to Google's cloud.In a blog post on Monday, venture capitalist Glenn Solomon from GGV Capital underscored how pervasive this has become. Solomon said several of his firm's portfolio companies that use AWS have been asked by retail clients to ""provide a mirrored service on another cloud because they'd prefer not to have their data stored with Amazon given competitive fears.""For Kroger, that fear has become more obvious by the day. In August, Amazon bought Whole Foods for $13.7 billion and instantly cut prices at the upscale grocer. CNBC has also been reporting on Amazon's potential efforts to crack the pharmacy market, another reason for Kroger to be concerned.Kroger gets about 9 percent of sales from its more than 2,200 pharmacies.Hjelm said the company started investing heavily with Microsoft Azure and the Google Cloud late last year. With Azure, the grocer is rolling out digital shelf technology to combine the use of sensors and smartphones to alert customers about relevant deals. For e-commerce, delivery and data-focused initiatives such as smart pricing, Kroger is turning to Google. The company also uses infrastructure technology from Pivotal.Kroger does have some projects running on AWS for businesses that the company acquired. But for any new initiatives, ""that investment in growth is not going to AWS,"" Hjelm said. Regarding Microsoft and Google, ""we feel like we're not losing anything from a competitive perspective working with those companies,"" he said.If AWS is worried about Kroger representing an emerging trend, it's not showing up in the unit's financial performance or its market share.Revenue in third quarter surged 42 percent to $4.58 billion, and AWS produced $1.17 billion in operating income for a company that's used to running with little to no profit. Nordstrom, Under Armour, Lululemon and Nisa Retail in the U.K. are a few of the retailers and consumer brands that count on AWS. For cloud infrastructure as a whole, AWS controls 34 percent of the market, followed by Azure at 12 percent, IBM at 8 percent and Google at 5 percent.According to AWS, retailers will continue to use its infrastructure because they care most about agility, security and performance when deciding where to run their workloads.""AWS is the clear leader in these areas,"" a company spokesperson said in an e-mail. ""Retailers' end users don't care about any rivalry that may exist with another retailer.""Like most big established enterprises, Kroger isn't moving everything to the public cloud. The company still has many of its core computing functions and storage in its own data centers. But Hjelm said that in the cloud, Kroger has thousands of projects for testing and development running as well as live applications. He wouldn't specify how much the company is spending on the cloud, but he said it's in the millions of dollars and is split roughly equally between Microsoft and Google.""Over time that balance could shift depending on who creates more value,"" he said. Tariq Shaukat, a president in Google's cloud division, said in an interview that even if retailers have been reluctant to give Amazon their money, a lot of them have still historically run on AWS. Google is picking up customers now because its cloud platform finally has the services they need, he said.""There's an increasing recognition that GCP is a viable option and a leader in areas they care about, like security, data analytics and machine learning,"" he said."

OSAC promotes ""security cooperation between American private sector interests worldwide and the U.S. Department of State,"" according to its website.But conversation soon turned to possible risks in China prompted by the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer and ""heiress"" of Chinese telecom network equipment giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, who was detained in Canada on Dec. 1. The news of the arrest was made public on Wednesday.Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, was held at Washington's request as part of a U.S. investigation of an alleged scheme to use the global banking system to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran, people familiar with the probe said.The arrest has roiled global markets amid fears that it could further inflame the Sino-U.S. trade row.Risk consultants and analysts said that the arrest could prompt Beijing to retaliate in some form.""This will pressure a lot of Chinese officials to look strong in this dispute,"" said Nick Marro, Hong Kong-based Asia analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit, who added that technology companies were particularly at risk.""This could mean either taking a stronger stance on trade negotiations, or taking a stronger stance on U.S. tech firms in China right now.""Asked whether there would be any retaliation against any foreign executives in China, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Friday China has always protected the lawful rights of foreigners in China in accordance with the law.""Of course in China they should respect China's laws and rules.""EARLY CHRISTMAS TRIP?OSAC says it is made up of 34 private and public sector member organizations. It lists its events on its website, including the Dec. 6 meeting in Singapore. There was also a separate listed meeting held in Shanghai on the same day.Prashant Nayak, Disney's Asia Pacific director of corporate security, posted about the Singapore meeting on LinkedIn, tagging other executives at Google, Facebook, Amazon.com Inc , Marriot International Inc, Microsoft Corp and others. Nayak did not respond to a LinkedIn message seeking further comment.The second person with knowledge of the event said the Huawei arrest and potential fallout was a hot topic at the meeting.A senior diplomat from the U.S. embassy in Singapore gave opening remarks, but an embassy spokesperson said she left before any discussion.Asia-based risk consultants said they had seen a rise in the number of clients asking about the Huawei issue and potential concerns related to the impact on U.S. firms in China.Jakob Korslund, CEO of Singapore-based consultancy Deutsche Risk, said his firm had received a number of enquiries in the last two days asking about the risks of travelling to China.""For a few we have advised postponing trips that were not time critical, telling clients to wait for the next few weeks to see the situation,"" he said.James McGregor, chairman of APCO Worldwide's Greater China region, said companies would likely err on the side of not sending executives to China for the time being.""It's all about avoiding risk, because what do you do if somebody is arrested?"" he told Reuters, adding anxiety was also spreading among executives already in China.""People are joking about it a little bit and saying 'maybe I should take an early Christmas trip home'.""

Her departure comes a few months after she stepped back from her role to recover from a surgery. Microsoft on Tuesday confirmed that a longtime executive, Julie Larson-Green, is leaving the company. The news comes a few months after Larson-Green stepped back from her role as chief experience officer for Office productivity as she was recovering from surgery.Larson-Green joined Microsoft in 1993, a year after the arrival of the company's current CEO, Satya Nadella. She was once seen as a potential candidate to replace former CEO Steve Ballmer, but Nadella was ultimately chosen for that task.Larson-Green has held top roles in Microsoft's Windows and hardware groups, but most recently she was focused on Office in the age of the cloud. She was one of Microsoft's most prominent female executives. Tuesday is her last day there.""We thank Julie for the numerous contributions she's made to Microsoft over the last 25 years, and we wish her the very best in her new endeavors,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email.  ZDNet previously reported the news.Larson-Green's role was leading ""engineering and design of the Office productivity experiences that make it easy for people to access information, connect with others and accomplish tasks across all their devices,"" she wrote on her LinkedIn profile. Larson-Green previously worked under another Microsoft veteran, Steven Sinofsky, until Sinofsky left his position as head of Windows in 2012. At that point she took over Windows software and hardware engineering. tweetLast year Larson-Green told Business Insider that she was the one who removed the Clippy virtual assistant from Office apps like Microsoft Word in 2007. ""We were just ahead of our time with the technology,"" she said.In May, The Information said that most of the people who had been reporting to Larson-Green will now report to company veteran Jeff Teper, corporate vice president of Office, OneDrive and SharePoint."
367,2019-01-15T13:04:09-0500,"Attorney general nominee William Barr said he doesn't think ""big is necessarily bad,"" but he wants to understand how tech giants have gotten so big under current laws.Barr was on the board of Time Warner during the company's legal proceedings to merge with AT&amp;T, making the issue of antitrust a personal one.Tech companies have faced intense scrutiny from lawmakers because of privacy and platform manipulation scandals.William Barr told U.S. senators in his confirmation hearing for attorney general on Tuesday that regulators need to take a deeper look at the ""huge behemoths"" in tech.""The purpose of the antitrust laws, obviously, is to protect competition,"" Barr, who previously served as attorney general in the administration of President George H.W. Bush, said in response to a question from Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT). Barr said that competition is ultimately good for consumers, but he suggested that he needs to look more into the topic.""At the same time, I'm sort of interested in stepping back and reassessing, or learning more about how the antitrust division has been functioning and what their priorities are,"" said Barr. ""I don't think big is necessarily bad, but I think a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers. You can win that place in the marketplace without violating the antitrust laws, but I want to find out more about that dynamic.""U.S. tech companies Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook are five of the six most valuable companies in the world. Over the past year, lawmakers have called for greater regulation of the industry as privacy and platform manipulation scandals have rankled Silicon Valley. Executives from Facebook, Twitter and Google have all testified in front of congress, about what they're doing to get back on track.Barr made it clear in his testimony that he is interested in a number of issues pertinent to tech companies. In response to a question from Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) about the Justice Department's role is in terms of working with the Federal Trade Commission to address anti-competitive behavior.""I would like to weigh in to some of these issues,"" Barr said. ""I'd like to have the antitrust [division] support that effort to get more involved in reviewing the situation from a competition standpoint. I also am interested in the issue of privacy. And the question of who owns this data. And, you know, it's not an area that I've studied closely or become an expert in. But I think it's important for the department to get more involved in these questions.""Barr acknowledged he still doesn't have the solutions to these questions, including about whether the Justice Department has the authority to address alleged bias on online platforms. He said he'd ""have to think long and hard before I said that it was really the stuff of an antitrust matter."" But he also expressed concern over the ""network effects"" that have allowed tech companies to become ""so powerful that particular sectors could essentially be subsumed into these networks.""Whoever is confirmed as attorney general could play a key role in shaping the enforcement of antitrust regulation in the coming years.Barr is plenty familiar with the topic, as he recently battled the Justice Department over the proposed merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner, where he was a board member. As part of the merger litigation, Barr filed an affidavit saying he was disappointed in the ""inexplicable"" opposition by the Justice Department's leadership given President Donald Trump's ""prior public animus towards CNN and this merger,"" according to The Washington Post.Barr has said that if confirmed he would recuse himself from the Time Warner-AT&amp;T case. A lower court had approved the merger in June, but the Justice Department filed an appeal in July.Hawley asked Barr if he sees ""similar concerns"" to those the Justice Department raised against the Time Warner/AT&amp;T merger ""regarding how Silicon Valley firms could use their market power and social media or search to discriminate against rival products or services and viewpoints.""

""Our overall macro view [is] that a premium is going to continue to get placed on these high-growth companies in a low-growth world.""Some of the segment's biggest names, including Adobe, Salesforce.com, PayPal and Microsoft, trade at an elevated valuation compared with the rest of the market. Salesforce, for example, trades at 54 times forward earnings, well above the S&amp;P 500's 15 times multiple.Two software stocks illustrate how the group as a whole should continue its breakout, says Wald.""First, the software company Salesforce made a higher low in December, while the rest of the market was selling off and fell to that extreme bottom,"" said Wald. ""Now, as the market turns higher, you're starting to see Salesforce come out of the consolidation pattern it's been in.""Salesforce has added 4.5 percent in the past three months as the S&amp;P 500 tumbled 6 percent. The company is still 8 percent off its October record high.""Also, mobile payments company PayPal, breaking through multimonth resistance in a difficult market tape — we think that is telling. That's the type of relative strength that we think you want to own,"" said Wald.PayPal has had an even better stretch over the past three months. The stock has surged 18 percent over that period in one of the best performers of the S&amp;P 1500 software and services segment.Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, says Google parent Alphabet is a better bet.""I kind of want to stay defensive, and I really like Google,"" Schlossberg said on ""Trading Nation"" on Monday. ""It's held pretty well in this very, very soggy tape.""While Schlossberg says its advertising business continues to thrive, the real potential is in artificial intelligence.""They are leaders in artificial intelligence,"" he said. ""Some analysts think there could be a $20 billion hardware business going forward for them in artificial intelligence. That's a story that the market really isn't fully appreciating.""Alphabet has fallen 2.5 percent in the past three months. Its stock is in a correction, having fallen 17 percent from its record high set in August. Any drop of more than 10 percent from 52-week highs indicates correction territory. The company is now listed in the communications services S&amp;P 500 sector rather than technology."
370,2017-10-26T16:08:30-0400," Microsoft reached its goal of a $20 billion revenue run rate for commercial cloud in this quarter. Commercial growth of Office 365 helped push Office commercial products and cloud services up 10 percent. Microsoft stock was up more than 4 percent on Thursday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter of its 2018 fiscal year, which ended on September 30.  EPS: Excluding certain items, 84 cents vs. 72 cents as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue:  $24.54 billion vs. $23.56 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.   Perhaps the company's biggest achievement in this quarter is exceeding its self-imposed goal of a $20 billion in annualized revenue run rate for its commercial cloud business -- which includes the Azure cloud, the Office 365 subscription-based application suite and Dynamics 365 apps for customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning. The company came up with a $20.4 billion commercial cloud run rate for the quarter, according to the company's earnings statement.KeyBanc analysts Brent Bracelin, Clarke Jeffries and Alyssa Johnson noted earlier this week that they were expecting the milestone either this quarter or the next one. The annualized run rate figure is calculated by multiplying revenue for the last month of the quarter by 12.""Reaching $20 billion would imply the commercial cloud mix could cross over 20 percent of revenue for the first time in 1Q18, up from 5 percent in early 2015,"" the KeyBanc analysts wrote. The annualized run rate figure is calculated by multiplying revenue for the last month of the quarter by 12.The company beat analysts' expectations in all three of its business segments, according to StreetAccount.Revenue from Azure was up 90 percent year over year, and commercial revenue for Office 365 subscriptions was up 42 percent. (As a whole, Microsoft's revenue was up 12 percent.) Stifel analysts Brad Reback and Adam Borg were expecting Azure -- which is larger than Google's cloud and second only to Amazon Web Services -- to generate $1.3 billion in revenue, which would have been up 90 percent year over year.In keeping with previous quarters, Azure compute usage more than doubled in the quarter, CEO Satya Nadella told analysts on a conference call after the earnings release. PiperJaffray analysts Alex Zukin, Scott Wilson and Taylor Reiners had expected 30 percent growth in Office 365 commercial revenue, which would have been down from more than 40 percent in revenue growth in the past two years. Microsoft got 10 percent more revenue from Office commercial products and cloud services, which includes Office 365 as well as its more traditional Office software. Microsoft ended the quarter with 28 million Office 365 consumer subscribers, up from 27 million from the previous quarter.Gaming revenue of $1.9 billion was up 1 percent, as Microsoft prepares for the launch of the Xbox One X console on Nov. 7. A decline in gaming hardware revenue was offset by an increase in Xbox software and services revenue, CFO Amy Hood said on the conference call. The KeyBanc analysts had expected $1.64 billion in gaming revenue.LinkedIn revenue of $1.1 billion for the quarter was flat sequentially. As for Windows, revenue from companies putting Pro versions of the operating system on devices was up by 4 percent. The KeyBanc analysts had expected a 1 percent decline.Microsoft's Surface hardware revenue was up 12 percent for the quarter, following the introduction of the Surface Laptop in June. Search ad revenue was up by 15 percent, as the company saw higher search volume, as well as more revenue per search. In terms of guidance, Hood said the company expects to report $27.8-28.6 billion in revenue in its fiscal second quarter, which will end on Dec. 31. Analysts were expecting the company to guide to $28.15 billion in revenue for that quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. Office 365 commercial growth will continue to outpace the decline of the transactional Office business, Hood said. Microsoft will increase its capital expenditures ""to meet growing demand and capacity needs"" in the fiscal second quarter, Hood said.  Microsoft stock is up about 27 percent since the beginning of the year. In its fiscal first quarter the company acquired Cycle Computing, introduced the Azure Container Instances cloud service and said it was working on an artificial intelligence chip for a future version of its HoloLens mixed reality headset."

The suit argued that the government's actions were in violation of the Fourth Amendment, which establishes the right for people and businesses to know if the government searches or seizes their property, and the company's First Amendment right to free speech.The changes will ensure that secrecy order requests are ""carefully and specifically tailored to the facts in the case,"" Smith said.""This is an important step for both privacy and free expression. It is an unequivocal win for our customers, and we're pleased the DOJ (Department of Justice) has taken these steps to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans,"" the statement said.While Microsoft has agreed to drop its lawsuit, Smith said the company is renewing its call to Congress for the amendment of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act which was adopted in 1986.The DOJ did not respond to request for comment outside regular business hours.Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the Trump administration's appeal of a lower court's ruling preventing federal prosecutors from obtaining emails stored in Microsoft computer servers in Dublin, Ireland in a drug trafficking investigation.Government lawyers argued the lower court ruling threatened national security and public safety."

That has piled pressure on the oil-dependent economies of OPEC nations and forced a round of production cuts this year.On Tuesday, Baker Hughes GE CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said ""continuous disruption"" in the oil and gas industry should be viewed positively.Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that Omar Saleh believes AI will have the greatest technological impact on the oil and gas industry over the coming years."
375,2017-10-20T09:00:00-0400," The Harman Kardon Invoke is the first smart speaker with Microsoft's smart assistant, Cortana, built in. The Invoke isn't as good as the Google Home or Amazon Echo, CNBC's Todd Haselton says. The Harman Kardon Invoke is Microsoft's answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Home, but it isn't as good as those products.Microsoft didn't build its own smart speaker — as Amazon and Google did — but instead decided to outsource the hardware to Harman Kardon, an established player in the audio market. It's a towering speaker that fires 360-degree audio around the room and has built-in microphones to accept voice commands for Cortana.You can ask it things like ""what's the weather?"" and ""How tall is the Empire State Building?"" Or you can give it commands, like ""Remind me to pick up orange juice when I leave work.""The Invoke serves as a pretty decent speaker and easily filled the downstairs of my house with music. It sounds far better than the original Echo and the Google Home and looks more sophisticated than both.It's also pretty good at listening to commands, even when the speaker is playing, which is important. Google and Amazon have been able to do this pretty well, too, so the Invoke doesn't really stand out here.I like the dial on top, a direct copy of the volume controls on the Amazon Echo. It also has a soft glowing light that dances around the top when you give a command. A fun little touch: If you tap the top of the speaker, the Invoke will give you a random factoid.The Invoke can read out calendar reminders if you use Microsoft's Office 365 products, but it didn't work with my corporate Exchange account or Google Calendar. Microsoft said it plans to bring in additional calendars. I also liked asking it to read out the news in the morning, though this is something the Echo and Google Home can do just as well.The Invoke can be used to send reminders to the Cortana app on a smartphone. The feature worked well when I asked for a reminder to pick up orange juice, and I saw it pop up on my phone in the Cortana app.The Invoke also serves as a phone. Skype powers the experience but an unlisted number appears when you dial, so the receiver might not know it's you trying to call.Finally, you can use the Invoke to control smart devices in your house. It worked just fine for turning my Philips Hue lightbulbs on and off, which is really the only smart gadget I control by voice.The Invoke left a sour taste in my mouth that I couldn't shake. It wasn't always reliable and lacked so many features available in other products.For instance, I left the speaker playing while I hung out in my living room working and, on numerous occasions, music from Spotify completely stopped playing.Unlike the Echo and the Google Home, you can't use the Invoke to order products from grocery stores. That might sound unnecessary if you haven't used the Home or the Echo, but it's really convenient to walk through the living room and quickly ask to order toilet paper or other toiletries, and I missed that option.You can only listen to three music services right now: iHeartRadio, TuneIn and Spotify. That should cover a lot of folks but leaves out Pandora, the most popular streaming option, and other heavy hitters like Google Play Music and Apple Music.One more thing: The cord that plugs into the bottom of the Invoke is super short, which means you need to keep it close to an outlet. It's a weird design decision.Finally, unlike Google Home and Amazon Echo, the Invoke doesn't support multiroom audio, so you can't buy multiple units and play the same song in different rooms of your house. That's one of the best new features of the Echo and Home, and it's possible Harman Kardon might add this in an update.I really wanted to like the Invoke but I just couldn't warm up to it. As a Windows user, seamless integration with Cortana and my computer seemed really neat. I just wish it could do more and that it was more stable.It doesn't stand out against the more affordable Google Home or the Echo, the latter of which is getting a refresh this month with a new $99 model that's supposed to offer better audio. You can buy two of those (or four Google Home Minis, or four Echo Dots) for the price of the Invoke and still have almost all of the same features. You'll also gain multiroom audio, the ability to order products by voice and integration with hundreds of apps and services, including more music options.If you're chasing great audio, you might want to consider the Sonos One instead. It has Amazon Alexa built in and sounds better. Plus you can add multiple Sonos products to create a multiroom effect.Microsoft needs to play in this space. Apple's HomePod is coming out this year and, if Microsoft sat still, it would be the odd-ball out. It's on the right path with the Invoke, but still lags behind the pack."
376,2017-10-18T11:26:46-0400," SRC Labs transferred some patent rights to the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe in August. The tribe filed lawsuits against Microsoft and Amazon, claiming patent infringement. The tribe attracted attention last month after Allergan partnered with it, assigning the rights to the drug Restasis to the tribe. The Allergan deal has drawn scrutiny from competitors and lawmakers. On Monday, a Texas judge invalidated Allergan's patents on Restasis, saying the patents cover obvious ideas. Allergan plans to appeal. The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, which captured headlines last month for its unusual patent deal with drugmaker Allergan, is doubling down in the patent space, Wednesday filing lawsuits against Microsoft and Amazon claiming patent infringement.The tribe is a co-plaintiff with small tech firm SRC Labs, which claims the tech giants have been infringing its patents on data processing technologies for years. The company and the tribe are seeking damages and royalties.SRC transferred the patents to the tribe in early August, a month before the tribe's partnership with Allergan captured national headlines. Native American tribes possess sovereign immunity to patent challenges through a system known as inter partes review, and the partnerships with both Allergan and SRC are designed to shield the patents from those challenges.The Allergan partnership drew backlash from at least nine members of Congress, with one, Sen. Claire McCaskill, introducing legislation seeking to abrogate tribal sovereign immunity in this context.Allergan said it struck the deal with the tribe to avoid the ""double jeopardy"" of defending its patents, on the blockbuster eye drug Restasis, in both the federal court system and through IPR challenges from generic-drug makers. Monday, a federal court judge invalidated the patents. Allergan said it will appeal.The partnership with the SRC is designed to protect the patents from a counter-challenge from Microsoft and Amazon through the IPR system. Critics of IPR say it can tie patent holders up in perpetual legal limbo as challengers file repeated complaints, whereas patent challenges through federal courts are decisive. Proponents of IPR say it's vital for dismantling bad patents.The tribe says its patent partnerships are part of its efforts to economically diversify, noting gaming revenue from a casino it operates has leveled off in recent years, and that it has significant health and economic challenges in its community. In the Allergan partnership, the pharmaceutical company paid the tribe $13.75 million after transferring the patent rights and then licensing them back exclusively.The terms of the deal with SRC weren't immediately known.""To overcome these economic disadvantages, the tribe took steps to diversify its economy with investments in innovative business and various enterprises to foster jobs and entrepreneurship,"" the tribe said in its complaint against Microsoft, filed Wednesday morning in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The Amazon complaint was filed in the same court.The tribe also said it's creating a technology and innovation center to promote modernization of its businesses, create revenue and jobs and ""promote the education of Mohawks in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math.""Microsoft and Amazon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment."

The smaller Surface Book 2 starts at $1,499, the same price as its predecessor, and the larger version starts at $2,499.The launch comes a couple of weeks after Google introduced the 12.3-inch Pixelbook convertible laptop, its most powerful Chromebook yet. That product starts at $999. The 13-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,299, and the 15-inch model starts at $2,399.In addition to the refreshed Surface Book, Microsoft makes the Surface Laptop, the Surface Studio all-in-one PC and the Surface Pro series of convertible tablets. But the Surface Book receives more hours of use per week on average than any other Surface product, Panay said.The laptops can be configured with Intel's new eighth-generation Coffee Lake quad-core Core i7 processors, although the smaller model can be ordered with a seventh-generation Core i5 chip. The larger model lets people play games with a wirelessly connected Xbox controller. The 13.5- and 15-inch Surface Book 2 come with a USB-C port for the first time but retain Microsoft's proprietary Surface Connect charging ports."

Google, which open-sourced the popular TensorFlow AI framework, is not involved at this point. For the second time in recent months, Amazon and Microsoft are teaming up in artificial intelligence, with Google on the sidelines for now.On Thursday the two companies rolled out new tools that will make it easier for developers to use open-source artificial intelligence software. This follows the companies' move in August to let its virtual assistants Alexa and Cortana talk with each other as needed.Getting into the technical weeds, developers can use Gluon, a Python-based application programming interface, to more easily work with MXNet, the AI framework backed by public cloud market leader Amazon Web Services. And in the near future Gluon will make it easier for developers to use the Cognitive Toolkit, the framework that Microsoft open-sourced in 2015. The two companies are publishing the specifications for Gluon so that other frameworks can adopt it, too.Google is the elephant in the room here.

It's starting at $499 for the 32 GB version and we think that's a pretty darn good price. It's twice the amount of storage as a competing tablet for the same price,'' Sinofsky said, referring to the cheapest model of Apple's latest full-sized iPad.Panos Panay, the head of the Surface project, gave a spirited demonstration of the tablet's features, beaming video and music to other screens, showing off the ultra-thin cover that doubles as a keyboard, and hooking up a camera to the device's USB port. He even dropped the device on the floor to demonstrate its durability.Early reviews of the Surface tablet have been mixed, with praise for its hardware, but concerns about battery life and the limited software and applications available.NEW DEPARTUREWhile Windows 7 was introduced three years ago, Windows 8 represents the biggest change in Microsoft's user interface since Windows 95 came out 17 years ago.The radical redesign, which dispenses with the Start button and features square tiles for apps, may surprise some users.Sinofsky sought to quell fears by emphasizing that the new system was built on the base of Windows 7, Microsoft's best-selling software that recently passed 670 million license sales.Even so, early user reaction has been lukewarm.``Enough consumers don't know where to go; they are still confused by Windows 8,'' said Richard Doherty from technology consulting firm The Envisioneering Group, speaking at the New York event. ``There were no developers here (at the event). I don't know if developers will embrace it.''Initial demand for Windows 8 appeared solid, but customers are wary of spending money on unnecessary technology in the tight economy.``We've seen steady pre-order sales on Windows 8 devices from early adopters,'' said Merle McIntosh, senior vice president of product management at online electronics retailer Newegg. ``However, we expect that most average consumers are waiting until after launch to make a purchase decision.''Microsoft is offering several versions of the new system. The basic Windows 8, the full Windows 8 Pro and Windows 8 Enterprise for large organizations will all run on the traditional PCs, laptops and new tablets using Intel Corp chips. Windows RT is a new version of Windows that will be pre-installed on its Surface tablet and other devices using low-power chips designed by ARM Holdings Plc.Through the end of January, users running Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 can download an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro for $40.Microsoft has not said how many apps Windows 8 will have at the launch, but it is expected to be a fraction of the 275,000 available to iPad users. The New York Times Co announced a reader app for Windows 8 on Thursday and Amazon.com Inc launched a Kindle e-book app for the new system, but some big names such as Facebook Inc are not expected to feature.Businesses are not expected to be early adopters of Windows 8, but some feel the new crop of tablets running Office applications could counter the iPad.``Enterprise IT will do anything to not have to deploy iPads. There are development costs, new software they don't really understand,'' said Patrick Moorhead, founder of technology analysis firm Moor Insights and Strategy. ``Enterprise will more likely pick a Windows 8 tablet. (This) is going stop rollout of iPads in its tracks.''Investors were uncertain about the prospects for the success of Windows 8, but many feel a solid launch could help Microsoft's stock, which has languished between $20 and $30 for much of the last decade.Apple's shares have significantly outperformed Microsoft's over the past 10 years and its market value is now more than double Microsoft's. Microsoft shares were up 0.3 percent at $27.99 on Thursday afternoon, while Apple shares were down 0.8 percent at $611.70.``This really is about debunking the notion that Microsoft is a dinosaur and they are relevant in a new climate of tablets and mobile,'' said Todd Lowenstein, portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management, which holds Microsoft shares.``Extreme pessimism and almost utter failure is priced into the shares, so any kind of positive delivery on units, customer perception, would be really beneficial to the stock.''"

The world's largest software company is making a ""big, multi-million dollar investment"" to create a ""decent-sized media operation,"" said Bob Visse, general manager, MSN Product Management Group.  Microsoft sold its 50 percent stake in news website MSNBC.com in July to longtime partner NBCUniversal, now majority-owned by Comcast Corp .  MSNBC's newsroom at Microsoft's campus in Redmond, Washington is being wound down, while MSN builds up a news team at its nearby Bellevue offices.  MSN will chiefly aggregate news from sources such as Reuters, a unit of Thomson Reuters Corp , the Associated Press and NBC, but it will also produce its own content, Visse said. He did not say how many journalists the news site would employ.  Microsoft's flagship website, which gets about 480 million visitors per month worldwide, is one of the biggest portals on the Internet, alongside Yahoo and AOL , and serves as the gateway to other Microsoft online services such as Outlook mail and Skype online calling.  The site is being radically overhauled for Microsoft's touch-optimized Windows 8 system and Internet Explorer 10, which will be launched on Oct. 26. The new look is designed to appeal to tablet and touch-screen PC users, who can manipulate large icons across the screen and tap on items they want to read.  For the first time, the site will have a uniform look across all its sections, from news and sports to money and job listings.  Microsoft's foray into news reflects the company's growing interest in creating its own content.

Two technology companies seeking to go public, Lyft and Uber, are awaiting feedback on confidential filings from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, and unprocessed paperwork has been forming a backlog for the agency, an attorney told CNBC this week.Software companies that could get hit the hardest are those whose fiscal quarters end in December, and those that derive a meaningful percentage of revenue from government business, Morgan Stanley analysts led by Keith Weiss wrote in a note distributed to clients on Jan. 3. The analysts assembled a list of software companies with high government exposure and put cybersecurity company ForeScout on top, as they believe it generates 28 percent of its revenues from federal, state and local government agencies. Pivotal was the second on the list, at 19 percent. (Morgan Stanley later corrected its note, lowering Pivotal's exposure to under 10 percent, putting it further down the list.)Many companies don't specify how much money they get from government business.

That program, commonly called DACA, shields immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children from deportation.The Department of Homeland Security recently said it would phase out the program. President Trump has wavered on the issue and said in September that there would be no action for six months, but that it was the job of Congress to legalize DACA.Smith is one of many technology executives to support letting DACA recipients stay in the U.S., the only home that many of the immigrants have known. But legislators needs to take up discussions soon, Smith said.""It should be possible to move quickly and use a quicker victory to build momentum on Capitol Hill to then accomplish bigger and more substantial things,"" he said.On the issue of tax reform, Smith's position is more in sync with Republican leadership.Smith said that Microsoft, like many exporters, is looking forward to a large tax package enacted in the coming months. President Trump has pledged to temporarily relieve taxes on the repatriation of profits that are stashed overseas, which could allow companies like Microsoft to invest money domestically or return cash to shareholders.""We basically have a tax system in this area that was designed in 1961, and it creates economic incentives to keep profits offshore,"" Smith said. ""We could make good business decisions free of the artificial constraint of a tax rule that we've been living with for over five decades."" Smith spoke from The Cambridge Cyber Summit, presented by the Aspen Institute and CNBC. Technology companies are often at odds with the government over the handling of cybersecurity. Most notably,  Apple spent much of 2016 battling the FBI over allowing government access to encrypted devices, commonly called a ""backdoor.""""The last thing we should do is to create a backdoor,"" Smith said. ""It leaves law enforcement challenges, and that then gets to a more complicated, and sometimes nuanced, discussion."" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently told CNBC that cybersecurity is ""top of mind"" for Microsoft, as society comes to terms with regulating the ""dark side"" of technology. Over the past 15 years, the company has developed a system to view what's happening at more than 1 billion endpoints in its cloud in real time. The company uses those insights to prevent malicious code from spreading across software like Outlook and Office.While the U.S. government's stance on encryption has improved considerably from a year ago, according to Smith, he said that he feels worse about the nation's cybersecurity. Nation-states are creating more sophisticated and varied attacks and cybercriminals are hacking to make money, Smith said.""In all honesty, I probably feel worse, rather than better,"" Smith said. ""It's less about a specific conversation with a specific government and more about the rising tide of attacks that we're seeing.""     "

391,2017-10-02T15:29:30-0400," Satya Nadella once had to give up his green card so he could get an H1-B visa so his wife could come to the U.S. When he was in the running to replace Steve Ballmer as Microsoft CEO, Ballmer advised him to go against common wisdom and be himself, rather than pretending to be more aggressive than he naturally was. When his son Zain was born with cerebral palsy, it forced Satya to change how he looks at relationships. Satya Nadella is the third CEO of Microsoft. He's also a husband and a father of special-needs kids. He's an immigrant.And he's pretty close to doing something that, until he took the job just over three and a half years ago, most people in tech – heck, most people at Microsoft – thought was impossible.That near-impossible task is a cultural revival of a once-dominant tech giant that was losing its grip on its soul. Under Nadella's leadership morale is up, and so is product quality and the stock price. The question is whether all of that can stick.Satya sat down with me at the Nasdaq Marketsite in Times Square in New York, where he stopped through to promote his new book, ""Hit Refresh,"" about the revival he's attempting at Microsoft. The conversation for my Fortt Knox podcast offers a fresh look at one of the most influential technology leaders in the world today, who's engineering a cultural rebirth few thought possible – while also being a dad who faces some unique challenges helping his kids reach their full potential.To do it all, he's made some decisions that go directly against popular wisdom. Some highlights:As a young engineer at Microsoft, Nadella faced a quandary. He was ready to start a family – but with his green card, he wouldn't be able to bring his wife Anu over to the United States. An immigration lawyer at Microsoft suggested a move that seemed ridiculous: Give up his coveted green card, and get an H1-B visa, which allows spouses to enter the U.S. I asked him about the story he recounts in the book, and how it influences the way he looks at today's immigration debate.""A comprehensive immigration reform—that again, speaks to our interests as a nation, what makes us stronger, what makes us more competitive, I think is much needed,"" Nadella said. ""The idea that you have to give up your green card to get an H1-B is, in retrospect, silly. And so therefore let us in fact take the reform so that it works for us, both our security but as well as our competitiveness.""When he was one of several candidates to be the next CEO, one of the Microsoft board members who would pick the successor pulled him aside. If you want the job, he said, you have to act more like you're really hungry for it. Outgoing CEO Steve Ballmer dismissed that notion, saying it's too late to act like a different person now.""It was not like we were sitting around, thinking that Steve is going to retire. So it was a shock. And the board did the right thing, which is they looked far and wide,"" Nadella said. ""When they came and talked to me and they said, 'Do you wanna be CEO,' I was honest. I said, 'Only if you want me to be CEO.'""That goes against all the advice in the business books, self-help books, and self-esteem books. But Nadella wasn't lacking in confidence – he was just bringing a different style, a different humility, to the job.One of the more personal angles in Hit Refresh – and in my conversation with Nadella – concerns his journey as a father. His son Zain was born with cerebral palsy, a challenge that forced him to change the way he looks at relationships not only at home, but also at work.""A few years went by and then I realized nothing happened to me. Something happened to Zain,"" Nadella said. ""What's my responsibility as a father? I think that was perhaps one of, you know, the big hit refresh moments when I look back for me personally, that has influenced. And so, I think it's our life's experience that then leads into work, and work's experience that leads into life. And it's one of those things where, it has to be lived. We can't be taught about it.""Today's corporate cultures can sometimes glorify a take-no-prisoners approach; but that's not the only way."
392,2019-01-11T01:00:00-0500,"NEW YORK/HONG KONG, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is considering paying big multinational corporations more for their deposits than other banks as it paves the way for its entry into a mundane but prized business: managing cash.The global investment banking powerhouse and fifth-largest U.S. bank, which is six months into building the required technology, aims to start the service in the first half of 2020, according to two people familiar with the plan. They agreed to discuss internal strategy on the condition they not be named.The bank, which will earn fees and gain a captive client base for its foreign exchange business, could offer existing corporate clients more on deposits if they sign up for Goldman's cash management services, a person familiar with the plan told Reuters.Long considered a low-margin, utility-like service, the wholesale payments and cash management business generated about $250 billion in global revenue in 2017 for big banks, according to management consulting firm Oliver Wyman.The steady stream of income has grown more attractive to banks that have been shifting away from volatile areas such as trading and investment banking in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago.Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Bank of New York Mellon Corp, HSBC Holdings PLC, Standard Chartered PLC and Deutsche Bank AG currently dominate the market, handling corporations' payments and receivables across different regions.As Goldman seeks to grow stable revenue by adding a cash management service for clients whom it already offers hedging and strategic advice, the investment bank further evolves to match rival universal banks' range of businesses.Goldman Sachs is about half way to a goal management set in 2017 to generate $5 billion more in annual revenue by next year, largely by boosting reliable, fee-based businesses. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/2H81K9a) However, rivals privately scoff at the idea Goldman can gain significant market share in a business where contracts often last five years, clients tend to stick with their banks and a global network of banking licenses greases the wheels.""The regulatory and operational costs of building a global cash management platform will be very steep and will take many years to achieve the scale that will justify the costs,"" said a senior commercial banker at a large European bank.""Large multinational companies are consolidating the number of banks they deal with, and they don't tend to switch service providers frequently for workday functions like facilitating supplier payments and managing payrolls.""FIRST CLIENTNonetheless, Goldman believes it can make inroads.Its investment bankers have heard corporate treasurers at big U.S. multinational corporations complain that other banks' systems are clunky and outdated, one person familiar with Goldman's plans said. Goldman will try to woo those accounts with a user-friendly interface and other improvements, and eventually hopes to be the third or fourth bank corporate clients use, in addition to other banks, for cash management.Later this year, Goldman will become its own first client by moving its deposits from other banks onto its own cash management platform.Goldman stands to earn money from cash management in three ways: fees earned for processing funds, fees earned on exchanging a client's cash into other currencies during a transaction, and by using deposits as operational account balances, a cheaper alternative to wholesale funding.Oliver Wyman predicts that wholesale payments and cash management revenue will grow 5 percent annually over the next five years. Growing volumes and rising interest rates will more than offset narrowing profit margins caused by increased competition, the consulting firm said.Paying clients more for deposits and offering new technology is a strategy Goldman used when it launched Marcus, its online retail bank, in 2016.It has paid off. Marcus had $30 billion of deposits in the United States and the United Kingdom and $4 billion in loans as of November, and is contributing about $200 million to Goldman's revenue, according to a November presentation.In recent months, Goldman has advertised that it is hiring cash management compliance, technology, and legal professionals.In one LinkedIn post seeking applications for lead data architect in the commercial banking engineering team, Goldman said it was looking for ""innovative solutions to traditional banking activities"" by combining the ""heritage of a 148-year-old financial institution with the agility and entrepreneurial spirit of a tech start-up.""(Reporting by Elizabeth Dilts in New York and Sumeet Chatterjee in Hong Kong Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Tomasz Janowski)"

""That's where the criticism comes from, not in terms of anything else.""American technology reached India-born Nadella when he was growing up, he said, and helped him ""dream the dream,"" and after immigrating to the U.S., he came to ""live the dream.""Fortt asked Nadella about the recent expansion of the company's Artificial Intelligence and Research group from 5,000 to 8,000 people, at a time when Alphabet, Facebook and other companies have also been investing in AI research.""In some sense that's the existential question for us,"" Nadella said.

You will need to come up with the next thing.""The company's researchers had been exploring AI, and specifically speech recognition, for many years, Nadella said. ""It was in 1995,"" he said, ""when Bill said, 'You know, this speech recognition thing is going to be important -- let's get started.'"" If anything, he said, it's about taking a long-term approach and then ""seizing these market opportunities when they arrive.""Fortt also asked Nadella about whether it's risky to let Microsoft's Cortana voice assistant talk with Amazon's Alexa. But there are ""probably, what, 5, 10 million"" voice-first devices, Nadella replied. ""It's just minuscule.

395,2017-09-25T09:00:00-0400," Microsoft launches updates to Azure that AWS already has, including hardware for transferring massive amounts of data without using the internet, and reserved computing resources. AWS held 34 percent of the market for cloud infrastructure services in the second quarter, and Azure, its closest competitor, had 11 percent, Microsoft on Monday announced updates to its Azure public cloud that make it a more formidable challenger to market leader Amazon Web Services.Microsoft unveiled a piece of hardware full of hard drives that companies can fill up with data before sending it off to Microsoft data centers. Companies would use this service for sending massive amounts of data they want Microsoft to host, but that would be too slow or costly to upload over the internet. AWS did something like that in 2015.Microsoft is also introducing a service that will ease the migration of databases from on-premises data centers into its cloud, and it will start letting people reserve computing resources for future use — at lower prices than they would ordinarily pay. AWS announced a database migration service in 2015 and reserved instances in 2009.And following the 2016 introduction of AWS' Shield service, which stops applications from being overwhelmed by distributed denial-of-service attacks, Microsoft is now coming out with a comparable tool — the same technology that Microsoft uses to keep Office 365 and Xbox Live running.AWS held 34 percent of the market for cloud infrastructure services in the second quarter, and Azure, its closest competitor, had 11 percent, according to Synergy Research Group. Microsoft has consistently sought to keep up with AWS by matching prices for core computing and storage in Azure, and making its cloud services available from more places around the world alongside AWS.Earlier this year Alphabet's Google cloud — which had 5 percent of the cloud infrastructure market, according to Synergy — showed off Cloud Dataprep, an app for easily cleaning up data and getting it ready for deep analysis. Now Microsoft is responding with a data cleaning tool of its own that ""learns your data preparation steps as you perform them,"" a Microsoft spokesman wrote in an email."
396,2017-09-25T09:00:50-0400," Microsoft 365 for first-line workers includes Office 365, Windows 10, security and mobility tools and a new scheduling app. Microsoft is also highlighting upcoming third-party Windows 10 S commercial devices starting at $275. Microsoft on Monday introduced a software bundle for so-called front-line workers like cashiers, truck drivers and factory employees.The announcement at Microsoft's Ignite conference in Orlando, Florida, could help the company boost its usage and revenue numbers for some of its most important products at a time when it's dealing with competition from Google's Chrome OS and productivity apps like Google Docs.Called Microsoft 365 F1, the new offering includes StaffHub, a recently launched app for managing shifts so that employees don't need to call in or stop by the main office to check a weekly schedule printed on a piece of paper.It also comes with the Office 365, Windows 10 and Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility and Security suite, which companies use to manage and secure devices. Those products have been sold in other bundles in the past.But while Microsoft 365 F1 might seem like just the latest attempt to put a new package around existing software, Kirk Koenigsbauer, corporate vice president for Microsoft's Office 365 client applications, suggested it's more than the sum of its parts. ""Internally we're totally changing the way we work to really revolve around this idea of Microsoft 365 — the Windows, the Office and the Enterprise Mobility and Security teams are planning together, and we're laying out cadences in terms of when we plan to ship together,"" Koenigsbauer said. For one thing, he said, the group decided to integrate the administrative portals for Enterprise Mobility and Security and Office 365.To make StaffHub more appealing, Microsoft will also be enhancing the app in a few ways. Employees will be able to clock in and clock out from within the app, as well as view tasks that managers have assigned to them.The push for front-line workers also extends to hardware. Microsoft says Acer, HP, Fujitsu and Lenovo will be coming out with devices that would be well suited for front-line workers. They'll start at $275, making them considerably more affordable than Microsoft's own $999 Surface Laptop, and they'll be running Windows 10 S, the edition that meant to be more secure because it can run apps downloaded only from the Windows Store.In some cases, though, it might not make sense to equip every last front-line worker at a company with a new HP laptop running Windows 10. That's the case at Jackson Family Wines, whose wineries includes Kendall-Jackson. The company recently issued iPhones to its vineyard workers, who are using Office 365 services.""Their focus is to prune grapes, spray them, take care of them throughout the year and make sure they're producing the plentiful berries that they need for the wine and not working on a Windows 10 machine, if you will,"" said Doug Brown, Jackson Family Wines' director of IT operations.Managers and associates at the tasting rooms also need to coordinate and be informed of corporate announcements — and that communication happens in StaffHub. ""They're less interested in getting email,"" Brown said.Microsoft is also doubling down on the education market with a version of Microsoft 365 for education customers that comes with the Microsoft-owned game Minecraft, in addition to StaffHub."

So look at the software industry in the U.S. – in 50 years, there has been only four quarters – out of 200 quarters – of negative real spending on software in the U.S. So, if you're looking for a stable business that is the nature of that business,"" he said.""That's why some of the software companies where there's more of a recurring revenue stream is an attribute that we're looking for in this environment,"" he said, speaking from Goldman Sachs' global strategy conference.Government policy and Fed rate hiking policy are the biggest risks in the immediate term, Kostin said, but he said equity valuations look ""reasonably attractive.""He said software companies were ""shifting more and more of their business revenue mix towards recurring revenues – (so) that's an area to focus on,"" he said.A recurring revenue model is based on ongoing regular payments for a service or a product as opposed to one-time payment. More and more software companies are moving towards this model in order to ensure stability of profit streams.A number of software companies rely on revenue from recurring services like cloud subscriptions."
401,2017-10-12T14:59:16-0400," Steven Sinofsky was at Microsoft when the company went through its antitrust trials and the tech world hated it. He offers some advice for Facebook, which is facing unprecedented scrutiny. Former Microsoft exec Steven Sinofsky knows what Facebook is going through.He was at the giant when it was the undisputed leader of the tech industry, and when sentiment turned against the company and everybody — from federal regulators to competitors to the press — was attacking it.Now Facebook is going through a similar phase. A couple years ago, Mark Zuckerberg was viewed as a wonder-kid genius who had built a tech company worth hundreds of billions in less than a decade, and was making a well-studied turn into philanthropy.Then came the 2016 presidential election. Facebook users watched as their feeds were filled with polarizing political posts, including fake news and ads, including some that the company later admitted were bought by Russians in an attempt to influence the election.Now, the company is being forced to testify before various committees on Capitol Hill about the Russian ads, and Zuckerberg is getting raked over the coals for tone-deaf moves like showing flood-stricken Puerto Rico to demonstrate its virtual reality platform. All the while, commentators slam it for being too powerful and insufficiently apologetic, calling it one of the ""Four Horsemen"" or ""Frightful Five."" Sinofsky captures the disorienting feeling Facebook employees probably have right now, where they thought they were on top of the world and can't quite figure out why everybody suddenly seems to hate them.As he put it, ""We were just trying to make software. The more ppl said we were trying to be bad and do harm the wider the gap became. Surreal to us."" But he says this is a normal part of the growing-up process for companies, and he offered some recommendations on how Facebook could handle it using a framework called Tuckman's stages of group development.In the end, he's confident Facebook and other social networks will make it through the other side.

402,2018-11-27T01:00:00-0500,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google in May introduced a slick feature for Gmail that automatically completes sentences for users as they type. Tap out ""I love"" and Gmail might propose ""you"" or ""it.""But users are out of luck if the object of their affection is ""him"" or ""her.""Google's technology will not suggest gender-based pronouns because the risk is too high that its ""Smart Compose"" technology might predict someone's sex or gender identity incorrectly and offend users, product leaders revealed to Reuters in interviews.Gmail product manager Paul Lambert said a company research scientist discovered the problem in January when he typed ""I am meeting an investor next week,"" and Smart Compose suggested a possible follow-up question: ""Do you want to meet him?"" instead of ""her.""Consumers have become accustomed to embarrassing gaffes from autocorrect on smartphones. But Google refused to take chances at a time when gender issues are reshaping politics and society, and critics are scrutinizing potential biases in artificial intelligence like never before.""Not all 'screw ups' are equal,"" Lambert said. Gender is a ""a big, big thing"" to get wrong.Getting Smart Compose right could be good for business. Demonstrating that Google understands the nuances of AI better than competitors is part of the company's strategy to build affinity for its brand and attract customers to its AI-powered cloud computing tools, advertising services and hardware.Gmail has 1.5 billion users, and Lambert said Smart Compose assists on 11 percent of messages worldwide sent from Gmail.com, where the feature first launched.Smart Compose is an example of what AI developers call natural language generation (NLG), in which computers learn to write sentences by studying patterns and relationships between words in literature, emails and web pages.A system shown billions of human sentences becomes adept at completing common phrases but is limited by generalities. Men have long dominated fields such as finance and science, for example, so the technology would conclude from the data that an investor or engineer is ""he"" or ""him."" The issue trips up nearly every major tech company.Lambert said the Smart Compose team of about 15 engineers and designers tried several workarounds, but none proved bias-free or worthwhile. They decided the best solution was the strictest one: Limit coverage. The gendered pronoun ban affects fewer than 1 percent of cases where Smart Compose would propose something, Lambert said.""The only reliable technique we have is to be conservative,"" said Prabhakar Raghavan, who oversaw engineering of Gmail and other services until a recent promotion.NEW POLICYGoogle's decision to play it safe on gender follows some high-profile embarrassments for the company's predictive technologies.The company apologized in 2015 when the image recognition feature of its photo service labeled a black couple as gorillas. In 2016, Google altered its search engine's autocomplete function after it suggested the anti-Semitic query ""are jews evil"" when users sought information about Jews.Google has banned expletives and racial slurs from its predictive technologies, as well as mentions of its business rivals or tragic events.The company's new policy banning gendered pronouns also affected the list of possible responses in Google's Smart Reply. That service allow users to respond instantly to text messages and emails with short phrases such as ""sounds good.""Google uses tests developed by its AI ethics team to uncover new biases. A spam and abuse team pokes at systems, trying to find ""juicy"" gaffes by thinking as hackers or journalists might, Lambert said.Workers outside the United States look for local cultural issues. Smart Compose will soon work in four other languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French.""You need a lot of human oversight,"" said engineering leader Raghavan, because ""in each language, the net of inappropriateness has to cover something different.""WIDESPREAD CHALLENGEGoogle is not the only tech company wrestling with the gender-based pronoun problem.Agolo, a New York startup that has received investment from Thomson Reuters, uses AI to summarize business documents.Its technology cannot reliably determine in some documents which pronoun goes with which name. So the summary pulls several sentences to give users more context, said Mohamed AlTantawy, Agolo's chief technology officer.He said longer copy is better than missing details. ""The smallest mistakes will make people lose confidence,"" AlTantawy said. ""People want 100 percent correct.""Yet, imperfections remain. Predictive keyboard tools developed by Google and Apple Inc propose the gendered ""policeman"" to complete ""police"" and ""salesman"" for ""sales.""Type the neutral Turkish phrase ""one is a soldier"" into Google Translate and it spits out ""he's a soldier"" in English. So do translation tools from Alibaba and Microsoft Corp . Amazon.com Inc opts for ""she"" for the same phrase on its translation service for cloud computing customers.AI experts have called on the companies to display a disclaimer and multiple possible translations.Microsoft's LinkedIn said it avoids gendered pronouns in its year-old predictive messaging tool, Smart Replies, to ward off potential blunders.Alibaba and Amazon did not respond to requests to comment.Warnings and limitations like those in Smart Compose remain the most-used countermeasures in complex systems, said John Hegele, integration engineer at Durham, North Carolina-based Automated Insights Inc, which generates news articles from statistics.""The end goal is a fully machine-generated system where it magically knows what to write,"" Hegele said.

This wiped out the hedge fund's stake in both companies, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings released Tuesday revealed.It's important to note that the fund's holdings in Apple were relatively small, worth just $291,278 at Tuesday's market close. However the Snap holding is significant. The 1.55 million shares were worth $19.48 million at Tuesday's close. There is a lot of bearishness around Snap, which has continued to miss earnings expectations and failed to grow its user base significantly. Snap shares are down over 48 percent since it went public in March. Wall Street analysts are also not sold on Snap. The stock has 19 ""hold"" ratings, nine ""sell,"" and one ""strong sell,"" according to Reuters data. Soros Fund Management also reduced its stake in Twitter by 5,700 shares. It still holds 18,400 shares of the social media site.Facebook also fell out of favor with Soros. The investor dumped 367,262 shares of the social networking giant in the last quarter. Soros Fund Management still owns 109,451 Facebook shares.But not all names in the technology sector were sold off. Soros upped his stake in Microsoft by 99,000 shares and Amazon by 2,500 shares.The SEC filings only show the change in share ownership of Soros' fund, but no commentary as to his fund's thinking behind the trades.Major technology stocks have been on a tear this year, although some of the newly-listed names such as Snap have struggled. Apple, which Soros' hedge fund also sold all its shares in, is up nearly 48 percent year-to-date. Analysts are excited at the potential of the new iPhone X, released earlier this month. Apple shares hit a record high last week.Soros' position contrasts to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which topped up on Apple shares in the last quarter. Buffett's conglomerate increased its holdings of the iPhone maker's stock by 3.9 million to 134.1 million, a SEC filing released Tuesday showed."

All contracts are signed multiple times. They go from ship to ship, port to port, through quite a journey.""Distributed ledgers are groupings of data shared across multiple locations without the need for central administrators and other middle men.The original blockchain was built to serve as the distributed ledger for bitcoin transactions. But various blockchain experts believe the technology can provide transparency for a multitude of different industries, not just the financial services.""We're not talking about a new currency here, we're not talking about money. We're talking about data aggregation,"" EY's Crawford added.Maersk said the blockchain platform would enable the shipping giant to maintain a smoother relationship with the insurance market.""It is a priority for us to leverage technology to streamline and automate our interaction with the insurance market,"" Lars Henneberg, head of risk and insurance at Maersk said in a statement Wednesday.""Insurance transactions are currently far too tedious and frictional. The distance between risk and capital is simply too far. Blockchain technology has the potential to facilitate the desired development that is long overdue.""Marine insurance has traditionally relied on physical contracts being shipped to and fro, from one port to another, in order to be eventually signed, according to EY.The global research firm has worked closely with software security company Guardtime to develop the blockchain platform.Guardtime said it expects to roll out blockchain to the wider insurance industry after its initial marine insurance deployment.""Initially, we focused on marine insurance as it is well-suited to a blockchain solution as it has a complex international ecosystem, with multiple parties, multiple jurisdictions, high transaction volumes and significant levels of reconciliation,"" Guardtime CEO Mike Gault told CNBC in an emailed note prior to the announcement.""But down the line we expect it to be rolled out across other areas of insurance markets — as there are clearly shared benefits and attributes. In fact, blockchain can be applied to any commercial or specialty line of business with high-value assets.""The blockchain solution was built on Microsoft's cloud platform, Microsoft Azure.Cloud technology allows firms to store data and software via the internet rather than locally on a hard drive.A proof of concept for EY's digital ledger was completed in March.""When we built the proof of concept, we built a prototype on Azure to make sure the whole thing worked and is secure, and now what we're doing is building it,"" EY's Crawford noted.""We provide that cloud service which we believe is one of the strongest ones on the market, and that's why we chose Microsoft to work with.""Guardtime said Microsoft's cloud offered a secure network on which to build the blockchain.""For any new system to be implemented it needs to be built using the right model, one that is robust, scalable and can co-exist with existing IT infrastructure or systems,"" Guardtime's Gault said.""That's what Azure and the cloud technology enables us to do, without comprising performance or flexibility, which is why it was so important to partner with Microsoft.""Mark Russinovish, chief technology officer at Microsoft Azure, said that blockchain had the potential to be ""transformational.""""Microsoft believes blockchain is a transformational technology with the ability to significantly reduce the friction of doing business, especially streamlining business processes shared across multiple organizations,"" he said.He added: ""Marine insurance is a prime example of a complex business process that can be optimized with blockchain.""Insurers MS Amlin and XL Catlin also collaborated with EY on the project, as well as insurance industry body ACORD (Association for Cooperative Operations Research and Development).The blockchain solution is set to be implemented from January 2018 onwards.The race to create large distributed ledger network has become increasingly competitive.IBM for instance announced it would partner with food giants like Nestle and Unilever in August, and use blockchain technology to trace the movements of food to avoid tackle contamination faster.EY told CNBC that its decision to make the announcement ahead of time was due to a host of other players making similar moves."

408,2019-01-11T01:09:06-0500,"Europe's public cloud market is expected to grow 22 percent annually until 2022.Revenues in Europe are growing faster than in any other region for some U.S. cloud giants like Salesforce.GDPR has gone from an ""obstacle"" to an ""accelerator"" for cloud adoption in Europe, according to some experts.Over the past year, Europe's tech sector has been overshadowed by privacy scandals, stricter regulation and the trade war between the U.S. and China.But there's one bright spot where the outlook isn't quite so bleak: cloud computing.Europe's public cloud market is expected to grow at a 22 percent rate for the next three years, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC). The trend is showing up in earnings reports of U.S. companies from small cloud firms to enterprise software giants.Salesforce, for example, reported 31 percent revenue growth in its European business last quarter.""We were the fastest growing region in the world, even though some of them are smaller, so we're obviously very excited about that,"" Chris Ciauri, Executive Vice President of Salesforce EMEA, told CNBC in a phone interview in December.Cloud computing allows businesses and consumers to store and access data, apps and software over the internet, instead of locally on a hard drive or server. Global investment in cloud services has surged in recent years as more companies have adopted online infrastructure offered by tech giants like Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Research firm Gartner estimates worldwide public cloud revenue will top $278 billion in 2021, up from $145 billion in 2017.There is a common assumption that European organizations are 18 to 24 months behind the U.S. when it comes to cloud adoption, according to a report published in 2018 by IDC senior program director of European software Carla Arend. Arend said the issue is less about European companies lagging behind and more about a cautious, pragmatic attitude toward new technology that is culturally different than in other regions.""European organizations, they are quite allergic to hype,"" she said in a phone interview with CNBC last week. ""Only when they really see the tangible benefits, will they embrace the technology.""Arend said that, after taking the time to evaluate the benefits and challenges of moving operations off-premises and into the cloud, European organizations are now getting into the market fast.Salesforce's Ciauri pointed to clients that range from Aston Martin to Eurostar to Spanish bank BBVA that have recently embraced cloud solutions.Another reason U.S. firms are benefiting from cloud adoption in Europe is a lack of alternatives.""There are no European megacloud providers,"" said Lauren Nelson, a principal analyst at research firm Forrester, in an email to CNBC. ""This means using a U.S.-headquartered company or a smaller player.""U.S. cloud players are filling the void with expansion plans across Europe. In December, Amazon's AWS opened new data centers in Sweden, and the company says it already serves ""tens of thousands"" of customers in the Nordics. Microsoft announced plans last year to build data centers in Norway, Germany and Switzerland.Chinese firms are also competing for the European market. Tech titan Alibaba expanded its presence in Europe in October with new data centers in the U.K.The massive data privacy legislation called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that went into effect across the EU in May could have been a deterrent to more companies moving data online. The law requires firms to provide customers with data they request and grants consumers the ""right to be forgotten,"" meaning their data can be erased.IDC's Arend said that instead of rejecting internet solutions that put more data online, European firms have turned to the cloud to help comply with the new laws. She said GDPR has gone from being an ""obstacle"" to an ""accelerator"" for cloud adoption in Europe.Still many firms are reluctant to store all of their data with one company. This has benefited big cloud providers, as well as smaller firms.""Of all the regions in the world, Europe is the one that's really humming for us,"" Brian Halligan, CEO of cloud marketing and sales firm HubSpot, told CNBC at the Slush tech conference in Helsinki in December. HubSpot is a Cambridge, Massachusetts based-firm valued around $5 billion that tailors its software for small and medium-sized businesses.HubSpot launched in Dublin in 2012 has since established an office in Berlin. Halligan said the company will also open a Paris location in the first quarter of this year.""People have talked about the European economy slowing down,"" Halligan said. ""We haven't seen any sign of that."""

410,2017-08-31T15:12:48-0400," The integrations make it easier to connect Microsoft's Team Foundation Server and Visual Studio Team Services applications with AWS' CloudFormation, CodeDeploy, Elastic Beanstalk,  Lambda and S3 services. The Microsoft programs have primarily advertised their ability to deploy applications on Microsoft's own Azure public cloud. Amazon and Microsoft, two archrivals in cloud computing and stiff competitors for Seattle-area tech talent, are cooperating a lot more.Earlier this week, we saw the marriage of Amazon's Alexa virtual assistant and Microsoft's Cortana.Now, the companies are teaming up so programmers can more easily take code they manage in Microsoft's tools, and roll it out on Amazon's cloud. On Thursday Microsoft published a blog post detailing the ways in which its Team Foundation Server on-premises software and its Visual Studio Team Services cloud service can hook into various Amazon Web Services tools.After installing the new tools, developers can upload content to AWS' widely used S3 storage service, automate the deployments with AWS' CodeDeploy tool and run apps with the Lambda serverless-computing service, among other things, without leaving the confines of the Microsoft productsTo build the integrations, Amazon engineers collaborated with members of Microsoft's Visual Studio ALM Rangers group, Microsoft program manager Joseph Bourne wrote in the blog post. The ALM Rangers group is tasked with coming up with ""out of band solutions for missing features or guidance,"" Microsoft has said.Effectively, Microsoft is providing a new source of revenue for AWS, the biggest cloud around and the main competitor to Microsoft's own Azure cloud. That's notable because historically Microsoft has advertised the ability for people to use its source code management programs with Azure.But if Microsoft is serious about making things as simple as possible for end users, then the move makes sense. The openness lines up with Microsoft's recent willingness under CEO Satya Nadella to work with non-Microsoft platforms. For example, Microsoft has made it possible for people to use Linux in its Windows 10 operating system.At the end of July, Amazon held 34 percent of the cloud infrastructure services market, while Microsoft had 11 percent, according to Synergy Research."
411,2017-11-03T15:27:18-0400," Uber's artificial intelligence research lab now has around 30 people after being established less than a year ago. The group's new Pyro open-source software is being used to predict ride supply and demand and make financial models.  Uber isn't about to be left behind in the race for artificial intelligence.The ride-hailing service has been staffing up in AI over the past year, thanks in large part to its December 2016 acquisition of Geometric Intelligence, a start-up incubated at New York University. The idea is to help the company do everything smarter — rides, food delivery, self-driving cars — as it faces competition from the likes of Alphabet, Amazon and Lyft.Rather than letting the start-up continue to function in New York, Uber brought the team to its San Francisco headquarters in March 2017. And while CEO Gary Marcus did leave just a few months after joining, Uber was quick to promote another cofounder, Zoubin Ghahramani, to be the new chief of the burgeoning lab. The lab has roughly doubled since then, with nearly 30 people out of Uber's more than 16,000 employees, Ghahramani told CNBC in an interview. And he's structured the team to avoid some of the historical issues that other big tech companies have faced in operating research organizations.""Having interacted with many companies over the years as an academic, I've seen companies where research was sort of like this side thing — there was always this frustration that it wasn't interacting with the core business,"" said Ghahramani, who has advised Microsoft Research and has received funding from Alphabet. To try to avoid this sidelining, the Uber lab has two main programs: core and connections.Core is about advancing basic AI research, which is a function of many corporate AI groups.  Connections, meanwhile, is about working with all different parts of Uber. For example, the lab needs to help figure out the best way to run Uber's main ride service in different cities — but it must also provide insight into the time required to prepare and deliver food in the Uber Eats business, automate some of the work of Uber's customer support department, and even contribute to the work of Uber's self-driving car group, Ghahramani said. ""Ironically, I've spent my whole academic career engaging with academics, publishing papers and spending my time in universities, and so on,"" he said. ""What really excites me is the possibility of having an amazing material impact on our future world in a positive way. And so that's going to happen through the connections, the business of Uber.""At the same time, Uber's AI researchers are still centralized. They are not embedding themselves inside other groups at the company, as is the case at places like Pinterest. (The lab falls under Uber's advanced programs department, whose mandate is to work on future products.)To help with recruiting, Uber is publishing research for anyone to read and build on. And on Friday the group took another step forward by releasing its software for free under an open-source license for the first time.Uber is using the software, which goes by the name Pyro, to try to predict supply and demand for rides a few hours ahead of time. Pyro works on top of PyTorch, an AI framework that Facebook open-sourced earlier this year. The researchers are also bringing Pyro to Uber's finance department to build forecasts of the next few weeks and months of Uber's business. The fact that Uber's business is fundamentally based in the physical world, rather than being purely about software or the internet, also helps the company recruit.""The fact that we are so in the physical world, so in real time, so engaged with things like moving about and self driving and things like that that the actual artificial intelligence, cognitive science and machine learning problems are really pretty challenging and pretty different than a company that only interacts with people through a browser or something like that,"" Ghahramani said.""The physical world is pretty complicated, and it makes you really stretch the stuff that you do."""

413,2018-11-29T21:29:00-0500,"(Corrects spelling of name in 16th paragraph)* Biggest battle has swung from ride-hailing to financial services* Deals bolster Grab's position in Go-Jek's home turf of Indonesia* Both now have big networks of human agents to introduce servicesJAKARTA, Nov 30 (Reuters) - At a makeshift kiosk outside her home in a South Jakarta backstreet, 39-year-old Julaiha stands at the front lines of a multi-billion-dollar battle over one of the richest opportunities in the global digital economy.Along with goods such as instant noodles and cigarettes, she sells insurance and offers a service to pay utility bills. Though Julaiha has never had a bank account, she can help customers apply for small loans or order products from the internet.Julaiha, who uses only one name, last year eagerly became an agent for Singapore-based Grab, a company known as the Uber of Southeast Asia for its ride-hailing service. Her husband, a motorcycle-taxi driver, also works for Grab.""I used to have work hard in a shop,"" Julaiha said. ""Now I work at home, press the phone, and earn money.""Their recruitment is part of Grab's efforts to muscle in on Indonesia - the home of rival Go-Jek - as the firms vie to bring banking, e-commerce, ride-hailing, food-delivery and other services to every corner of Southeast Asia.The goal is to become the indispensable ""super-app"" for countries with a collective population of over 650 million, with the most fiercely contested front now shifting away from their roots in ride-hailing to financial services.""The majority of people in Southeast Asia don't have bank accounts,"" said Jixun Foo, managing partner for GGV Ventures and an early Grab backer. ""It's a massive opportunity.""The land-grab has attracted billions in funding from marquee names.Backers for Grab include SoftBank Group Corp, Microsoft Corp, Toyota Motor Corp and Uber , whose Southeast Asia business it acquired in March. Go-Jek's corner features Google, Tencent Holdings , JD.com Inc and KKR &amp; Co. (For a graphic on investments in ride-hailing firms click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/2OghNFf)The firms' similarities are striking. Both were founded a year apart as ride service companies: Grab as a taxi-booking app in Malaysia while Go-Jek organised an informal sector of motorcycle taxis - a key way to get around Jakarta, a mega-city with no metro system and epic traffic jams.With cut-rate prices that made their services accessible in low-income countries, they quickly gained millions of users. Both are even led by friends - Go-Jek CEO Nadiem Makarim went to Harvard Business School alongside Grab co-founders Anthony Tan and Tan Hooi Ling.Grab is the bigger regional player, valued at around $11 billion at its last funding round in August, sources with knowledge of the matter have said. Separate sources put Go-Jek's valuation between $9 billion and $10 billion. Each firm is conducting a new funding round, the sources said.The firms have declined to publicly disclose funding and valuation details.TWO DEALS PAVE GRAB'S WAYIndonesia accounts for more than a third of Southeast Asia's population and Grab, declaring the market a priority, has been aggressive - acquiring startup Kudo and its network of 1.7 million agents that now includes Julaiha.It has also partnered with fintech firm OVO, owned by Indonesian conglomerate Lippo Group, whose vast mall holdings have helped make OVO's smartphone payment system a ubiquitous presence at shopping centers and restaurant chains.With OVO's help, Grab intends to bring a ""full range of financial services, including micro lending, insurance, and savings to Indonesia,"" said Grab Financial Managing Director Reuben Lai.Grab has also taken an equity stake in OVO, according to a source with direct knowledge of the matter, declining to be identified as the stake has yet to be publicly announced. The companies declined to comment on investment details.The Kudo and OVO deals have thrust Grab into a position to seize Indonesian market share away from Go-Jek, although the incumbent domestic super-app is currently viewed by analysts as having a significant edge.Go-Jek boasts 108 million app downloads to date and 50 percent of Go-Jek users use its payments service Go-Pay, which it says is the country's most popular e-wallet.OVO has in contrast 60 million downloads, but claims to be Indonesia's leading platform by total payments volume due to the higher amounts paid by wealthier customers at restaurant chains where it is used.A HUMAN EDGEOthers seeking to cash in on Southeast Asia's new digital economy include China's Alibaba, which is making its push in financial services through its Ant Financial affiliate and controls e-commerce site Lazada. Tencent is promoting its WeChat super-app and is also active in e-commerce and gaming.The region is big enough for many players to have their share. But Go-Jek and Grab are expected to be hard to beat with the familiarity and trust built up by their ride-hailing services and perhaps surprisingly in a digital age, their human agents.The agents can introduce those with no banking experience - estimated at roughly two-thirds of Indonesia's population - to financial services while also acting as centres for customers to order and pick up their e-commerce purchases.Like Grab, Go-Jek is a fan of husband and wife teams that split the driver and agent roles, and following Grab's lead, it moved to expand is agent network last year with the purchase of startup Mapan. The network consists of 180,000 community leaders who run informal groups that help working class families buy household appliances and whose clients number 2 million.""Housewives told us they had no option for credit and couldn't afford most things,"" said Aldi Haryopratomo, Mapan's founder and now CEO of Go-Jek's Go-Pay unit.Outside Indonesia, Grab has the upper hand. The region's biggest ride-hailing firm serving eight markets, it started on the ""super-app"" path only last year but quickly built a range of services.Grab offers smartphone payment ""wallets"" in partnership with banks or fintech firms in Singapore, Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, and has with one in the works in Thailand. Kudo is also expanding to the Philippines, Vietnam, and Singapore.Go-Jek too is starting to foray into Grab's turf. While it does not have same number of partnerships, it this month announced a tie-up with DBS Group Holdings, Southeast Asia's largest lender, for financial services. It debuted its app in Vietnam in September and in Singapore this week.(Reporting by Cindy Silviana and Fanny Potkin in Jakarta; Additional reporting by Mai Nguyen in Hanoi and Jessica Damiana in Jakarta; Writing by Fanny Potkin; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Edwina Gibbs)"

Microsoft on Tuesday announced that it has acquired Cycle Computing, a 12-year-old company that specializes in running complex high-performance computing workloads across different public clouds. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.The move could help Microsoft ensure that more of the supercomputing jobs companies want to do end up on its Azure public cloud, rather than other public clouds, such as the market-leading Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform. Currently Cycle Computing's CycleCloud Software helps companies run certain computing jobs on multiple clouds, and then provision more or less infrastructure as necessary.""We will continue to support Cycle Computing clients using AWS and/or Google Cloud,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in an email.

416,2017-08-11T03:04:52-0400," India is a hot-bed for research and development for tech companies because of its young, middle class population Microsoft Research India works on projects in areas of machine learning, natural language processing and it explores creating technology for emerging markets One of the projects, 99DOTS, has looked at low-cost ways to ensure tuberculosis patients regularly take their medication From hacking agriculture to developing inexpensive tools for tuberculosis patients, Microsoft researchers in India are trying to solve myriad social problems in the subcontinent.India is a research and development hot-bed for large tech companies like Microsoft for several reasons: It has an increasingly middle-class young population and it has significant challenges present in society that can be solved using advanced technology.U.S. market research firm Forrester said in a report earlier this year that India's rising levels of education, abundance of technical talent, open and growing economy and rising mobile penetration will also contribute to digital proliferation. The firm predicted that, by 2020, India will have about 690 million internet users. That implies that there's going to always be a market for new tech products or services that address specific issues in society. So, for companies like Microsoft, there is a big potential customer base.In fact, the number of research and development centers being set up by large multinational companies in India is rising, according to a report widely cited by Indian media.Microsoft Research India investigates machine learning, natural language processing, algorithms, cryptography and data sciences for the tech giant. It also explores creating technology for emerging markets. The organization works extensively with the Indian and international scientific community, academia and other Microsoft Research Labs in places like the U.K., China and the U.S.""One of the things that we're trying to do in an organization like Microsoft Research is to predict and invent the future,"" Sriram Rajamani, managing director of Microsoft Research India, told CNBC.Rajamani oversees a team of about 55 full-time staff, 30 research fellows who are usually fresh graduates and approximately 100 interns throughout the year.Current projects from the research lab include Melange, which is trying to study multilingual speech that can help to humanize virtual assistants in the future, and make them more accessible to the developing world.Another project — Harnessing AutoMobiles for Safety (HAMS) — uses sensors like a smartphone's front-camera, a phone's GPS and a vehicle's on-board diagnostics scanner to detect and alert if a driver is distracted or sleepy while driving.Most of the projects are rolled out in small pilots, sometimes in cooperation with state governments in India. The successful ones then go on to scale up. Sometimes they are also brought to other markets.One of the more prominent programs is 99DOTS, a four-year-old project that makes special envelopes for health-care providers to use for tuberculosis medication. After the patient takes the daily dose of medicine, a unique, toll-free phone number is revealed. With each daily call, the patient's doctors can monitor if they missed a dose in real-time and send reminders and other incentives.Bill Thies and Andrew Cross, who were the two main researchers working on 99DOTS, have formed a separate company called Everwell Health Solutions. There's now a licensing agreement with Microsoft Research and the company is employing people to scale 99DOTS throughout the country, according to Rajamani. He added that, if it works, there are plans to bring the concept abroad.Microsoft also rolled out a skills development initiative in India called Project Sangam. It is a cloud-based platform that integrates with LinkedIn, where users complete online courses for new skills and are then matched with relevant job vacancies. Part of the idea behind Project Sangam came from the Massively Empowered Classrooms project that was experimenting with how technology can improve the quality of higher education in India, according to Rajamani.Another Microsoft team in India, he explained, was also thinking about how to skill and train blue collar labor in the country, and so Project Sangam was created.Having research and development centers in India also allows companies to localize their existing products to fit the target demographic. For tech companies, those are people who are newly acquainted with technology and are connecting to the internet for the first time. Analysts have argued that localization of products and services in emerging markets like India is key to success for multinationals. Ashutosh Sharma, a research director and vice president at Forrester, told CNBC that, when it comes to the Indian market, there are some similarities to the West on the surface: an English-speaking, younger demographic with growing disposable income.But beyond that, it's a lot more complicated. ""When you scratch the surface, there's a lot of issues with respect to the digital population in India,"" he said. ""First of all, the awareness level beyond using their mobile phones for (social media) is non-existent.""Sharma also pointed out that language is an issue in a country with more than a dozen main languages and hundreds of dialects. In fact, beyond the major cities, few people interact in English. Moreover, the disposable income in India's smaller cities and rural areas is low.""So people are very careful about the way they spend money. There's not that much money to go around with respect to the income level,"" said Sharma.But the Indian government has expressed well-documented interest in promoting digital literacy and technological advancements throughout the country. On a national level, that includes Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Digital India"" campaign to improve online infrastructure and services, the rolling out of a national identification system, and the newly passed goods and services legislation that requires businesses to file their tax returns online.Microsoft's Rajamani said the government's willingness to make India more digital provides researchers the opportunity to work on new projects that can have a high impact on society. He explained that researchers choose projects they are interested in exploring and senior managers do not dictate any specific focus areas. Still, most of the existing projects fall under categories like artificial intelligence, mobile and cloud computing — areas that are crucial to Microsoft's global business strategies.""The interesting thing to understand is that research is a social process. Most of the research teams (at Microsoft Research India), they have decided to form together on their own,"" Rajamani said. ""I don't tell them to do this together, but they cannot do it alone.""Researchers do not choose projects on a whim, according to Rajamani, as they need to be able to convince their colleagues to collaborate on their ideas. Still, since the researchers are paid employees of Microsoft, the availability of funding and resources is not an issue — something that academic research can't say."

Microsoft just named artificial intelligence as one of its top priorities in a financial filing.The annual report for the company's 2017 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, now includes six references to AI, up from zero in the previous annual report.And the company has plunked AI into its corporate vision statement, too.""Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best-in-class platforms and productivity services for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with AI,"" the company wrote in the annual report, which was released on Wednesday.For the sake of comparison, here's last year's version: ""Our strategic vision is to compete and grow as a productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world.""For Microsoft watchers, that old tagline should sound very familiar -- pretty much ever since he became CEO of Microsoft in 2014, Satya Nadella has repeatedly spoken of the ""mobile-first and cloud-first world"" that the company was trying to target. Mobile is gone -- not a surprise, given the company's struggles with its Windows Phone operating system and its acquisition of Nokia, which Microsoft essentially declared worthless when it wrote down the total value of that acquisition in 2015.Cloud computing, including fast-growing products like Office 365 and the Azure public cloud are still there. Now AI is there with it, too.Microsoft has acquired a few AI startups, like Maluuba and Swiftkey, since Nadella took over, and has established a formal AI and Research group. That team ""focuses on our AI development and other forward-looking research and development efforts spanning infrastructure, services, applications, and search,"" the annual report says.Microsoft's vision reset comes after Sundar Pichai, CEO of Alphabet's Google, began saying that the world is shifting from being mobile-first to AI-first.

420,2019-01-07T17:21:12-0500,"Amazon closed out the Monday trading day as the world's most valuable public company, surpassing Microsoft.Amazon reached a $1 trillion market cap in September but is now worth less than $800 billion.The company has a number of growth drivers that excite investors.Now it's Amazon's turn at the top.The 24-year-old company surpassed Microsoft as the world's most valuable public company on Monday, closing the trading day with a market value of $796.8 billion. Microsoft, which just passed Apple to take over the top spot a little over a month ago, is worth $783.4 billion.It's been a bumpy ride up the charts. Amazon's market capitalization topped $1 trillion in September, but a late-year stock market collapse resulted in the worst quarter for the shares since the 2008 recession. Nevertheless, after rallying in three of the first four trading days of 2019, Amazon is No. 1. There are a number of reasons why investors remain bullish on the stock, but it mostly comes down to avenues for expansion.""Despite its current massive size, we see Amazon's opportunities as mostly unconstrained based on a successful track record of capitalizing on consumer and IT department spending,"" Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. He initiated coverage with a ""buy"" rating and a target price of $1,920, which represents an 18 percent increase from the current price.Amazon rose 3.4 percent on Monday to $1,629.51, and the stock is up 8.5 percent in 2019.Here are five topics that are exciting Amazon investors:While Microsoft's cloud is growing at a faster clip, Amazon Web Sservices remains the industry juggernaut.Annual revenue now exceeds $23 billion and AWS controls 40 percent of the public cloud market, according to Synergy Research Group.With millions of active customers, AWS has more than 140 services for developers, and the business continues to expand geographically. Amazon cloud facilities are coming to Bahrain, Hong Kong, Italy and South Africa, and the company is vying to win a $10 billion U.S. Defense of Department contract.AWS is also signing more big corporate customers, locking them into longer-term contracts. AWS started disclosing ""performance obligations"" this year, which it defines as future revenue ""associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized."" In its most recent quarter, that amount grew to $17.8 billion, up from $16 billion in the second quarter and $12.4 billion in the period before that.Amazon has expanded into a lot of different businesses over the years, but its core is still e-commerce.Amazon accounted for roughly half of all e-commerce sales in the U.S. last year, according to eMarketer, and roughly 90 percent of Amazon's revenue comes from retail sales.Within Amazon's retail business, its third-party marketplace is becoming more important than ever. The marketplace accounted for 31.3 percent of all U.S. online sales last year, eMarketer estimates, up 35.6 percent from the previous year.There's room to grow. Amazon owns just 5 percent all of U.S. retail sales (including online and offline), according to eMarketer. The company has been heavily investing in other regions, like India, and is even trying to capture more brick-and-mortar sales through its acquisition of Whole Foods.Amazon has several compelling opportunities for additional revenue growth. Advertising has broken through as an area to watch. It's part of Amazon's ""Other"" business segment, which grew 122 percent in the third quarter, crossing the $2.5 billion mark. More advertisers are allocating part of their budget to Amazon.Health care is another big focus for Amazon, after last year's purchase of online pharmacy PillPack for about $1 billion. Banking is an area where Amazon could do more, and last year the company was reportedly working on a product that could resemble a checking account. It already offers a number of financial products.Amazon has also been ramping up in Hollywood, with Amazon Studios, to produce original television shows and movies that Prime subscribers can watch. The Studios group has done deals with Nicole Kidman, Jordan Peele and producer Cheo Hodari Coker.The company doesn't necessarily generate revenue every time someone says ""Hey Alexa,"" but Amazon can make money through Alexa usage when people use the assistant to buy products. The service recently integrated with Microsoft Cortana.One of the key differences between Amazon and other tech giants is its tight-knit leadership team. CEO Jeff Bezos has put together a fiercely loyal group of executives at the top of the company, with many of them having stayed at Amazon for years, if not decades.Bezos' S-Team, which reportedly contains fewer than 20 executives, is known for its stability, a part of Amazon's culture that the CEO once highlighted during an internal staff meeting.""I'm very happy that we don't have a lot of turnover on the S-team,"" Bezos said, as CNBC previously reported. ""I don't intend to change that — I like you guys a lot.""Amazon has bumped into several contentious issues lately, including attacks from President Trump and the company's handling of the search for a second headquarters.But none of those issues pose as an immediate risk to Amazon, analysts say. Contrast that with Apple's struggles in China and Facebook's privacy scandals, and Amazon's stock is seen by many as less risky.""Amazon does not have the company-specific issues that many of the rest of the companies have,"" Loop Capital's Anthony Chukumba told CNBC.WATCH: Investor Bill Miller says Amazon will double in the next three years"

The issue trips up nearly every major tech company.Lambert said the Smart Compose team of about 15 engineers and designers tried several workarounds, but none proved bias-free or worthwhile. They decided the best solution was the strictest one: Limit coverage. The gendered pronoun ban affects fewer than 1 percent of cases where Smart Compose would propose something, Lambert said.""The only reliable technique we have is to be conservative,"" said Prabhakar Raghavan, who oversaw engineering of Gmail and other services until a recent promotion.Google's decision to play it safe on gender follows some high-profile embarrassments for the company's predictive technologies.The company apologized in 2015 when the image recognition feature of its photo service labeled a black couple as gorillas. In 2016, Google altered its search engine's autocomplete function after it suggested the anti-Semitic query ""are jews evil"" when users sought information about Jews.Google has banned expletives and racial slurs from its predictive technologies, as well as mentions of its business rivals or tragic events.The company's new policy banning gendered pronouns also affected the list of possible responses in Google's Smart Reply. That service allow users to respond instantly to text messages and emails with short phrases such as ""sounds good.""Google uses tests developed by its AI ethics team to uncover new biases. A spam and abuse team pokes at systems, trying to find ""juicy"" gaffes by thinking as hackers or journalists might, Lambert said.Workers outside the United States look for local cultural issues. Smart Compose will soon work in four other languages: Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and French.""You need a lot of human oversight,"" said engineering leader Raghavan, because ""in each language, the net of inappropriateness has to cover something different.""Google is not the only tech company wrestling with the gender-based pronoun problem.Agolo, a New York startup that has received investment from Thomson Reuters, uses AI to summarize business documents. Its technology cannot reliably determine in some documents which pronoun goes with which name. So the summary pulls several sentences to give users more context, said Mohamed AlTantawy, Agolo's chief technology officer.He said longer copy is better than missing details. ""The smallest mistakes will make people lose confidence,"" AlTantawy said. ""People want 100 percent correct.""Yet, imperfections remain. Predictive keyboard tools developed by Google and Apple Inc propose the gendered ""policeman"" to complete ""police"" and ""salesman"" for ""sales.""Type the neutral Turkish phrase ""one is a soldier"" into Google Translate and it spits out ""he's a soldier"" in English. So do translation tools from Alibaba and Microsoft Corp. Amazon.com Inc opts for ""she"" for the same phrase on its translation service for cloud computing customers.AI experts have called on the companies to display a disclaimer and multiple possible translations.Microsoft's LinkedIn said it avoids gendered pronouns in its year-old predictive messaging tool, Smart Replies, to ward off potential blunders. Alibaba and Amazon did not respond to requests to comment. Warnings and limitations like those in Smart Compose remain the most-used countermeasures in complex systems, said John Hegele, integration engineer at Durham, North Carolina-based Automated Insights Inc, which generates news articles from statistics.""The end goal is a fully machine-generated system where it magically knows what to write,"" Hegele said. ""There's been a ton of advances made but we're not there yet."""
424,2017-07-26T09:12:21-0400,"When Microsoft unveiled the first Surface tablet five years ago, it was a spectacular failure.At the time, the Apple iPhone was well on its way to conquering the technology industry, and the iPad appeared set to lead an even more devastating invasion of Microsoft's office-worker kingdom. Microsoft conceived of Surface, an innovative laptop-tablet hybrid, as a way to show off the versatility of its software. Windows machines, it argued, could work as phones, personal computers and tablets. And didn't everyone love Windows?Nope.  Microsoft soon took a $900 million write-off for unsold Surfaces. Another effort to break into the hardware business, its acquisition of the limping phone-maker Nokia, dug a deeper river of red ink —  a $7.6 billion write-off. By the summer of 2015, Microsoft's hardware dreams looked crushed. Even today, the Xbox One, Microsoft's latest gaming console,  is losing to the  Sony  PlayStation 4.Still, Microsoft persisted — and today, the company is making the most visionary computers in the industry, if not the best machines, period. In the last two years, while Apple has focused mainly on mobile devices, Microsoft has put out a series of computers that reimagine the future of PCs in thrilling ways.Yes, Apple loyalists, that's just my subjective view. And yes, Microsoft's latest financial results aren't exactly on my side here — the company announced last week that though its  cloud software business is growing rapidly, revenue for its Surface division  declined by 2 percent over the last year (because of changes it made in its launch schedule).Microsoft, of course, makes most of its money from the PC business by licensing Windows to other computer makers, and it says that part of its goal in building hardware is to inspire and guide those companies' designs. But it also wants the Surface line to sell — and although the division has grown enormously in the last few years, becoming a critical part of Microsoft's overall business, Surface is still  far smaller than Apple's Mac or iPad line.Yet perhaps because it's way behind Apple, Microsoft's hardware division is creating products more daring than much of what has been coming out of its rival lately.The hybrid Surface Pro — the inheritor of that first Surface's vision, the latest version of which was released in May — hasn't just become a moneymaker for the company. It was also the clear inspiration for the Apple iPad Pro, which supports a pen and keyboard but still feels less like a full-fledged laptop than Surface does.More from the New York Times:Women in Start-Up World Speak Up About Harassment A Backlash Builds Against Sexual Harassment in Silicon Valley Women in Tech Speak Frankly on Culture of HarassmentLate last year, Microsoft also unveiled Surface Studio, a big-screen desktop that bears a passing resemblance to the Apple iMac — except its vertical display effortlessly pivots into a kind of digital drafting table, a slick trick that you can imagine Steve Jobs having lots of fun showing off at a keynote address.And in the spring, Microsoft showed off Surface Laptop, which sounds humdrum enough; in shape and purpose, it isn't much different from the MacBook Air, Apple's pioneering thin and light laptop. But Microsoft's machine has a better screen than the Air, and, more important, a future. People loved the Air, but Apple doesn't appear to want to upgrade it, so Microsoft stepped in to perfect Apple's baby.Note, too, that the rest of Apple's PC road map has lately been looking shaky. Apple's  latest laptops left many fans disgruntled, and the Mac Pro has gone years without an update. Apple is now moving quickly to address complaints from its high-end ""pro"" users — it  says the Mac Pro will be redesigned, and a new Pro version of the iMac is coming later this year.""I think Microsoft has recognized over the last couple years that maybe the creative community isn't as locked into the Mac as many people think it is,"" said Jan Dawson, an independent technology analyst. ""There's this window of opportunity for Surface to get in there — and even if that window closes with some of Apple's upcoming devices, I don't think Apple has that market locked up.""Last month, I visited Microsoft's hardware lab at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Wash. I arrived in the midst of a renovation, finding a team of its best hardware designers sitting in a cavernous, mostly empty room — a scene that perfectly captures Microsoft's approach to hardware.Under Panos Panay, Microsoft's Surface chief, the company has given its designers and engineers license to rethink the future of PCs in grand ways — to sit in an empty room, dream big things, and turn those visions into reality.""We have this mind-set that says, 'Hey, I'm going to take a shot at this, and if it's not going to work, we'll move on to the next thing,'"" Mr. Panay told me. ""That is celebrated — it's always, 'Let's go, let's move.'""The mind-set has resulted in several shining ideas. For Surface Studio, Microsoft built a brilliant companion device called Surface Dial — a palm-size knob that sits on your drafting-table screen, creating a tactile interface with which to control your computer.You can use Dial for basic things like turning up the volume. But in the hands of a designer, it becomes a lovely tool; you can scrub through edits in a video or change your pen color in Photoshop with a turn of the wheel. Like Microsoft's digital stylus — which works across the company's PCs and tablets, whereas Apple staunchly, weirdly opposes adding touch-screen abilities to its Macs — Dial is one of those interface breakthroughs that we might have once looked to Apple for. Now, it's Microsoft that's pushing new modes of computing.Microsoft's machines aren't perfect. I found Surface Studio, which starts at $3,000, to be underpowered for its price. Surface Pro is a wonderful laptop, but as a tablet, it isn't as good as the iPad. And it, too, is pricey — though it starts at $800, you're looking at $1,200 to $1,500 to get a model with decent speeds and the pen and keyboard accessories (crazily, they're sold separately).For these reasons and others, it's unlikely that Microsoft's PC hardware business will beat Apple's anytime soon. But anyone who cares about the future of the PC should be thrilled that Apple now faces a serious and creative competitor."

Earlier, Microsoft said it was considering ditching Paint.  Microsoft is not killing off its Paint app in the next update of Windows 10, the company said late on Monday, after fears that the iconic software could be ditched.The U.S. technology company recently released a list which labeled Paint ""deprecated"", meaning it was considering removing the app when the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update gets released later this year.Fans on social media decried the potential death of Paint, which has been in existence for 32 years. But Microsoft released a blog post shortly after to clarify that Paint would not be completely removed, but instead made available via the Windows Store for free. ""Today, we've seen an incredible outpouring of support and nostalgia around MS Paint. If there's anything we learned, it's that after 32 years, MS Paint has a lot of fans. It's been amazing to see so much love for our trusty old app,"" Megan Saunders, a general manager at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post on Monday.""Amidst today's commentary around MS Paint we wanted to take this opportunity to set the record straight, clear up some confusion and share some good news: MS Paint is here to stay, it will just have a new home soon, in the Windows Store where it will be available for free.""Paint was introduced with the first version of Windows, called Windows 1.0 in November 1985. It was originally a licensed version of PC Paintbrush which was made by ZSoft Corporation.In the beginning, it supported 1-bit monochrome graphics, and it wasn't until Windows 98 that users could save images in the well-known JPEG file format.Last year, Microsoft unveiled Paint 3D, a new version of the classic software.

427,2017-07-24T13:39:14-0400," An AI coprocessor could handle image recognition without burning through a device's battery. The news comes after a report that Apple is working on an AI chip. Microsoft on Sunday  disclosed that it's working on a new coprocessor for its next HoloLens augmented reality headset that will be dedicated to handling artificial intelligence workloads.The idea is that with this new chip inside the main ""Holographic Processing Unit,"" the next-generation HoloLens will be able to do things like recognize objects in the line of sight, but its battery won't be exhausted too quickly, because the main chip won't need to do the extra computing work.""We really do need custom silicon to help power some of the scenarios and applications that we are building,"" as Microsoft's chief technology officer, Kevin Scott, told  Bloomberg.In the past few years, as AI has become trendy, many app makers have shunted the necessary underlying computations, like recognizing the words that people say, to servers in remote data centers. So chipmakers like Intel and Nvidia have begun adjusting their silicon accordingly, and Alphabet has even designed its own chips.But for some applications, it's not desirable or realistic to expect a robust internet connection that can provide a backbone for those connections from a local mobile device to a cloud. Earlier this year a Google executive said he expects mobile device makers to come up with new processors for AI. And there are indications that Apple is preparing to unveil an AI chip for the iPhone.Now it turns out Microsoft is also working on optimizing AI on lower-powered devices. The HoloLens is by no means today a mass-market device — sales were said to be in the thousands. But whatever the company learns from the affair could surely be valuable for the development of future products — although they probably won't be phones.Microsoft worked with Cadence and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. on the original special processor for the HoloLens, which worked with a standard onboard Intel chip. Cadence and Microsoft declined to comment. TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Microsoft stock flattened out after the company offered guidance for the next quarter, however, before moving slightly higher again in premarket trading. The earnings report comes as Microsoft intensifies focus on its cloud business. Microsoft stock rose by as much as 4 percent after the company reported its earnings for the fourth quarter of its 2017 fiscal year, which ended on June 30. The stock flattened out after the company offered guidance for the next quarter, however, before moving slightly higher again in premarket trading.The company beat analysts' estimates on earnings per share and revenue. EPS: Excluding certain items, 98 cents in earnings per share vs. 71 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: Excluding certain items, $24.7 billion vs. $24.27 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters.  Azure revenue increased 97 percent year over year, and Azure's gross margin improved in the quarter, Microsoft said in its earnings statement. In the cloud business that Microsoft is so focused on these days, Alphabet with its G Suite and Google Cloud Platform, represents competition. Amazon is also a significant player with its market-leading Amazon Web Services public cloud. In its earnings statements Microsoft doesn't provide exact revenue for Azure, but the company does talk about Azure revenue under its commercial cloud heading, which also includes Dynamics 365 and Office 365 commercial plans. Microsoft's commercial cloud ""strength should continue as unit and pricing trends remain positive,"" Stifel analysts Brad Reback and Adam Borg noted earlier this week, providing an estimate of an $18 billion annualized revenue run rate. In fact commercial cloud came in at a $18.9 billion revenue run rate, meaning that the figure has more than doubled in the past two years.Microsoft's Dynamics 365 revenue was up 74 percent, while Dynamics in total increased 7 percent. Commercial Office 365 revenue went up 43 percent.LinkedIn contributed $1.1 billion in revenue to Microsoft's Productivity and Business Processes segment, whose revenue jumped 21 percent.Revenue growth in server products and cloud services revenue contributed to the 11 percent gain in Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment.The More Personal Computing segment was the laggard of the bunch, dropping 2 percent. Phone revenue dropped by $361 million and Surface revenue went down 2 percent, but the division was buoyed by gains from Windows, games, and search ads. Bing growth was a factor in the 8 percent search ad revenue boost; Microsoft said search volume and revenue per search both went up. With the Surface revenue slide, Microsoft said it sold fewer units, but that factor was offset by the introduction of ""a higher mix of premium devices."" New Surface products include the Surface Laptop and revamped Surface Pro. ""I'm expecting an uptick in Surface the next quarter as Surface Laptop and Surface Pro become fully available across all channels and countries,"" analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights &amp; Strategy told CNBC in an email. Xbox hardware revenue fell 29 percent; Microsoft pointed to lower prices and a decline in the number of consoles it sold.For the full fiscal year, Microsoft made $25.9 billion in non-GAAP net income, or $21.2 billion in GAAP net income. Non-GAAP revenue for the full fiscal year was $96.7 billion.  In terms of guidance, excluding corporate and other revenue, Microsoft expects to post $23.6-24.3 billion in revenue in the first quarter of its 2018 fiscal year, which ends on September 30, chief financial officer Amy Hood said on the company's earnings call. After Hood provided those numbers, Microsoft stock dropped in after-hours trading, falling to as much as 1.5 percent below the stock's $74.22 closing price.Earlier this month, the company said it would lay off thousands of employees, primarily in sales, in an effort to boost its cloud business as it begins its 2018 fiscal year. Microsoft stock hit an all-time intra-day high of $74.30 today ahead of earnings. Microsoft stock has increased more than 18 percent since the beginning of the year. "

Microsoft CFO Amy Hood called out the achievement during the company's earnings call. The company introduced Office 365 in 2010. Microsoft's collection of cloud apps for businesses have hit a new milestone. They now bring in more revenue than licenses for desktop Office apps and on-premises servers like Exchange.""For the first time, Office 365 Commercial revenue surpassed revenue from our traditional licensing business,"" Microsoft chief financial officer Amy Hood said Thursday on the earnings call for the fourth quarter of the company's 2017 fiscal year.The figure applies only to the quarter and does not include revenue for consumer subscriptions to Office 365, a spokeswoman told CNBC in an email.In the quarter Office 365 commercial revenue grew 43 percent, according to Microsoft's earnings report. That growth contributed partly to Microsoft's annualized commercial cloud revenue run rate, which hit $18.9 billion. ""I feel very good,"" Hood said, about meeting the goal Microsoft set two years ago to reach $20 billion in annualized commercial cloud revenue run rate.Microsoft introduced Office 365 in 2010. Today commercial customers can get access to apps like Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and OneDrive.

""It's free to put your data in, but to get your data out, it costs a substantial amount of money. That creates a whole data gravity issue where data gets locked in the cloud.""To counter that, the companies will allow their mutual customers to move data between their services for free, or, in the case of Microsoft, for a discount of about 75 percent from the list prices. Alphabet Inc's Google Cloud also offers discounts through a previously established program with Cloudflare and others.There's an element of self-interest for the companies involved: They all compete with AWS, and, in many cases, would stand to benefit if it were cheaper to move data back and forth between AWS and their services. And Cloudflare, which is leading the effort because its so-called content delivery network acts like a glue that connects many of the cloud providers together, competes directly with an AWS service called CloudFront.Amazon did not have an immediate comment on the alliance. But it has inked some deals to allow customers to move data freely, such as an alliance with Salesforce.com that lets their joint customers transfer data. Microsoft, Adobe Systems Inc and SAP SE this week made a similar deal to share mutual customer data.Prince said the Bandwidth Alliance is currently a pact among the members, but if it gains traction it hopes to spin off into its own independent association or nonprofit entity. The aim is to make it cheaper to choose from a buffet of cloud services, for example tapping Google's analytics offerings, Amazon's data storage and IBM's Watson artificial intelligence.""You basically have to pick your provider and stick with that provider forever. We're starting to see the attitudes around that change,"" Prince said. (Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Sandra Maler)"
435,2012-10-25T17:39:00-0400,"* Windows 8, Surface tablet on sale at midnight* CEO Ballmer sees Windows 8 recasting PC industry* New York Times, Amazon launch new appsNEW YORK, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp launched its new Windows 8 operating system and Surface tablet on Thursday in a bid to revive interest in its flagship product and regain ground lost to Apple Inc and Google Inc in mobile computing.``We've reimagined Windows and we've reimagined the whole PC industry,'' Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told Reuters Television.Windows 8 devices and the company's new Surface tablet, which aims to challenge Apple's popular iPad head on, go on sale at midnight on Thursday.Steven Sinofsky, head of Microsoft's Windows unit and the driving force behind Windows 8, opened the launch event in New York in front about 1,000 media and PC industry partners.He showed off Windows 8's new touch-optimized design, but emphasized that the system was built upon the base of Windows 7, Microsoft's best-selling software that recently passed 670 million license sales.While Windows 7 was introduced three years ago, Windows 8 represents the biggest change in Microsoft's user interface since Windows 95 came out 17 years ago.The radical redesign, which dispenses with the Start button and features square tiles for apps, may surprise some users. Initial demand for Windows 8 appeared solid, but customers were wary.``We've seen steady pre-order sales on Windows 8 devices from early adopters,'' said Merle McIntosh, senior vice president of product management at online electronics retailer Newegg. ``However, we expect that most average consumers are waiting until after launch to make a purchase decision.''REVIEWERS, INVESTORS UNCERTAINMicrosoft is offering several versions of Windows 8. The basic Windows 8, the full Windows 8 Pro and Windows 8 Enterprise for large organizations will all run on the traditional PCs, laptops and new tablets using Intel Corp chips.Through the end of January, users running Windows XP, Windows Vista or Windows 7 can download an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro for $40.For the first time, Microsoft has also created a version called Windows RT which will be pre-installed on its Surface tablet and other devices using low-power chips designed by ARM Holdings.Early reviews of the Surface tablet, which starts at $499, have been mixed, with praise for its slick hardware, but concerns about battery life and limited software and applications available.Microsoft has not said how many apps Windows 8 will have at launch, but it is expected to be a fraction of the 275,000 available to iPad users. The New York Times Co announced a reader app for Windows 8 on Thursday, and Amazon.com Inc launched a Kindle e-book app for the new system, but some big names such as Facebook Inc are not expected to feature.Investors were uncertain about the prospects for success of Windows 8, but many feel a solid launch could help Microsoft's stock, which has languished between $20 and $30 for much of the last decade.Apple's shares have significantly outperformed Microsoft's over the past 10 years, and its market value is now more than double Microsoft's. Microsoft shares were up 0.3 percent at $27.99 on Thursday afternoon, while Apple shares were down 0.8 percent at $611.70.``This really is about debunking the notion that Microsoft is a dinosaur and they are relevant in a new climate of tablets and mobile,'' said Todd Lowenstein, portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management, which holds Microsoft shares.``Extreme pessimism and almost utter failure is priced into the shares, so any kind of positive delivery on units, customer perception, would be really beneficial to the stock.''"
436,2012-10-24T23:28:00-0400,"* New system, Surface tablet debut Friday* App availability, store demand, reviews important* Key PC sales numbers expected in JanuarySEATTLE, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Firm sales numbers for Microsoft Corp's Windows 8 and its new Surface tablet will not be available for three months, but it may be clear long before then if it has a hit on its hands.``We can definitely gauge it by chatter,'' said Emily Chan, an analyst at Bernstein Research. ``There is a slight learning curve, so I don't think we will see that big pop that iPad saw.''Microsoft is desperate for the new-look, touch-friendly Windows 8 to grip customers' imaginations, as it looks to regain ground lost to Apple Inc and Google Inc in mobile computing and shake up the moribund PC market.Perhaps more important is its new own-brand tablet called the Surface, available only through its own stores and website, which will challenge Apple's iPad head on.``I'd want to know the sales - and return rate - of the Surface,'' said Sarah Rotman Epps at tech research firm Forrester. ``But those numbers will be hard to get since Microsoft is the only retailer.''Early reviews of the Surface have been mixed, generally praising the slick hardware, but faulting battery life and the limited software and applications available.Some worry that the first Surface model, which runs on a stripped-down version of Windows 8 called RT that is not compatible with old Windows programs, will cause some confusion and dissatisfaction among customers.The three models for sale on Microsoft's U.S. website are already on back order, suggesting strong demand, but it is not known how many Surfaces Microsoft has manufactured.``The fact it's back ordered is indicative that there's consumer interest,'' said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner. ``How Microsoft introduces it, evangelizes it and explains it will determine long term success.''BALLMER NOISEMicrosoft has not said if it will reveal sales figures for Windows 8 or of the Surface before its next scheduled earnings on Jan. 24. The company tends to trumpet good news and stay silent otherwise.After the launch of Windows 7 three years ago, CEO Steve Ballmer waited only a month to announce strong sales. A year later, he waited only 10 days to report record-breaking sales of the Kinect, the motion-sensing add-on for the Xbox. But Microsoft has never shared the sales of Windows-powered phones, which have a lowly 3 percent of the market.If Ballmer stays silent about Windows 8 sales, it might indicate a less than stellar performance.``I would definitely take it a sign that it's not super, super strong, but I won't take it as something negative,'' said Chan at Bernstein, who is expecting 8.3 million Surface sales by the middle of next year.That averages out at about 1 million a month, a third the rate of the iPad, which notched up its first million sales in 28 days and has now sold more than 100 million units, averaging about 3.2 million a month.Gartner forecasts that Surface and other tablets running Windows RT will sell about 2.3 million units this year and 9.3 million next year, grabbing about 2 percent and 5 percent of the worldwide tablet market, respectively.DOOR-BUSTERSRetail activity will be closely watched. Microsoft will have more than 60 brick and mortar stores open for the release of Windows 8 on Friday, half of them 'pop-up' stores that will stay open for the holiday shopping season.Third-party retailers are cautiously optimistic.``We have seen pretty good response to our pre-orders for Windows 8,'' said Best Buy Co Inc spokesman Jeff Haydock. ``Quite honestly, I don't know what to expect from Friday. I don't know if there will be lines or not. My sense is it will take some time for people to kind of come into the stores and check it out.''Best Buy may give some color on how PC sales are going when it reports earnings on Nov. 20.Wal-Mart Stores Inc, the No. 1 U.S. retailer, said U.S. pre-orders for Windows 8 PCs ``have been better than expected.''Online retailers Amazon.com Inc, Newegg Inc and TigerDirect Inc have been silent on Windows 8 pre-orders.The full impact of PC sales on retailers will not be evident until chains report same-store sales for November.QUICK REACTIONOne early indicator of Windows 8's success will be the contents of the online Windows Store. Microsoft has had a harder time drumming up interest among developers for Windows 8, given the risk that there will be fewer users than competing platforms.Microsoft will not disclose numbers, but there are expected to be 5,000 or so third-party apps available to U.S. users, in comparison with the iPad's 275,000. Some big names such as Facebook Inc will be missing.In social media, the tenor of comments on the Twitter hashtags #Windows8 and #Surface will give an indication of their reception after Ballmer unveils them both on Thursday.Many users likely will be shocked by the new design, which dispenses with the Start button and features square tiles for apps.``Public reaction to the new UI will depend how well Microsoft explains why 'different' is better and teaches how the new experience works,'' said Gartenberg. ``That all starts on Thursday.''BY THE NUMBERSThe ultimate test for Windows 8 will be PC sales.Industry trackers are expecting a bump for PC sales in the last two months of the year, but not enough to rescue the whole year, which is forecast to dip for the first time since 2001.Some analysts had expected an uptick in production of laptops ahead of the Windows 8 launch, but PC makers facing an uncertain global economy have been wary about committing.Chip maker Intel Corp, which is a good gauge of future PC demand due to its position early in the production process, expects the PC business to grow at only half the normal seasonal rate in the fourth quarter.Chief Executive Paul Otellini recently told analysts he expects to have a better understanding of the success of Windows 8 in 90 days.Stephen Baker, an analyst at retail research firm NPD Group, is expecting a 10 percent jump in PC sales for November and December over last year, but said comparisons will be difficult given a profusion of new devices and the volatility of year-ago data.Fourth-quarter PC shipment numbers from research firms Gartner and IDC will not be published until early January, although analysts say PC makers might start to drop hints about demand before then.``There will likely be many milestones, but very few will ultimately be decisive. The key point is will PC sales continue to shrink or will they experience a boost,'' said Al Hilwa at research firm IDC. ``We can probably begin to properly judge that with some ambiguity in January.''(Additional reporting By Dhanya Skariachan in New York, Jessica Wohl in Chicago and Noel Randewich in San Francisco.

437,2017-07-12T08:37:34-0400," The app was previously only available on a type of smart glasses.  Microsoft is also starting to come up with AI design guidelines. Microsoft is putting its artificial intelligence technology to work to help the visually impaired.The company said on Wednesday that it's releasing an iOS app called Seeing AI that uses an iPhone's camera to tell people about objects in front of them. The app shows off Microsoft's current capabilities in AI, while also addressing a group that the technology industry too often ignores.Microsoft first revealed the technology to an audience of developers last year, but at the time it was only shown as working on smart glasses. Now anyone with an iPhone or iPad can try it.Microsoft isn't saying whether Seeing AI will become available on Android. Still, its arrival on iOS is the latest example of Microsoft, under CEO Satya Nadella, embracing third-party platforms.For example, Microsoft brought its SQL Server database software to Linux, and it has ported Office apps to the iPad. Most recently it added support for Apple's MacBook Pro Touch Bar in Office apps.Microsoft also said it will be developing a set of design guidelines for AI-infused features in products to ensure a greater degree of transparency and to emphasize ethics. The announcement comes two days after Google introduced a new research initiative around improving the design of its own AI systems for users, professionals and researchers. Additionally, Microsoft is rejiggering staffers within the artificial intelligence and research group that it formed in September. Under the leadership of Eric Horvitz, the new Microsoft Research AI program is designed to bring together around 100 people who specialize in different technologies categorized under AI, instead of having them spread out in Microsoft AI and Research, which includes around 6,000 people, a Microsoft spokesman said."
438,2017-07-11T07:08:32-0400," Microsoft plans to announce on Tuesday a new campaign to try to ""eliminate"" the gap in high-speed internet access in the country's hardest-to-reach areas. The company's so-called Rural Airband Initiative is an attempt to partner with local providers to boost wireless internet. The software giant plans to start its efforts in 12 states, offering seed money to local telecom providers that are trying to improve internet access. Microsoft plans to announce on Tuesday a new campaign to try to ""eliminate"" the gap in high-speed internet access in the country's hardest-to-reach areas — an effort called the Rural Airband Initiative, which will set an ambitious target of bringing better broadband to two million Americans within the next five years.The Redmond, Wash.-based software giant plans to start its efforts in 12 states, offering seed money — Microsoft wouldn't specify the amount — to local telecom providers that are trying to improve internet access through means like ""white spaces,"" which are the invisible, wireless radio airwaves that aren't already owned by broadcasters.More from Recode:The Trump administration is delaying a key program for foreign entrepreneursWatch Amazon wreak stock-price havoc this month on competitors of all stripesBest Buy lost $1 billion in value on the news of Amazon's Geek Squad competitorFrom Microsoft point of view, this approach — aimed at delivering speedy wireless internet — is the best way to improve connectivity in parts of the country that broadband providers long have ignored, given the prohibitive costs of building and sustaining networks there. By Microsoft's count, more than 23 million Americans in rural areas currently lack high-speed internet access, despite billions of dollars in federal investment.But the company emphasized that it is not looking to become a telecom provider — it's only providing capital to local firms — and does not seek to profit from the endeavor. Through revenue-sharing agreements, Microsoft instead plans to invest any money it raises in additional projects in other states where internet access is lacking.Microsoft president Brad Smith is slated to unveil the project during a speech in Washington, D.C., later on Tuesday. He declined to be interviewed for this story.Microsoft faces a daunting task in bridging the country's digital divide.For one thing, these ""white spaces"" aren't available in every market in the United States. Rather, Microsoft wants the Federal Communications Commission to reserve more of that spectrum for unlicensed use in the coming months. But the idea has been met with stiff opposition from broadcasters, which generally have to pay to obtain that spectrum from the U.S. government.Nor are ""white spaces"" some panacea for the country's broadband ills: Even Microsoft acknowledges in its announcement that other technologies, like internet delivered by satellite, are necessary to improve connectivity in the country's most remote regions. At the moment, Microsoft has not announced any specific investments in that technology.For now, the initial targets are 12 states: Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, New York, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin, a spokesman told Recode. In Virginia, Microsoft previously announced a partnership with a local network to provide free broadband in two communities where 50 percent of students have no internet connectivity.Through its philanthropic organization, Microsoft also plans to work with groups like the National 4-H Council, a youth-development effort, as the tech giant tries to boost digital literacy training.Meanwhile, Microsoft will set about lobbying in Washington, D.C., seeking the release of more ""white spaces"" as well as new federal investments in U.S. broadband. The tech company has specifically called for government funding on a ""matching basis"" with private sector dollars, a position that aligns closely with the Trump administration, where senior officials have mulled a major infrastructure package — valued at $1 trillion — that would rely heavily on public-private partnerships.—By Tony Romm, Recode.net.

441,2013-03-06T06:37:13-0500,"  The European Union fined Microsoft Corp  561 million euros ($731 million) on Wednesday for failing to offer users a choice of Web browser, an unprecedented sanction that will act as a warning to other firms involved in EU antitrust disputes.    It said the U.S. software company had broken a legally binding commitment made in 2009 to ensure that consumers had a choice of how they access the internet, rather than defaulting to Microsoft's Explorer browser.   An investigation found that Microsoft had failed to honor that obligation in software issued between May 2011 and July 2012, meaning 15 million users were not given a choice.   It is the first time the European Commission, the EU's anti-trust authority, has handed down a fine to a company for failing to meet its obligations.   While the sanction is sizeable, representing more than 11 percent of Microsoft's expected net profit this quarter and 1 percent of annual sales, the Commission could have charged the company up to 10 percent of annual global revenue.  The world's largest software company can easily pay the fine out of its $68 billion in cash reserves. It holds $61 billion of that outside the United States, much of it in Europe, to take advantage of low tax rates.    Microsoft shares fell 0.9 percent to $28.09 on Nasdaq.   (Read More: Microsoft Earnings Narrowly Beat Street Forecast)   ""If companies agree to offer commitments which then become legally binding, they must do what they have committed to do or face the consequences,"" Joaquin Almunia, the EU's competition commissioner, told a news conference.    ""I hope this decision will make companies think twice before they even think of intentionally breaching their obligations or even of neglecting their duty to ensure strict compliance.""    Microsoft said it took full responsibility for the incident, which it has blamed on a technical error.    The board cut chief executive Steve Ballmer's bonus last year partly as a result, and also faulted former Windows head Steven Sinofsky who left the company last year for unrelated reasons.    The company did not say whether it would challenge the ruling, but it is not expected to do so, largely so as not to antagonise regulators.    ""We have apologized for it,"" Microsoft said in a statement.    ""We provided the Commission with a complete and candid assessment of the situation, and we have taken steps to strengthen our software development and other processes to help avoid this mistake - or anything similar - in the future.""    Almunia said regulators may have made a mistake by allowing Microsoft to police its own behaviour instead of appointing an external trustee to ensure compliance with the commitments.    ""In 2009, we were even more naive than today,"" he said.   Warning Shot to Google, Others   Microsoft's fine is a good example of the Commission's hard line approach toward companies which disregard rules whether deliberately or not, said Charles Whiddington, a partner at London-based law firm Field Fisher Waterhouse.    ""The implications for companies going forward is that they must be more rigorous in complying with any agreement with the Commission, which does not take prisoners for infractions,"" he said.    ""Companies face severe sanctions for flouting EU rules, even accidentally.""    Wednesday's fine brings the total of EU fines issued against Microsoft over the past decade to more than 2.2 billion euros, making it the world's worst offender of EU rules.  While the charge could have been higher, it still marks a firm sanction and will be noted by the likes of Google, which is involved in a dispute with the Commission over how it ranks search engine results.    Google is under pressure to offer concessions to prevent the Commission moving to the next stage in the case, which could involve fines. Other major technology companies such as Samsung Electronics are also under investigation.   Wednesday's decision is expected to help Microsoft draw a line under its troubles in Europe as it gears up for an intensified battle against Google. Microsoft is one of the complainants in the EU's investigation into the search giant.    Almunia has also signaled EU regulators' concern over antitrust issues in the links between technology platform owners and application developers, in a move that could spell trouble for Apple Inc and Google, whose iPads and Android tablets are leading the growth of the computer market.    (Read More: Microsoft Is Losing $2.5 Billion a Year by NOT Being on iPad)  Relations between the EU's antitrust body and Microsoft have frequently been tense. In 2004, the Commission found that the company had abused its dominant market position by tying Windows Media Player to the Windows software package.    In 2009, in order to resolve other competition concerns, Microsoft undertook to offer users a browser choice screen allowing them to download a browser other than Explorer.    The Commission made that obligation legally binding for five years, until 2014, and initially the company complied. From March 2010 until November 2010, 84 million browsers were downloaded via the screen, the Commission said.     But the Windows 7 service pack 1 rolled out between mid-2011 and mid-2012 failed to offer the choice, leading to the investigation that resulted in Wednesday's fine.    In calculating the fine, the Commission said it had taken into account that Microsoft had cooperated by providing information that had helped speed up the investigation.   Analysts always found it odd that Microsoft would have purposefully failed to offer a choice of browsers via its software given that the potential fine for such a failure would far exceed any potential income from not offering it.    Microsoft's share of the European browser market has more than halved since 2008 to 24 percent. Google's Chrome has a 35 percent share, followed by Mozilla's Firefox with 29 percent, according to Web traffic analysis company StatCounter.     Given Microsoft's fading power in the browser market, some questioned the size and point of the fine.   ""As always, the regulators are late to the party,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. ""How did the EU come up with that figure in damages? There are no restrictions as to being able to place a new browser on the PC and it's really kind of clear that Microsoft isn't benefiting monetarily from the browser at this point.""  "
442,2018-10-29T19:05:00-0400,"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - Intel Corp has increased the ratio of women and African-Americans in its workforce after three years of a high-profile effort to improve diversity, the U.S. microchip maker said in a report released on Monday.Intel still lags behind several large U.S. technology companies in terms of women and ahead of many for African Americans and Hispanics, the report showed. Chronic underrepresentation of minorities has been a source of concern for years at tech companies.Overall, women comprised 26.8 percent of Intel's U.S. workforce in 2018, up from 24.7 percent in 2015. Women in leadership positions grew to 20.7 percent from 17.7 percent.The percentage of African Americans at Intel has risen to nearly 5 percent from 3.5 percent in 2015 and Hispanics rose to 9.2 percent from 8.3 percent.""Although we are among the leaders in African American representation in the tech industry, we are still not satisfied,"" Barbara Whye, Intel's chief diversity and inclusion officer said by email. The company will continue to work with historically black colleges and the Oakland Unified School District in California, she added.Without providing figures, Intel said it had reached ""full representation"" two years ahead of its goal based on skilled minorities in the available workforce.In 2015, Intel established a $300 million fund to be used by 2020 to improve diversity. Whites make up 46.2 percent of the workforce at the company, and Asians 38.9 percent, according to Intel.Intel's African American 2018 representation was better than at Facebook Inc, Alphabet Inc, and Microsoft Corp, according to the companies' latest data.But its female representation was behind Facebook, Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, and only ahead of Microsoft.

443,2019-01-08T12:00:22-0500,"More than a dozen former Facebook employees detailed how the company's leadership and its performance review system has created a culture where any dissent is discouraged.Employees say Facebook's stack ranking performance review system drives employees to push out products and features that drive user engagement without fully considering potential long-term negative impacts on user experience or privacy.Reliance on peer reviews creates an underlying pressure for Facebook employees to forge friendships with colleagues for the sake of career advancement.At a company-wide town hall in early October, numerous Facebook employees got in line to speak about their experiences with sexual harassment.The company called the special town hall after head of policy Joel Kaplan caused an internal uproar for appearing at the congressional hearing for Judge Brett Kavanaugh. A young female employee was among those who got up to speak, addressing her comments directly to COO Sheryl Sandberg.""I was reticent to speak, Sheryl, because the pressure for us to act as though everything is fine and that we love working here is so great that it hurts,"" she said, according to multiple former Facebook employees who witnessed the event.""There shouldn't be this pressure to pretend to love something when I don't feel this way,"" said the employee, setting off a wave of applause from her colleagues at the emotional town hall in Menlo Park, California.The episode speaks to an atmosphere at Facebook in which employees feel pressure to place the company above all else in their lives, fall in line with their manager's orders and force cordiality with their colleagues so they can advance. Several former employees likened the culture to a ""cult.""This culture has contributed to the company's well-publicized wave of scandals over the last two years, such as governments spreading misinformation to try to influence elections and the misuse of private user data, according to many people who worked there during this period. They say Facebook might have have caught some of these problems sooner if employees were encouraged to deliver honest feedback. Amid these scandals, Facebook's share price fell nearly 30 percent in 2018 and nearly 40 percent since a peak in July, resulting in a loss of more than $252 billion in market capitalization.Meanwhile, Facebook's reputation as being one of the best places in Silicon Valley to work is starting to show some cracks. According to Glassdoor, which lets employees anonymously review their workplaces, Facebook fell from being the best place to work in the U.S. to No. 7 in the last year.But employees don't complain in the workplace.""There's a real culture of 'Even if you are f---ing miserable, you need to act like you love this place,'"" said one ex-employee who left in October. ""It is not OK to act like this is not the best place to work.""This account is based on conversations with more than a dozen former Facebook employees who left between late 2016 and the end of 2018. These people requested anonymity in describing Facebook's work culture, including its ""stack ranking"" employee performance evaluation system and their experiences with it, because none is authorized by Facebook to talk about their time there. This stack ranking system is similar to the one that was notoriously used by Microsoft before the company abandoned it in 2013, the former Facebook employees said.Facebook declined to comment on former employees' characterization of the work place as ""cult-like.""Former employees describe a top-down approach where major decisions are made by the company's leadership, and employees are discouraged from voicing dissent — in direct contradiction to one of Sandberg's mantras, ""authentic self.""For instance, at an all-hands meeting in early 2017, one employee asked Facebook Vice President David Fischer a tough question about a company program. Fischer took the question and answered, but within hours, the employee and his managers received angry calls from the team running that program, this person said.""I never felt it was an environment that truly encouraged 'authentic self' and encouraged real dissent because the times I personally did it, I always got calls,"" said the former manager, who left the company in early 2018.The sentiment was echoed by another employee who left in 2017.""What comes with scale and larger operations is you can't afford to have too much individual voice,"" said this person. ""If you have an army, the larger the army is, the less individuals have voice. They have to follow the leader.""In this employee's two years at Facebook, his team grew from a few people to more than 50. He said ""it was very much implied"" to him and his teammates that they trust their leaders, follow orders and avoid having hard conversations.The company's culture of no-dissent prevented employees from speaking up about the impact that News Feed had on influencing the 2016 U.S. election, this person added.The message was clear in August 2016 when the company laid off the editorial staff of its trending news team, shortly after some workers on that team leaked to the press that they were suppressing conservative-leaning stories. Employees were further discouraged from speaking up following the election, when CEO Mark Zuckerberg brushed off the accusation that Facebook could have impacted the election, calling that idea ""crazy.""The former employee described ""a bubble"" at the company in which employees are dissuaded from giving managers critical feedback or challenging decisions.""I'm pretty disappointed in that because I have a lot of respect for Sheryl, and she preaches about giving hard feedback,"" the employee said.""All the things we were preaching, we weren't doing enough of them. We weren't having enough hard conversations. They need to realize that. They need to reflect and ask if they're having hard conversations or just being echo chambers of themselves.""Many former employees blamed the cult-like atmosphere partly on Facebook's performance review system, which requires employees to get reviews from approximately five of their peers twice a year. This peer review system pressures employees to forge friendships with colleagues at every possible opportunity, whether it be going to lunch together each day or hanging out after work.""It's a little bit of a popularity contest,"" said one manager who left the company in 2017. ""You can cherry-pick the people who like you — maybe throw in one bad apple to equalize it.""Peers can provide feedback directly to their colleagues, or they can send the reviews to the employee's manager. That feedback is typically treated as anonymous and cannot be challenged.""You have invisible charges against you, and that figures mightily into your review,"" said an employee who left in October. ""Your negative feedback can haunt you for all your days at Facebook.""Several former employees said that peers and managers iced them out because they had personal commitments or problems that required significant attention outside of work.For instance, one employee who left in recent weeks said a manager was critical in a public team meeting because the employee didn't attend a team-building event outside work. At the time, this person was going through a divorce.""She definitely marked me down for not attending those team-building events, but I couldn't attend because I was going through my own issues and needed work-life balance,"" said the employee.Employees are not required to attend after-hours events, according to a Facebook spokeswoman, adding that collaboration is important at the company.Another manager who also left the company in recent weeks said she once took multiple weeks of vacation instead of going on medical leave to treat a major illness. She says she did this based on advice from her supervisor.""I was afraid that if I told too many people or took too much time off, I would be seen as unable to do my job,"" the former manager said. ""I was scared that if I let up in any way, shape or form they would crumble me, and they did.""Ironically, one of the best ways to see the desperation to be liked is to follow Facebook employees on Facebook itself.Employees parade the company's projects and post any report on the benefits of working at the company or the positive impact the company is making on the world. This is in part a show for peers and managers, former employees said.""People are very mindful about who they're connected with on Facebook who they also work with and how what they're posting will put them in a favorable light to their managers,"" an employee who left in 2016 said.As with many social media users, the online content does not always reflect the offline emotions.""There's so many people there who are unhappy, but their Facebook posts alone don't reflect the backdoor conversations you have with people where they're crying and really unhappy,"" she said.Twice a year, this peer feedback comes into play in so-called calibration meetings, where employees are given one of seven grades.Managers deliberate with their peers to grade employees in all levels below them. As the review process moves up the chain over the course of multiple weeks, lower-level managers gradually leave the room, until the company's vice presidents finish the calibration. At this point, Zuckerberg and Sandberg sign off that their vice presidents have done due diligence, and each employee's grade for the past six months is finalized.But there's a companywide limit on the percentage of employees who can receive each grade. So during the reviews process, managers compete against their peer managers to secure strong grades for their direct reports. Managers are compelled to vouch fiercely for their favorite employees, but don't speak up for employees they don't like or who have previously received poor ratings.""There's a saying at Facebook that once you have one bad half, you're destined for bad halves the rest of your time there. That stigma will follow you,"" said a manager who left in September.According to two former executives, the grade breakdown is approximately as follows:""Redefine,"" the highest grade, is given to fewer than 5 percent of employees""Greatly exceeds expectations"": 10 percent""Exceeds"": 35 percent""Meets all"": 35 to 40 percent""Meets most,"" a low grade that puts future employment at risk, goes to most of the remaining 10 to 15 percent""Meets some"" grades are extremely rare and are seen as an indication that you're probably getting fired, according to multiple employees.""Does not meet"" are exceptionally rare, as most employees are fired before they get to that level.The distribution of these grades are not a hard limit but rather a recommended guidance for managers to follow, according to a Facebook spokeswoman.Facebook isn't the only tech company to use a performance evaluation system where a percentage of employees is pegged to each performance grade, meaning that there's always a fixed population at risk of being fired. Pioneered by Jack Welch at General Electric in the 1990s and sometimes known as ""stack ranking,"" this method is fairly common in Silicon Valley and was most notoriously used by Microsoft until the company got rid of it in 2013 after widespread employee complaints.Stack ranking systems work well at companies with competitive environments that compare employees on objectively measurable performance, according to Alexandra Michel, professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies work culture. However, the system tends to break down and cause distrust among employees and create a political atmosphere when applied by companies that measure performance subjectively, or companies that demand employee loyalty in exchange for benefits and the promise of career advancement, Michel said.""If you have an environment that is completely cutthroat like Wall Street, this system works pretty well,"" Michel said. ""But if you have employees who come in and want to be taken care of, want to learn, want to be part of a warm group and people who care about them — that's a very jarring mismatch.""Since early 2017, Facebook has become more rigorous in distributing grades by specific percentages, according to multiple former employees.""I had a boss literally say to me 'You don't have enough people in 'meets some,' 'meets most,' and 'meets all,'"" said a former director who left earlier this year. ""I was finding myself making up things to be hypercritical of employees to give them lower ratings than they really deserved.""These twice-yearly reviews encourage employees to be particularly productive around June and December, working nights and weekends as they race to impress bosses before reviews, which are typically completed in August and February. It's especially true in December, the half Facebook predominantly uses to determine which employees will receive promotions.This rush causes employees to focus on short-term goals and push out features that drive user engagement and improve their own metrics without fully considering potential long-term negative impacts on user experience or privacy, multiple former employees said.""If you're up for promotion, and it's based on whether you get a product out or not, you're almost certainly going to push that product out,"" a former engineer said. ""Otherwise you're going to have to wait another year to get that promotion.""As employees begin gathering peer reviews and buckling up for their next round of calibrations in February, the process will reveal how employees are thinking of the company after a bruising 2018, according to employees who left recently.There will be an extra level of anxiety around the process this time, one person said. Folks who have been wanting to leave will be hoping to notch a high rating so they can depart on good terms. Others who are committed to the company will be torn between speaking up about their concerns or staying in line for the sake of their careers. Any changes to company's grading process this time could reveal whether Facebook is taking special steps to keep valued employees around, or continuing along the same lines.""This review cycle will be particularly colorful for them,"" according to a director who left recently.WATCH: Here's how to see which apps have access to your Facebook data — and cut them off"

The firm also reaffirmed its overweight rating on the technology giant, calling Microsoft's Azure a ""public cloud winner."" It's not just Amazon that will make money from cloud computing and artificial intelligence, according to Wall Street.Morgan Stanley believes Microsoft's Azure business will thrive riding the same hot technology trends.The firm reiterated its overweight rating on Microsoft shares, predicting the company will report profits ahead of expectations next year due to cloud computing demand. Microsoft's ""top line drivers include the Azure (Microsoft emerging as a public cloud winner), data center (share gains and positive pricing trends), and O365 [Office 365] (base growth and per user pricing lift),"" analyst Keith Weiss wrote in a note to clients Monday.""With a strengthening secular positioning and rationalization of underperforming portions of the solution portfolio, Microsoft is back to showing durable double-digit EPS growth — and investors should be willing to pay a higher multiple for that growth,"" he added.Weiss raised his price target for Microsoft to $80 from $72, representing 14 percent upside from Friday's close. The analyst cited how the growing ""machine learning"" [artificial intelligence] trend will spur demand for the company's Azure cloud computing services and it could add up to $110 billion in market value for Microsoft. As a result, Weiss estimates Microsoft will generate fiscal 2018 earnings per share of $3.45 compared with the Wall Street consensus for $3.32.""Windows 10 gives Microsoft an improved story on tablets, a new leg of rev. growth and downstream opps. for synergy with the Surface, Xbox, and the device ecosystem,"" he wrote. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story."
445,2017-06-15T07:35:16-0400,"Alibaba has expanded its big data and artificial intelligence cloud product in Europe in a bid to boost its challenge to the likes of Amazon and Microsoft in the fast-growing space.  The product known as ""MaxCompute"" handles huge amounts of data allowing organizations to make predictions in real-time. Alibaba Cloud, the cloud division of the Chinese e-commerce titan, claims it can process around a petabyte of data such as video and audio. A petabyte is 1,000,000 gigabytes.  For example in China, the product was used by the Guangdong province to analyze traffic so city planners could make decisions on when to change the traffic lights more efficiently, in real-time. This led to a large reduction in traffic, according to Wanli Min, AI and data mining scientist at Alibaba Cloud.  ""With this system, you can prevent the traffic jam from happening in the first place,"" Min told CNBC by phone. Alibaba has been expanding its cloud presence beyond China since 2015 by partnering with companies. In 2016, it opened its first data center in Europe, based in Germany.  Offering more services such as MaxCompute is a way for it to get recurring revenues from its customers as well as differentiating itself against the market leaders Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft.  But both these U.S. tech giants have their own big data and AI offerings. Min said the winner will be the one who shows tangible impact from their technology and Alibaba Cloud has strong AI capabilities.  ""The real differentiator who can transform from real time analytics to actionable insight. That transformation who can deliver the tangible impact, that is the key differentiator,"" Min said. Alibaba Cloud has not revealed how many customers they have in Europe but said it's in discussions with companies about using ComputeMax. The company did not disclose the pricing for the product, but said customers would pay depending on how much they use.  ""I think clearly this technology could be a good partner for some big players in this market,"" Min said. Alibaba's cloud business has been growing rapidly. The number of paying customers in the fiscal year ended March 31, stood at 874,000, up from 513,000 the year before. Meanwhile revenue in the same period was up 121 percent to 6.6 billion yuan ($971.5 billion). Cloud is still a small business for Alibaba, however, accounting for just 4 percent of revenues."
446,2017-06-14T12:21:43-0400,"As shares of Microsoft, along with its other big tech peers, recovered after a notable two-day losing streak, one trader is making a unique bet on the tech giant settling into a trading range ahead of its quarterly earnings report in July.By using a type of options trade called an ""iron condor,"" Todd Gordon of TradingAnalysis.com is planning to capitalize on the relatively high price of options on the stock, along with his expectations that Microsoft shares are likely to move sideways.""Microsoft, as well as the broader market, has had a very nice move up over the last nine months, following a very orderly uptrend. It appears that the last consolidation we saw was back in the second half of summer 2016, into early fall. So that consolidation is right in this range, so it lasted about three to four months,"" Gordon said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation.""""It looks to me, based on the technicals that we're following, that Microsoft could be falling into a similar range"" this time around, he added.Yet while he sees the stock as being range-bound, he points out that ""implied volatility is moving up due to this recent sell-off in tech, as well as earnings that are coming up on July 20. I would like to take advantage of this overbought volatility, which means options are expensive,"" Gordon said.Specifically, Gordon plans to sell the July 67.50-strike puts, and buy the July 65-strike puts, meaning he is selling the put spread for a net credit of about 40 cents per share; on the other side, Gordon plans to sell the July 72.50-strike calls and buy the July 75-strike calls, meaning he is selling a call spread for a net credit of about 60 cents per share.The ""iron condor"" thus combines a short call spread with a short put spread. In this case, Gordon will get to keep his entire credit of $1.00 per share, or $100 per options spread, so long as the stock is between $67.50 and $72.50 on July 21.""What we're essentially doing is defining a range in which we think Microsoft will exist heading into July monthly options,"" he explained.Below and above those levels, Gordon stands to lose money. However, the fact that he bought a call and a put for protection limits his potential loss. In this case, his maximum loss is $1.50 per share, or $150 per options spread.The shape of the profit-and-loss graphic for this structure — a flat maximum profit, declining in ""wings"" on both sides to a flat maximum loss — is what gives the trade its avian name.Interestingly, the iron condor expresses a market view that would be very difficult to profit from without the use of options.""Done properly, options are a wonderful way to potentially make money in a sideways market in high implied volatility situations,"" Gordon said."
447,2017-06-12T11:11:16-0400,"  Microsoft unveiled its new console, the Xbox One X, on Sunday. The console will boast more powerful technology, including support for 4K gaming and virtual reality compatibility.  The new hardware will be launched Nov. 7 and will cost $499. Sony's PlayStation 4 outsold Microsoft's Xbox One in software sales.  Before this console generation even got underway, Microsoft found itself in the unfamiliar position of having to play defense.The Xbox 360 was a rousing success and the company had led the way in making the video game console a true living room component (by integrating Netflix into the system). It also pioneered online console gameplay and was a publisher favorite, often getting first shot at downloadable content for hot games.But Sony reset the playing field with the PlayStation 4. To date, it has sold 60 million of the consoles worldwide. As for the Xbox One, no one knows, as Microsoft stopped giving sales updates in 2015. But software sales and a shift in publisher exclusives to Sony indicate the PlayStation 4 has a healthy lead over the Xbox One. Now Microsoft is hoping to get back in the fight.On Sunday, the company publicly showed Xbox One X for the first time. Announced last year as ""Project Scorpio,"" the beefed-up console will enable true 4K gaming and offer support for virtual reality headsets, while still being compatible with all existing Xbox One titles.""We viewed compatibility as critical for Xbox One X,"" says Kareem Choudhry, ‎corporate vice president of Xbox software engineering at Microsoft. ""Right from the start, all Xbox One accessories and games will work with Xbox One X. … The game library you have today will be even better with Xbox One X with ... faster load times [and improved graphics]. Even if you haven't made the jump to a 4K TV yet, we made this Xbox for you.""It's Microsoft's most direct assault on Sony since the launch of this generation.""Microsoft thinks this is a 15-round championship boxing match with Sony, so they're going to take some swings with [Xbox One X] and try to win some of the middle rounds against what they think is a slowing down PS4 market,"" says P.J. McNealy of Digital World Research.Xbox One X's not a cheap system, though, even by video game standards. When it hits shelves this Nov. 7, it will cost $499. That's almost certain to scare off casual buyers and could even give the most dedicated hardcore gamers pause.""We expect [Xbox One X] to underwhelm at retail, as has PS4 Pro, which costs $399,"" says Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities.Hardware is only part of the battle, of course. The key to any victory in the video game world is software sales. And while plenty of publishers voiced their support for Xbox One X at Microsoft's press event (which showcased 42 new games), exclusives like the company boasted last generation were nowhere to be found. And it's at least another year before the company will have a new installment in its flagship ""Halo"" series ready.""There hasn't been a lot of really great software,"" says Ben Schachter of Macquarie Capital. ""The exclusives from third parties aren't there. We need to see more interesting first-party exclusives or something special on the virtual reality/mixed reality side. ... You need to show people why there is a reason to upgrade.""Beyond its immediate impact on Microsoft's standing in the industry, the release of Xbox One X raises questions about the video game hardware world at large. Specifically, have the days of ""next generation"" consoles given way to regular hardware upgrades, much like the model Apple has formulated so well with the iPhone?Microsoft has been pretty clear that could be the case, with Aaron Greenberg, head of Xbox games marketing, saying last year: ""We think the future is without console generations.""That's a big bet — especially if Sony doesn't play along. And despite putting out the upgraded PlayStation 4 Pro last year, Microsoft's chief competitor doesn't seem eager to follow the same path.""I still firmly believe the normal step change of a platform life cycle is very important,"" says Andrew House, global chief executive of Sony Interactive Entertainment, the company's video game division. ""I think the fact that the technology resets mean you get to reset the medium every five to seven years and I still think that's very positive. Yes, you've got rising production values and often costs, but you do have the opportunity to essentially reinvent the medium and bring something new and different to it. ... I don't think we, as a category, should walk away from that."""

That's twice the price of the standard Xbox One and $100 more than Sony's beefed up PlayStation 4, dubbed the PlayStation 4 Pro.Microsoft describes the system, which is now called Xbox One X and will hit shelves on Nov. 7, as the most advanced and powerful console systems the gaming industry has ever seen. At the same time, it will continue to play all games that have been released to date on Xbox One.""Xbox One X, the most powerful console ever made, sets a new standard for gamers and game creators,"" said Phil Spencer, head of Microsoft's Xbox division.Analysts are a bit less enthusiastic.""We expect (Xbox One X) to underwhelm at retail, as has PS4 Pro, which costs $399,"" said Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities in a pre-show note that speculated a $499 price tag.""The subdued sales numbers for the PS4 Pro since launch are partly a reflection of gamers opting for the older and cheaper hardware (sometimes with a pack-in) in order to save over $100. The potential price delta between Project Scorpio and the Xbox One of $200 or more is even greater than the delta between the PS4 Pro and the PS4 of $100 or more.""Microsoft is counting that consumers will look beyond the price tag and will see the value proposition of Xbox One X. The system is certainly loaded with bleeding edge tech.Developers will have 12 GB of RAM at their disposal and the system boasts advanced CPU and graphics chips. To buy or build a PC with those sorts of specs would likely cost well over the Xbox One X's cost of $499.Beyond the hardware, the system marks Microsoft's push into 4K gaming, emphasizing the graphical appeal of modern video games.Microsoft has pointedly avoided using the term ""next generation"" in describing Xbox One X, but the company has been clear in recent interviews that it believes the days of the industry launching dramatically different systems every 5-to-8 years is over.Analysts say they expect Microsoft to adopt a more PC-focused upgrade cycle – and Xbox One X is the first step in that.""The historical [console] cycle, as we understand it, is certainly gone,"" says P.J. McNealy of Digital World Research. ""Now it's more evolutionary. You can come out with another box that has a better CPU or GPU or bigger hard drive, or can now progress to 4K.

450,2019-01-10T14:37:39-0500,"Analysis: Apple has continued to ratchet up its criticism of competitors in a bid to differentiate itself as the ""most secure"" tech company.The move is a risky one, as Apple is exposed on several fronts to possible privacy and security leaks and breaches, putting it one step removed from a significant reputation dent that could further hurt sales. Apple ramped up its efforts this week to differentiate its business on the basis of privacy and security, a risky move given risks to its cloud-based backup service and a challenging privacy environment globally, particularly in China, where the company says it is struggling.Apple took a high-profile swipe at Google, Amazon and Facebook at this year's Computer Electronics Show, with a full-building ad touting ""What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone."" CEO Tim Cook has criticized competitors for their privacy practices and their willingness to share data with third parties.Apple is now also reportedly hiring ex-Facebook engineer Sandy Parakilas, who called Facebook a ""living, breathing crime scene"" because of its misuse by Russian hackers in the 2016 election. (Parakilas is reportedly taking an internal spot as a privacy product manager at Apple, a role not likely to include public-facing statements like these in the future).For sure, Apple's core business is different from Facebook's and Google's. Apple makes the bulk of its money selling iPhones and other computing devices, and charging consumer subscriptions for things like Apple Music. That means Apple has little reason to compile detailed information about users, and even less incentive to sell that information to third parties. But Facebook and Google make the vast majority of their money from advertising.But putting such a big stake in privacy as a differentiator may be a risky business move.First, Apple is just one iCloud breach away from an embarrassing incident that could damage its ""what happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone"" claims.Scandals in the past years involving major celebrities who have had nude photographs stolen from their iCloud archives have been dangerously close. Apple has said these incidents involved username and password theft, giving criminals access to iCloud files through the celebrities' password information, not a breached iCloud database.But iCloud relies on the same cloud-based network architecture most companies rely on, including Amazon Web Services, Google's cloud platform and Microsoft Azure. No database is impenetrable, and that includes those iCloud uses. A single instance of leaked data or an insider theft could put the company at serious reputational risk.Third-party applications are also a potential sticking point. From a security point of view, Apple's app store has stringent safeguards in place that make it more resilient to security issues like application spoofing than competitors such as Google's Play store.But independent iPhone apps still have the capacity to misuse data. The company routinely removes applications from the store for providing user information to unauthorized third parties. The New York Times reported earlier this year that numerous free iOS apps track detailed user information and provide it to third parties.So Apple may also be one data-tracking scandal away from significantly denting the idea that data necessarily ""stays on your iPhone."""
451,2012-11-02T17:34:00-0400,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Two weeks before a high-stakes trial pitting Google's Motorola Mobility unit against Microsoft, Google made what has become a common request for a technology company fighting for billions of dollars: A public court proceeding, conducted largely in secret.Google and Microsoft, like rivals embroiled in smartphone patent wars, are eager to keep sensitive business information under wraps - in this case, the royalty deals they cut with other companies on patented technology. Microsoft asked for similar protections in a court filing late on Thursday.Such royalty rates, though, are the central issue in this trial, which begins Nov. 13 in Seattle.U.S. District Judge James Robart has granted requests to block many pre-trial legal briefs from public view. Though he warned he may get tougher on the issue, the nature of the case raises the possibility that even his final decision might include redacted, or blacked-out, sections.Legal experts are increasingly troubled by the level of secrecy that has become commonplace in intellectual property cases where overburdened judges often pay scant attention to the issue.Widespread sealing of documents infringes on the basic American legal principle that court should be public, says law professor, Dennis Crouch, and encourages companies to use a costly, tax-payer funded resource to resolve their disputes.``There are plenty of cases that have settled because one party didn't want their information public,'' said Crouch, an intellectual property professor at University of Missouri School of Law.Tech companies counter that they should not be forced to reveal private business information as the price for having their day in court.The law does permit confidential information to be kept from public view in some circumstances, though companies must show the disclosure would be harmful.Google argues that revelations about licensing negotiations would give competitors ``additional leverage and bargaining power and would lead to an unfair advantage.''Robart has not yet ruled on Google and Microsoft's requests, which, in the case of Google includes not only keeping documents under seal, but also clearing the courtroom during crucial testimony.It is also unclear whether Robart will redact any discussion of royalty rates in his final opinion. The judge, who will decide this part of the case without a jury, did not respond to requests for comment.NOT PAYING ATTENTIONApple Inc and Microsoft Corp have been litigating in courts around the world against Google Inc and partners like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , which use the Android operating system on their mobile devices.Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS smartphone software, and Microsoft holds patents that it contends cover a number of Android features.Google bought Motorola for $12.5 billion, partly to use its large portfolio of communications patents as a bargaining chip against its competitors.Robart will decide how big a royalty Motorola deserves from Microsoft for a license on some Motorola wireless and video patents.Apple, for its part, is set to square off against Motorola on Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, in a case that involves many of the same issues.In Wisconsin, Apple and Motorola have filed most court documents entirely under seal. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb did not require them to seek advance permission to file them secretly, nor did she mandate that the companies make redacted copies available for the public.Judges have broad discretion in granting requests to seal documents. The legal standard for such requests can be high, but in cases where both sides want the proceedings to be secret, judges have little incentive to thoroughly review secrecy requests.In Apple's Northern California litigation against Samsung, both parties also sought to keep many documents under seal. After Reuters challenged those secrecy requests, on grounds it wanted to report financial details, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ordered both companies to disclose a range of information they considered secret - including profit margins on individual products - but not licensing deals. Apple and Samsung are appealing the disclosure order.In response to questions from Reuters last week, Judge Crabb in Wisconsin, who will also decide the case without a jury, acknowledged she had not been paying attention to how many documents were being filed under seal. Federal judges in Madison will now require that parties file redacted briefs, she said, though as of Wednesday, Apple and Motorola were still filing key briefs entirely under seal.``Just because there is a seed or kernel of confidential information doesn't mean an entire 25-page brief should be sealed,'' said Bernard Chao, an intellectual property professor at University of Denver Sturm College of Law.Crabb promised that the upcoming trial would be open.``Whatever opinion I make is not going to be redacted,'' she told Reuters in an interview.CHECKING THE COMPSMicrosoft sued Motorola two years ago, saying Motorola had promised to license its so-called ``standards essential'' patents at a fair rate, in exchange for the technology being adopted as a norm industrywide. But by demanding roughly $4 billion a year in revenue, Microsoft says Motorola broke its promise.Robart will sort out what a reasonable royalty for those standards patents should be, partly by reviewing deals Motorola struck with other companies such as IBM and Research in Motion - much like an appraiser checking comparable properties to figure out whether a home is priced right.In this case, though, the public may not be able to understand exactly what figures Robart is comparing. Representatives for Microsoft and Google declined to comment.In its brief, Microsoft said licensing terms could be sealed without the need to clear the courtroom.``Permitting redaction of this information will minimize the harm to Microsoft and third parties while also giving due consideration to the public policies favoring disclosure,'' the company argued.IBM and RIM have also asked Robart to keep licensing information secret.Chao doesn't think Robart will ultimately redact his own ruling, even though it may include discussion of the specific royalty rates. ``I can't imagine that,'' he said.Most judges cite lack of resources and overflowing dockets as the reason why they don't scrutinize secrecy requests more closely, especially when both parties support them.In Wisconsin, Crabb said that even though she will now require litigants to ask permission to file secret documents, it is highly unlikely that she will actually read those arguments - unless someone else flags a problem.``We're paddling madly to stay afloat,'' Crabb said.The Wisconsin case in U.S. District Court, Western District of Wisconsin is Apple Inc. vs. Motorola Mobility Inc., 11-cv-178.

453,2012-11-01T19:45:00-0400,"* Developer meeting in Seattle draws 2,000* Ballmer sells Windows, Windows Phone as app vehicles* Reaction mostly positive, doubters remainSEATTLE, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Days after launching Windows 8, Microsoft Corp is mounting a strong campaign to win over the software developers it needs to kick-start its new operating system.A lack of apps is Microsoft's Achilles heel as it attempts to catch Apple Inc and Google Inc in the rush toward mobile computing.Windows 8, the new Surface tablet and a range of Windows-based phones - all unveiled in the past week - are designed to close that gap, but the world's largest software company still needs to convince developers to recreate the thriving 'ecosystem' that made PCs so successful.``Please go out and write lots of applications,'' Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer pleaded with 2,000 developers on Tuesday, kicking off an annual, four-day meeting at its campus near Seattle.The event, called 'Build,' is the equivalent of Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference and Google's I/O event.Microsoft gave each paying attendee one of its Surface tablets and 100 gigabytes of free space on its SkyDrive online storage service. On top of that, handset partner Nokia threw in a free Lumia 920 smartphone running Windows Phone 8.The unprecedentedly generous give-away signals the intent of what Microsoft openly calls ``evangelism.'' Most developers at the meeting, who paid up to $2,000 to attend, are already converted to the Windows religion. But this year there is a feeling that Microsoft can re-establish itself as a relevant platform for developers.``The sessions are overflowing. Everybody wants to learn,'' said Greg Lutz, product manager at development tools company ComponentOne, who is attending the conference.``The Surface is really exciting. It's been interesting to see people that would normally be critics of Microsoft surprised to see how good it is,'' said Lutz, whose company makes features that developers can use in apps, such as calendars or charts.Microsoft recognizes it needs apps to flesh out its new online Windows Store and make Windows 8 machines more attractive to users, said Russ Whitman, chief strategy officer at Ratio Interactive, a design agency that helps companies create apps.``The catalog (of apps) is where they are weak, there's no doubt,'' he said. ``But if Microsoft stays focused on quality not quantity, they can win.''DEVELOPER DOUBTSWhen Windows 8 launched on Friday, some major content providers had prominent apps in the Windows store, such as Netflix Inc, the New York Times and Rovio's Angry Birds Space. But big names such as Facebook and Twitter were missing.Twitter moved to rectify that on Tuesday, announcing that a native Windows app would be rolled out ``in the months ahead.'' Dropbox, a fast-growing cloud storage service, also announced it would soon have a Windows app, as did online payment firm PayPal and sports network ESPN.But Facebook, which now has more than 1 billion users, has not yet made public any plans for a Windows app, despite the fact Microsoft is a minor shareholder.And Microsoft still has to overcome indifference from many developers who do not see demand from users or simply do not have the resources to build Windows apps alongside iOS and Android.``Windows 8 is getting good reviews and the tile user interface is a great fit with our geo-visual content,'' said Jason Karas, CEO at website Trover, where users can share photos of interesting discoveries. ``It's on the roadmap for Trover, but we are still a very lean team, so we're hesitant to support a third platform until we have all the innovations we want to see in iPhone and Android in place.''Microsoft has yet to persuade other influential online services, for example car-rental firm Zipcar or real estate information firm Zillow, to develop for Windows 8.To get more developers on board, Microsoft is spending this week demonstrating how it is making it easier to develop apps for Windows and get them into the real world.A key part of that is a new set of tools tying in its Azure cloud service, which allows Windows apps to easily harness data stored in remote servers.``Some of the new changes are pretty incredible and are going to make developing, especially some of the mobile apps, much easier,'' said Mike Cousins, a software developer following the conference by webcast from Calgary, Canada.``It just makes it super-easy to integrate mobile clients into your application,'' said Cousins, who is developing Shuttr, a site for photographers to display and sell their work. ``It's been reduced from probably a week's work to minutes.''400 MILLION NEW MACHINESMicrosoft's best argument to developers is the sheer size of the Windows user base.Microsoft sold 4 million upgrades to Windows 8 in its first four days, a mere fraction of the 670 million or so machines running Windows 7. Ballmer said there would be 400 million new devices running Windows next year, including PCs, tablets and phones, and the company would be marketing heavily to consumers.That is an attractive audience for developers, and Whitman at Ratio Interactive said he saw many new faces at Microsoft's event this week who previously were more interested in web-based apps and other platforms.``There's a new generation of developers that can build on Windows 8 that have been building using JavaScript and HTML,'' he said. ``Seeing some of those developers show up and talk about building apps using other languages is pretty cool. It's a whole different group than Microsoft has traditionally been able to court.''One Wall Street analyst said developers may even be tempted to switch back to Microsoft after working with Apple's iOS platform.``There does seem to be some excitement about the new operating system and many of the new devices that are coming to market,'' said Jason Maynard, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. ``We have heard some developers talk about 're-Microsofting' and moving from their Macs for app development.''Cousins said that once developers see the user base for Windows 8 grow, the momentum will start to have an effect.``All the new PCs people buy will be Windows 8, and people will start demanding Windows 8 apps from companies, and then they will start making them,'' he said. ``I think we'll see a wave of apps coming out pretty soon.''"
454,2012-11-02T18:26:00-0400,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Two weeks before a high-stakes trial pitting Google's Motorola Mobility unit against Microsoft, Google made what has become a common request for a technology company fighting for billions of dollars: A public court proceeding, conducted largely in secret.Google and Microsoft, like rivals embroiled in smartphone patent wars, are eager to keep sensitive business information under wraps - in this case, the royalty deals they cut with other companies on patented technology. Microsoft asked for similar protections in a court filing late on Thursday.Such royalty rates, though, are the central issue in this trial, which begins Nov. 13 in Seattle.U.S. District Judge James Robart has granted requests to block many pre-trial legal briefs from public view. Though he warned he may get tougher on the issue, the nature of the case raises the possibility that even his final decision might include redacted, or blacked-out, sections.Legal experts are increasingly troubled by the level of secrecy that has become commonplace in intellectual property cases where overburdened judges often pay scant attention to the issue.Widespread sealing of documents infringes on the basic American legal principle that court should be public, and encourages companies to use a costly, taxpayer-funded resource to resolve their disputes, says law professor Dennis Crouch.``There are plenty of cases that have settled because one party didn't want their information public,'' said Crouch, an intellectual property professor at University of Missouri School of Law.Tech companies counter that they should not be forced to reveal private business information as the price for having their day in court.The law does permit confidential information to be kept from public view in some circumstances, though companies must show the disclosure would be harmful.Google argues that revelations about licensing negotiations would give competitors ``additional leverage and bargaining power and would lead to an unfair advantage.''Robart has not yet ruled on Google and Microsoft's requests, which, in the case of Google includes not only keeping documents under seal, but also clearing the courtroom during crucial testimony.It is also unclear whether Robart will redact any discussion of royalty rates in his final opinion. The judge, who will decide this part of the case without a jury, did not respond to requests for comment.NOT PAYING ATTENTIONApple Inc and Microsoft Corp have been litigating in courts around the world against Google Inc and partners like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , which use the Android operating system on their mobile devices.Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS smartphone software, and Microsoft holds patents that it contends cover a number of Android features.Google bought Motorola for $12.5 billion, partly to use its large portfolio of communications patents as a bargaining chip against its competitors.Robart will decide how big a royalty Motorola deserves from Microsoft for a license on some Motorola wireless and video patents.Apple, for its part, is set to square off against Motorola on Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, in a case that involves many of the same issues.In Wisconsin, Apple and Motorola have filed most court documents entirely under seal. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb did not require them to seek advance permission to file them secretly, nor did she mandate that the companies make redacted copies available for the public.Judges have broad discretion in granting requests to seal documents. The legal standard for such requests can be high, but in cases where both sides want the proceedings to be secret, judges have little incentive to thoroughly review secrecy requests.In Apple's Northern California litigation against Samsung, both parties also sought to keep many documents under seal. After Reuters challenged those secrecy requests, on grounds it wanted to report financial details, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ordered both companies to disclose a range of information they considered secret - including profit margins on individual products - but not licensing deals. Apple and Samsung are appealing the disclosure order.In response to questions from Reuters last week, Judge Crabb in Wisconsin, who will also decide the case without a jury, acknowledged she had not been paying attention to how many documents were being filed under seal. Federal judges in Madison will now require that parties file redacted briefs, she said, though as of Wednesday, Apple and Motorola were still filing key briefs entirely under seal.``Just because there is a seed or kernel of confidential information doesn't mean an entire 25-page brief should be sealed,'' said Bernard Chao, an intellectual property professor at University of Denver Sturm College of Law.Crabb promised that the upcoming trial would be open.``Whatever opinion I make is not going to be redacted,'' she told Reuters in an interview.CHECKING THE COMPSMicrosoft sued Motorola two years ago, saying Motorola had promised to license its so-called ``standards essential'' patents at a fair rate, in exchange for the technology being adopted as a norm industrywide. But by demanding roughly $4 billion a year in revenue, Microsoft says Motorola broke its promise.Robart will sort out what a reasonable royalty for those standards patents should be, partly by reviewing deals Motorola struck with other companies such as IBM and Research in Motion - much like an appraiser checking comparable properties to figure out whether a home is priced right.In this case, though, the public may not be able to understand exactly what figures Robart is comparing. Representatives for Microsoft and Google declined to comment.In its brief, Microsoft said licensing terms could be sealed without the need to clear the courtroom.``Permitting redaction of this information will minimize the harm to Microsoft and third parties while also giving due consideration to the public policies favoring disclosure,'' the company argued.IBM and RIM have also asked Robart to keep licensing information secret.Chao doesn't think Robart will ultimately redact his own ruling, even though it may include discussion of the specific royalty rates. ``I can't imagine that,'' he said.Most judges cite lack of resources and overflowing dockets as the reason why they don't scrutinize secrecy requests more closely, especially when both parties support them.In Wisconsin, Crabb said that even though she will now require litigants to ask permission to file secret documents, it is highly unlikely that she will actually read those arguments - unless someone else flags a problem.``We're paddling madly to stay afloat,'' Crabb said.The Wisconsin case in U.S. District Court, Western District of Wisconsin is Apple Inc. vs. Motorola Mobility Inc., 11-cv-178. The Seattle case in U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823."
455,2019-01-07T18:50:39-0500,"Samsung Electronics said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter earnings likely decreased sharply due to lackluster demand in its memory chip business as well growing competition in the smartphone segment.The South Korean tech giant predicted operating profit for the three months ended December was approximately 10.8 trillion Korean won ($9.67 billion). That was 28.71 percent down from a year ago and 18.18 percent less than the 13.2 trillion won analysts had predicted.Samsung Electronics said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter earnings likely decreased sharply due to lackluster demand in its memory chip business as well growing competition in the smartphone segment.The South Korean tech giant predicted operating profit for the three months ended December was approximately 10.8 trillion Korean won ($9.67 billion) — or 28.71 percent down from a year ago.The figure missed market expectations, coming in 18.18 percent less than the 13.2 trillion won that analysts had predicted after factoring in the weakness in the semiconductor market. The expected average was already significantly lower than Samsung's third-quarter operating profit of 17.57 trillion won and below the 14.87 trillion netted in the June quarter.Consolidated sales for the fourth-quarter is predicted to be around 59 trillion won, lower than the 62.8 trillion won analysts predicted in a Reuters poll, and 10.57 percent down from a year ago.The chipmaker said weaker-than-expected demand for memory chips from data center customers led to a decline in shipments and a notable drop in memory chip prices.""What's happening is that memory demand has really fallen off a cliff in (the fourth quarter),"" Mark Newman, managing director at Sanford C. Bernstein, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Tuesday. He said that much of the weakness in the predicted numbers is due to ""data center demand being pushed down, and also smartphone's (demand is) pretty weak.""Newman explained that data center companies that buy memory chips from Samsung and other chipmakers, have slowed down their orders in the last few months — the slowdown was a major driver of the magnitude of Samsung's profit miss, he said.""That's following about 24 months of very, very aggressive growth,"" he said. ""So, suddenly, what's happened is data center companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google ... these companies suddenly have enough memory, and they stopped ordering. And that has really been one of the major stumbling blocks for these memory companies.""Still, he said, there's also a lot of broad-based weakness in overall demand for technology — and much of it is in China. Samsung said marketing expenses and flat sales volumes led to a decline in profitability in a ""stagnant and fiercely competitive market"" in the smartphone business. Over the third quarter of 2018, Samsung saw more than 13 percent year-over-year decline in global smartphone shipments, according to International Data Corporation.Samsung shares were volatile on that news, trading between positive and negative territory in the morning.Analysts have said that smartphones from various companies have become so similar in their features and functionality, that customers no longer see tangible differences — the devices are not as innovative as they used to be. The prediction is that a new generation of high-speed mobile internet could shake things up for the industry.For its part, Samsung said it will focus on technological innovations that include foldable smartphones and devices that can support a new generation of high-speed internet connections.Samsung will disclose detailed earnings later in the month but added that difficult business conditions for the memory business would likely keep its earnings subdued for the first quarter of 2019. It expects the memory business to improve in the second half of the calendar.The weakness predicted in fourth-quarter earnings was not wholly unexpected, according to Mehdi Hosseini, senior tech hardware analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group.""When you're looking at a company like Samsung Electronics, they have a very expensive operation,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" referring to the notable miss in predicted profits announced by the company.""They have semiconductor manufacturing that has a significant overhead cost. So, when revenue and shipment decline below certain targets, you have a significant margin pressure,"" Hosseini said, adding it explains the miss in Samsung's operating profit number.The weak guidance from Samsung comes after Apple lowered its revenue and gross margin predictions last week, citing a weakening Chinese economy and lower-than-expected iPhone revenue in Greater China as some of the factors.Concerns over a slowdown in the Chinese economy have kept investors on edge. It could pose a worry for Samsung since it sells memory chips used in smartphones and data centers to Chinese firms. At the same time, it also has production plants in the world's second-largest economy for some of the memory chips — those are likely to be hurt by the ongoing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.In December, a report from the Korea International Trade Association said the trade war may pose higher risks to both Samsung and its chipmaking rival SK Hynix.At the same time, a slowdown in Chinese consumer demand could potentially affect Samsung's consumer electronics business, including smartphones. One analyst said that China accounts for between 20 to 30 percent of global consumer tech demand.Hosseini said that he does not expect Samsung's fundamentals to improve in the March quarter — the weakness may even extended into the quarter ending June 2019.""You can argue that there could be a rebound in the second half but the slope of the recovery, or how bad fundamentals are going to look like in March or June quarter, is not really clear,"" he said.For his part, Newman said that while things are likely to improve in the later half of the year, it's still ""too early"" to get confidence that there's going to be a rebound in Samsung's memory business.""What we can see, and what the company is also saying, is that demand is going to improve in the second half. And in addition to that memory supply is being pushed out,"" he said, adding that the oversupply in the market is expected to ease and could help improve the business condition.""Whether there'll be a steep rebound, I think it's really too early to tell at this point but it should improve somewhat,"" Newman said."
456,2012-10-24T14:42:00-0400,"Oct 24 (Reuters) - Tech bloggers and other reviewers praised Microsoft Corp's new Surface RT tablet for beautiful design but said a shortage of applications and a slow operating system meant the result was heartbreak for users.Microsoft begins selling the Surface on Friday, joining the fight in a tablet market dominated by Apple Inc's iPads and devices using Google Inc's Android system.Reviewers given the product early to play with it said its first version paled in comparison with the iPad.Matt Burns of TechCrunch said the tablet was great and the Windows RT operating system showed promise, but he still was not keen.``There are simply more mature options available right now,'' he wrote. ()Similarly, Sam Biddle of Gizmodo, a technology website, said Surface had fantastic potential but he was sharply critical of the operating system, Windows RT, saying it was underpowered, lacked functionality.``While potential is worth your attention, it's not worth your paycheck. Surface RT gets so many things right, and pulls so many good things together into one package. But it is undercooked,'' he wrote. ()Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system, also available on tablets, had the full range of Windows apps but Windows RT does not, and lacks compatibility with older software, Vincent Nguyen at Slashgear said. ()``Microsoft hasn't done the best job explaining the differences, and many consumers are likely to buy RT only to find out they don't have the full functionality of Windows 8,'' added CNET's Shara Tibken. ()Microsoft has said it expects to have 100,000 apps in place for the tablet by January, whereas Apple has 275,000 iPad apps available now and its tablet also runs many more iPhone apps.``Microsoft says there will be thousands of apps at launch, with a constant stream of more coming, but its apps offerings pale next to the number Apple has made available for the iPad,'' Edward Baig at USA Today wrote. ()Wall Street Journal's Walt Mossberg praised the availability of Microsoft Office apps and optional keyboards.``If you can live with its tiny number of third-party apps, and somewhat disappointing battery life, it may give you the productivity some miss in other tablets,'' he said. ()But Wired reviewer Mathew Honan warned that the tablet would not turn heads.``Nobody asked me about my Surface. I tried flashing it all over the place. But despite my best efforts, no one seemed curious,'' Honan wrote. ()``The only person to comment on it was a TSA agent at the Seattle airport, who told me I didn't need to take my iPad out of my bag.''"

A couple of my in-the-know sources are predicting that Microsoft will buy Yahoo. And then of course there's speculation that Yahoo might combine with eBay .But let's talk about News Corp. talking about swapping MySpace for 25% of Yahoo--which CNBC's David Faber was first to report on Monday. What would that loss mean for News Corp.? And what does it say about the fast-changing fates on the web? Does is really all come down to the fact that Facebook is so hot right now? It might. Rupert Murdoch got MySpace for a steal--$580 million in 2005--and has since been lauded for the brilliant move, growing the site and leveraging it with his other properties. Now MySpace has been valued at some $10 billion dollars, never mind its value as a marketing tool for everything from 20th Century Fox movies to Fox TV shows. Two weeks ago, Murdoch was quoted in the Wall Street Journal, sounding envious of the next Internet darling. Murdoch said one of the reasons he wasn't interested in The Tribune company was the decline in readership. ""WSJ: They're all going to MySpace. Murdoch: I wish they were. They're all going to Facebook at the moment. (Note: correction from earlier post on time of interview from last week to two weeks ago.)Murdoch may regret putting his money on the early leader in the race. MySpace created the social networking space, Facebook swooped in later with a hotter niche and now it has all the buzz. Now Murdoch is facing a similar issue with Yahoo. Yahoo had all the early buzz, but has since been far surpassed by Google . It's the fact that Yahoo was that early leader and has fallen so far that gives it such an appealing price. But the question then is what would Murdoch want to do with it? Turn it into an information portal, as Semel was pushing? Would marrying the two brands help Yahoo? Or will it only further dilute MySpace? And would News Corp. lose the access to MySpace as a crucial tool? Oh, and would the folks at Yahoo even want Murdoch as such a a large, opinionated shareholder? And this isn't just about the Internet. Could this impact Murdoch's bid for Dow Jones ? There certainly would be a lot of simultaneous changes should both go forward. ""Questions?  Comments?  MediaMoney@cnbc.com"

Ballmer thinks Satya Nadella has done a great job leading Microsoft in the past three years. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said during an interview on Tuesday that he thinks the technology company's stock didn't have an opportunity to fluctuate when he was in charge.""Frankly I don't think the stock price had a chance to move while I was CEO,"" Ballmer told CNBC's Jon Fortt in the interview, which aired on CNBC's Squawk Alley on Wednesday.Ballmer was being humble; the stock price did see a considerable rise between 2009 and 2014, following a dive during the economic recession. That said, Microsoft's stock price has continued to go up under Ballmer's successor, Satya Nadella, who took over in February 2014. Ballmer said he thought Microsoft did do its part to drive up earnings, specifically producing profits. ""That's our controllable,"" he said. ""The stock price is not a controllable.""Nadella has been doing an excellent job as Microsoft's CEO, he said.Ballmer said he thought it was good that he stayed on the company's board when Nadella took over but then left the board when he bought the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team a few months later.""I've only been back on the Microsoft campus once, I think, since I've retired,"" Ballmer said.Speaking onstage on Tuesday at Recode's Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., Ballmer had told Recode's Kara Swisher and Kurt Wagner that Microsoft did not do enough to develop hardware capability during his tenure. In the interview, Ballmer built on those comments, saying that under his leadership the company did make a big investment in the HoloLens augmented reality headset, which was released in 2015.""Whether it's Microsoft or the competition, that's certainly what I've seen happen, but I'm glad to see energy happen on the topic, because it is the frontier of innovation,"" Ballmer said.Facebook and Snap are among the companies incorporating AR features into their apps."

Microsoft contends that Google's Android infringes its software patents but so far has pursued handset makers rather than Google itself for payment of royalties.  Many hardware companies have settled with Microsoft over their use of Android, but Motorola -- which Google bought this year -- is fighting a range of patent issues with Microsoft in courts in the United States and Germany.  In the latest move, Microsoft said in a court in Munich that it plans to add Google as a defendant in a case in which it claims a mapping feature on Motorola phones infringes one of its patents.  ""It became necessary to add Google to this particular case because Motorola maintains that it lacks sufficient information about actions occurring on Google's servers,"" said a Microsoft spokesperson in an e-mailed statement on Friday.  Google signaled it would defend itself.    ""We want to focus on innovation, not litigation, but we'll vigorously defend against any amended complaint Microsoft files,"" Google's Deputy General Counsel Allen Lo said in an emailed statement.  The patent in question defines a method for a mobile device to obtain a map from one database, call up resource information such as the location of a hotel from a second database, and overlay the two sets of data.

Microsoft has not yet announced the price of the full software to install from scratch, as opposed to the upgrade. The current price for a comparable version of Windows 7 is $200.  Any customer who buys, or already bought, a Windows 7 PC between June 2 and the end of January 2013 will be able to get an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro for $15, a move designed to prevent a drop-off in PC sales before the launch of Windows 8.  Microsoft also said PC makers such as Acer , Asustek , Dell , HP , Samsung and Sony were also now taking pre-orders for machines with Windows 8 pre-installed.    The world's largest software company did not mention its own Surface tablet PC, which is expected on the market at the same time as Windows 8.

464,2012-10-09T20:24:00-0400,"* CEO Ballmer sees future in hardware, online services  * Ballmer says will build 'specific devices' when required  * Takes cut in bonus after flat year for Windows(Recasts, adds Ballmer quotes on strategy, background)  By Bill Rigby    SEATTLE, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has signaled a new direction for the world's largest software company, pointing to hardware and online services as its future, taking a page from long-time rival Apple Inc .  Ballmer's comments in his annual letter to shareholders published on Tuesday suggested that Microsoft may eventually make its own phones to build on its forthcoming own-brand Surface tablet PC and market-leading Xbox gaming console.  ""There will be times when we build specific devices for specific purposes, as we have chosen to do with Xbox and the recently announced Microsoft Surface,"" wrote Ballmer.  The new approach mimics Apple Inc , whose massively successful iPhone and iPad demonstrated tight integration of high-quality software and hardware and made Windows devices feel clunky in comparison.  Ballmer, who took over as CEO from co-founder Bill Gates in 2000, said the company would continue to work with its traditional hardware partners, such as Dell Inc , Samsung and HTC , but he made it clear that Microsoft's role in the so-called 'ecosystem' was changing.    ""It impacts how we run the company, how we develop new experiences, and how we take products to market for both consumers and businesses,"" he wrote.  Microsoft already makes money from providing services online, such as access to servers to enable 'cloud computing', or Web versions of its Office applications, but Ballmer's new emphasis suggests an acceleration away from its traditional business model of selling installed software.  ""This is a significant shift, both in what we do and how we see ourselves - as a devices and services company,"" he added.  BONUS CLIPPED    Alongside the shareholders' letter, Microsoft's annual proxy filing, which deals with the shareholders' meeting and other governance issues, showed that Ballmer, 56, got a lower bonus than he did last year, partly for flat sales of Windows and his failure to ensure that the company provided a choice of browser to some European customers.  He earned a bonus of $620,000 for Microsoft's 2012 fiscal year, which ended in June, down 9 percent from the year before, according to documents filed on Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  His salary, which is low by U.S. standards for chief executives, remained essentially flat at $685,000.  It is the third year in a row that Ballmer has not earned his maximum bonus, set at twice his salary.  Microsoft's recent financial year was scarred by a $6.2 billion write-down for a failed acquisition and lower profit from its flagship Windows system as computer sales stood still.  In the company's filing, Microsoft's compensation committee said it took into account a 3 percent decline in Windows sales over the year, as well as ""the Windows division failure to provide a browser choice screen on certain Windows PCs in Europe as required by its 2009 commitment with the European Commission.""  Microsoft's failure to provide a browser choice in Europe was an embarrassing setback for the company, which has been embroiled in disputes with European regulators for more than a decade and paid more than $1 billion in fines for including its own Internet Explorer browser on Windows. It now faces further fines from a new investigation.  Separately, Microsoft said that independent lead director Reed Hastings, the CEO of online video rental company Netflix, would not seek reelection at the shareholder meeting in November. A new lead director will be chosen at the meeting, Microsoft said. Hastings, 51, said he wanted to focus on Netflix and his education work.(Reporting By Bill Rigby; Editing by M.D. Golan)((bill.rigby@thomsonreuters.com)(+1 206 418 9236)(Reuters Messaging: bill.rigby.reuters.com@reuters.net))Keywords: MICROSOFT BALLMER/"

466,2017-05-29T23:03:28-0400,"HYDERABAD, India — Voice-powered virtual assistants, underpinned by artificial intelligence, like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana are becoming regular fixtures in people's lives. They're present at homes, on devices and watches and in cars, sending driving directions, weather updates, meeting reminders and the occasional joke or two when prompted.Beyond that, they remain limited in their ability to hold conversations with users, the same way real people might. Efforts are on, however, to use machine learning and real-time big data analytics to make virtual assistants understand multiple languages, accents, contexts and nuances to hold more human-like conversations. International Data Corporation predicts global spending on cognitive and AI solutions will see significant investments over the next several years, and could achieve a compound annual growth rate of 54.4 percent through 2020.Microsoft, for example, is turning to an unlikely group to bridge the gap between human-machine interactions: bilinguals. Of specific interest is the practice of code-mixing, which is when speakers switch back and forth between multiple languages in a single sentence or conversation. It's commonly found in multilingual societies. A handful of Microsoft researchers in India started Project Mélange, where they are studying the use of code-mixing among Indians online. They are trying to figure out how virtual assistants might be taught to respond to a user switching between, for example, English and Hindi in a conversation.""Compartmentalization of mixed languages (by multilinguals) have gone away with each coming generation,"" Kalika Bali, a researcher at Microsoft, told CNBC in an interview. ""So younger people use mixed languages in more and more phases of their lives.""""To have a digital assistant, something like Cortana, you have to be able to understand (the user base),"" she said, adding current systems weren't trained to pick up multiple languages in a single conversation.Microsoft's philosophy is that virtual assistants should not be too intrusive on a user's space and time, and only show up when they need to, Sundar Srinivasan, general manager of the AI division in India at Microsoft, said in a recent interview. Srinivasan's team works on Cortana and Microsoft's search engine Bing at the company's development center in Hyderabad.""A personal assistant is only as effective as you want her to be,"" he said.Cortana is available on Windows 10 and in selected smartphones running on the Windows operating software. It has about 140 million monthly active users versus about 500 million devices currently running Windows 10. The program is not available in many regions, but Srinivasan said Microsoft plans to expand it into other markets and onto more devices in the future.By comparison, Google Assistant is available on both Android and iOS platforms, which support about 99.8 percent of all smartphones in the world.Srinivasan explained that Cortana was not like other Microsoft products such as Office, where the company could add features as and when needed. Instead, Cortana ""needs to really understand human beings, and the bar for that is very high because that means we have to train the assistant with lots of human speech data,"" he said.""It's going to take us time.""Bali said the researchers' code-mixing study was inspired by observations from an anthropologist who was looking at the use of technology among Urdu-speaking youth in Hyderabadi slums. They were found using the internet to befriend and interact with girls from Brazil, who primarily spoke Portuguese. English, however, was the primary language for that communication, which piqued Bali's interest and she had asked to see the data collected by the anthropologist.""When I started seeing this data, I saw that not only were they using this very pidgin English kind of thing, but (they were) effectively communicating with each other,"" Bali said, referring to the type of code-mixing that was happening in these conversations.The team looks at every aspect of code-mixing, including text, speech, understanding and recognition. Bali said they also look at generational variations and why people switch between languages in a single conversation — for example, sometimes it's for humor and at other times it's to change topics.But it may take years before a voice-powered virtual assistant can eloquently switch back and forth in multiple languages to respond to users. The biggest challenge now for Bali and the researchers is getting access to adequate data sets for study.""Trying to solve just mono-lingual natural language processing and understanding has taken years. Now we're talking about mixed stuff and where are we going to get data from?"" Bali said. ""Because everything is data-driven. And what are we going to do? It just seemed like a very difficult problem to solve but we were all so excited about this that we just went on.""Currently, the team uses data collected from Twitter to study how users would switch between languages. Studies, Bali said, already showed Indian men who spoke English and Hindi tended to switch to the latter when they had to express negative sentiments or abuse. Women who are having a conversation in English, however, tended to stick with that language even when the content took a negative turn.Teaching machines to interpret code-mixing could also potentially lead to developments in areas of opinion mining, customization and a better interpretation of nuances and context, Bali said.""I think this would definitely help to bridge the gap in the human-computer interaction. The fact that you can actually talk to a machine the way you would normally talk to your friend is something we still need to wrap our heads around."""
467,2012-10-12T15:44:00-0400,"SEATTLE, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Friday it plans to add Google Inc as a defendant in Germany in one of its patent actions against Google's phone maker, Motorola Mobility, marking the first time the two tech giants have come into direct legal conflict over Google's Android mobile software.  Microsoft contends that Google's Android infringes its software patents but so far has pursued handset makers rather than Google itself for payment of royalties.  Many hardware companies have settled with Microsoft over their use of Android, but Motorola -- which Google bought this year -- is fighting a range of patent issues with Microsoft in courts in the United States and Germany.  In the latest move, Microsoft said in a court in Munich that it plans to add Google as a defendant in a case in which it claims a mapping feature on Motorola phones infringes one of its patents.  ""It became necessary to add Google to this particular case because Motorola maintains that it lacks sufficient information about actions occurring on Google's servers,"" said a Microsoft spokesperson in an e-mailed statement on Friday. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The patent in question defines a method for a mobile device to obtain a map from one database, call up resource information such as the location of a hotel from a second database, and overlay the two sets of data.  Motorola and Microsoft are engaged in separate patent disputes in courts in Mannheim, Germany and Seattle over Motorola's use of scheduling software and Microsoft's use of some video and wireless technology.(Reporting By Bill Rigby; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)((bill.rigby@thomsonreuters.com; +1 206 418 9236; Reuters Messaging: bill.rigby.reuters.com@reuters.net))Keywords: MICROSOFT MOTOROLA/"

Meanwhile, Miller's fund is ""off to a very strong start this year,"" after having a ""pretty bad"" 2018.Amazon's stock will double in the next three years, noted investor Bill Miller told CNBC on Monday.""Amazon's addressable market is so gigantic,"" said Miller, founder of Miller Value Partners and a longtime Amazon bull.The tech giant, up 2.77 percent in afternoon trading, is now the most valuable public company in the world. It overtook Microsoft on Monday morning after reaching a market value of about $790 billion. Microsoft's market value stands at about $785 billion. In September, Amazon reached a $1 trillion market cap for the first time before losing ground in the late-year sell-off.However, despite that sell-off, Amazon is still up 30 percent over the last 12 months, Miller told Kelly Evans on the new CNBC show ""The Exchange.""And while there has been a lot of talk about regulating tech companies, Miller is unconcerned about Amazon being broken up. For that to happen, antitrust laws would have to be changed and ""they can't agree on anything in Congress. That's a long way off, if it happens,"" he said.Meanwhile, Miller's fund, Miller Opportunity Trust, is ""off to a very strong start this year,"" after having a ""pretty bad"" 2018.He blamed last year's performance on the December rout, saying the sell-off ""really, really hit us.""""At the end of the third quarter, I think we were about 700 or 800 basis points ahead of the market,"" he said. ""We gave all that back and more in the fourth quarter.""Miller, a star money manager at Legg Mason for decades, is best known for beating the S&amp;P 500 for 15 consecutive years through 2005. His track record more recently, particularly during the financial crisis, has been up and down.In 2016, he went out on his own, forming Miller Value Partners.A year later, he bought two mutual funds that he started at Legg Mason. The bigger of the two, Miller Opportunity Trust, beat the S&amp;P 500 in 2017. But the fund trailed the index by about 6 percentage points last year.Stocks, in late Monday trading, were adding to Friday's massive gains of more than 3 percent for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500. The Nasdaq on Friday was up more than 4.2 percent. However, Monday's advance was not nearly enough to bring the Dow, S&amp;P and Nasdaq out of correction territory.The two-day rally came after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said the central bank would be ""flexible"" in its approach to monetary policy. Stronger-than-expected employment data also contributed to Friday's sharp gains.Disclaimer"

Microsoft's new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop products are about to hit the market next month, but they're going to be up against Apple's latest, too, which have historically gained high praise from consumers for reliability and support.In Consumer Reports' latest survey of 83,000 computer owners, the magazine found that Apple's notebook computers had the lowest ""broken or not working as well"" percentage (17 percent), according to ZDNet.ASUS came in dead last with 33 percent of laptops purchased between 2012 and 2016 falling into that same category. Samsung trailed Apple in second place (27 percent broken or not working) while Dell came in third (29 percent) followed by HP (30 percent) and Lenovo (31 percent.)The survey was published several months ago but Consumer Reports spokesperson Doug Love told CNBC on Friday: ""I can tell you that Apple regularly performs at the top of Consumer Reports' reliability surveys.""Consumers in the survey said just 15 percent of Apple's desktop computers were broken or not working well, again giving Apple the crown in that category.The survey also covered technical support and awarded Apple a score of 82, which meant readers were ""very satisfied"" with Apple support on average. Microsoft was the nearest with a rating of 68, meaning readers were ""fairly well-satisfied."" Microsoft will need to step up its game to keep new Surface owners pleased, especially in the tech support department.While Apple may be the winner among computers in that survey, a separate survey from J.D. Power published in April said the Microsoft Surface topped its tablet satisfaction study.Correction: This story was revised to clarify that the Consumer Reports survey on Apple was published several months ago."

472,2017-05-25T09:00:00-0400," Microsoft is adding co-streaming to the new Mixer app. Google's YouTube Gaming app has had mobile game streaming since 2015, and now Microsoft's competing app is getting that feature. Microsoft on Thursday is announcing a new name for Beam, the live streaming app that it acquired last year. Mixer, as it will be called now, is getting features that are available from other apps people use to stream games and other content.The rebrand comes three years after Amazon acquired Twitch.tv and almost two years after Google's YouTube launched the standalone YouTube Gaming app. Microsoft will replace Beam for Android and iOS with the Mixer app, and Mixer will take the place of Beam on the Xbox One and in Windows 10. Microsoft is making it possible for up to four people to simultaneously live stream themselves gaming or doing other things in Mixer. Viewers will see the screen divided up into four sections of all the people who are streaming.Initially this ""co-streaming"" feature will be available on Xbox One, for people participating in its Insiders program, and in Windows 10. Later it will come to mobile devices. It's possible to watch multiple streamers at once on Twitch, although doing so involves using additional software.Facebook earlier this week introduced a similar feature that lets you bring in a guest while live streaming.Additionally, Microsoft is releasing new Mixer Create mobile apps that will let users stream live. Soon Microsoft will update that app so as to enable game streaming as well. YouTube Gaming has permitted mobile streaming since 2015.Microsoft will show original programming and highlights from its users in a new always-on Channel One section of Mixer, too. Twitch provides some original programming.Beam was the most popular game streaming app on Xbox One last month, Mike Nichols, CMO for Xbox at Microsoft, told CNBC in an interview. Microsoft has not talked about how many users Beam has. Twitch has nearly 10 million daily active users."

The source declined to provide details on what a potential deal structure would look like. The source close to Microsoft said the company's preference all along has been to retain the original deal structure that would involve paying $31 per share in cash and stock to acquire Yahoo. But Microsoft has not ruled out bidding with partners. Earlier, the Wall Street Journal, which is owned by News Corp , reported that people close to Microsoft said the software maker plans to pursue Yahoo alone rather than with News Corp, which had held talks with Microsoft on a joint bid for Yahoo. The Journal also said Yahoo's board of directors met on Friday to assess their options, including deepening their negotiations with Time Warner Inc's AOL on a deal to merge Yahoo and AOL, but that no decisions were reached. Spokesmen for Microsoft, News Corp, Time Warnerand Yahoo were not immediately available to comment. The newspaper's Web site cited unnamed sources as saying that Time Warner had been expecting Yahoo's board to move closer to backing an AOL deal and that Yahoo's delays suggested that the company was hesitant to proceed. A source familiar with the situation was unwilling to confirm to Reuters the Journal's characterization of Time Warner's thinking, but said that talks continue between Time Warner and Yahoo. Microsoft had threatened last Saturday to launch a hostile bid for Yahoo and could lower its offer of $42.4 billion around April 26 if it does not get a deal. The New York Times reported on Wednesday that News Corp was in talks to join Microsoft's bid for the Web pioneer.

474,2017-05-24T14:22:35-0400," Robot start-ups and cloud providers are eyeing Trump's $1 trillion infrastructure plan. Robots can be used to inspect and repair aging infrastructure. But there is fierce competition. President Donald Trump has promised to unveil a $1 trillion infrastructure plan this year, a proposal that was in focus last week as Washington observed ""infrastructure week"" — even if it was overshadowed by a flurry of other political news.Trump's infrastructure plans, plus his promises of a manufacturing renaissance, are expected to be a boon for industries like transportation and engineering.But they could also benefit some less-expected sectors: robotics start-ups and the cloud companies that work with them. ""Compute and storage utilities, I think this is going to enable massive innovation by all sorts of companies, not the least of which are all the industrial companies that can lever and take advantage of the massive investments that Google's making, Amazon's making, Microsoft's making, and machine learning that's in the cloud,"" Altimeter Capital's Brad Gerstner told CNBC earlier this month.Building roads and bridges may seem outside the purview of big technology companies like Amazon and Google. But when an industrial company wants to make a model of, say, when a bridge will corrode, it can use data from the sensors on a robot, and send that data to be crunched in the cloud, said Ben Wolff, CEO of robotics company Sarcos.Sarcos is one company that thinks it can get a boost from the infrastructure and manufacturing boom.The Utah-based robotics company makes rugged machines that can explore areas where humans can't — or shouldn't — enter safely, like tunnels, pipes, corroding bridges and under automobiles. ""Every time we use the robot, it may be a different environment. Inspecting a bridge one day, a refinery tank, the welds inside a shipping container,"" Wolff said. ""In a nutshell, if the infrastructure plan goes forward it creates a lot of opportunity for Sarcos. One thing that will be critical is evaluating the useful life of some of the remaining infrastructure."" The Guardian S, one of Sarcos' robots, is a 13-pound snake-like all-terrain machine, powered remotely by human engineers. The Guardian XO, still in development, claims to be the world's first ""fully powered industrial exoskeleton,"" an ""Iron Man""-like suit that helps the wearer lift 200 pounds ""repeatedly without exertion, strain or injury."" Another factor in Sarcos' favor? The company isn't trying to replace human productivity: ""[W]e enhance it, by making you stronger, keeping you safer and getting you places you couldn't otherwise go,"" a description said. That's key, because central to Trump's promises are the jobs they will create. Last year, The New York Times asked Trump if bringing back manufacturing to the U.S. would push up costs and spur companies to turn to automation. ""It's a big thing, we'll make the robots, too,"" Trump said. ""Right now we don't make the robots. We don't make anything.""According to Wolff, Sarcos' robots are designed for unstructured environments, not the factory floor. But that also means that they're less likely to replace rote jobs.""Before the forklift or before the power drill, we had humans doing the work and they had to lift the heavy things on their own, and there was more danger involved,"" Wolff said. ""So I think we look at the robots as really the next level of innovation — tools in the workplace that enhance safety.""While Trump's plan has been criticized as dated, in some ways it couldn't be timed better for tech companies like Sarcos, and its partner, Microsoft.Wolff said advancements in critical technologies like cloud computing and machine learning, the falling prices of computer vision sensors, and the smaller, faster chips and batteries on the market have created an opportunity for industrial companies to leverage robots in a way they could not have done even five years ago. ""I call this the golden age of robotics,"" Wolff said.  Technology has advanced so that the costs of components have come down dramatically.""Once a Sarcos robot collects the data, that's where the cloud comes in.Microsoft's sales team courts industrial companies like Sarcos with its Azure platform, and has built a lab in its Redmond, Washington, headquarters where companies can take their products and work with Microsoft to get everything connected to the cloud, Wolff said. But Microsoft is not the only cloud provider vying to break into the industrial space.""While I am sure that [Microsoft] is positioning itself for growth in the manufacturing sector, there are other options — and there are many manufacturing customers that are using those options,"" said Crawford Del Prete, marketing research agency IDC's chief research officer. ""I think the real value for MSFT is in the developer networks, and in their ability to attract developers from industries to Azure."" IDC's Bob Parker added that Microsoft's team ""are far from the only suitable (or even the best) option in manufacturing."" As money pours into industrial projects across the United States, competition to win cloud contracts could get fierce. ""We're at the beginning of something that is going to grow much much bigger over the next 10 years. Some places will be quite affected by automation,"" said Robert Seidl, managing partner at Motus Ventures, a Bay Area firm that invests in transportation, robotics and urban planning. ""There's a very large market opportunity in automotive. Then more broadly, the kinds of things that happen in technology. Not just driving and people-moving, but warehouses, packing and unpacking, and delivery, inspection in oil and gas, infrastructure inspection."" Seidl said he's not counting on an infrastructure boom to boost his portfolio. Plus, he said, there's a limited window: As computers get smaller and more powerful, more data can be crunched directly by the robots themselves.""I think it's worth being cautious about funding [until it] actually happens. American governments have been notoriously underfunded when it comes to infrastructure,"" Seidl said. ""We always tell our founders, 'Do not rely on other start-ups as customers, and don't rely on the government as your only customers. Funding can evaporate if there is an election.' That's a challenge for start-ups."" "
475,2017-05-23T08:15:18-0400," The Surface Pro was unveiled by Microsoft on Tuesday It's completely redesigned and features the latest processors from Intel There's a new keyboard and a new Surface Pen, too, though they aren't included The Surface Pro launches on June 15 and starts at $799 Microsoft announced its brand new Surface Pro laptop/tablet hybrid during a press conference in Shanghai on Tuesday.I had a chance to see the new Surface Pro in a meeting with Microsoft, and I think there's enough here to help the company boost its sinking Surface sales.The new model has no number attached to it. Although it follows the Surface Pro 4, which was released in October 2015, it's just called ""Surface Pro,"" rather than ""Surface Pro 5."" This suggests Microsoft is moving into a more regular cadence with the products, updating them regularly as Apple has done with its MacBook and iPad lines for some years now. It may also be trying to avoid confusion, as it now has several different products with the ""Surface"" brand attached to them, including two other laptops and a desktop.The new Surface Pro is a much more powerful machine with longer battery life -- Microsoft told me it should last up to 13.5 hours, or 50 percent more than the Surface Pro 4 -- and new features.It's equipped with Intel's latest seventh-generation Core processors, which offer more power and better battery life. These chips are not yet in Apple's MacBook or MacBook Pro, which are expected to get refreshed next month. That's a feather in Microsoft's cap.Unless you're buying the high-end model, you also won't find any fans, which means the machines are extremely quiet. The kickstand, which sits flush with the device when not in use, now tilts down to a 165-degree angle, allowing the machine to be propped up on a desk for drawing with the Surface Pen. You can also use Microsoft's Surface Dial, first introduced with the Surface Studio desktop last year, which can be placed on the screen and used for anything from flipping through PowerPoint to zooming around 3D Maps and editing in Adobe Photoshop.The $99 Surface Pen, which is still bizarrely not included with the Surface Pro, is a must-have accessory. Microsoft doubled the levels of pressure supported by the device, which means you can draw and write more accurately, with penmanship that better reflects your handwriting. Users will also find much more accurate tilting and shading, allowing the pen to function like a real pencil in some applications.Unlike Apple, Microsoft kept a full-sized USB port on the side of the Surface Pro, which I appreciate. While I understand USB-C is the future, most people still own plenty of standard-sized USB gadgets, which means plugging in a keyboard or mouse will work without the need for an adapter.Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 keyboard was the first in the Surface series I could type on for extended periods of time. The new keyboard builds on that one with increased key travel for a more comfortable experience, though I did notice the keypad still has a bit of flex on it when I typed with force.The whole Surface Pro package is extremely familiar, despite these changes, which is a good strategy for Microsoft. I think people really enjoyed its previous Surface Pro 4 laptop, and believe sales slowed because consumers wanted something newer.There's going to be some cannibalism going on within Microsoft's Surface family, however.When the firm introduced the Surface Pro 4, it didn't offer any other ""Surface-branded"" products. Now it has several, including the Surface Book, a high-end hybrid that competes most directly with Apple's MacBook Pro; the Surface Laptop, a lower-end laptop whose screen cannot be removed to use like a tablet; and the Surface Studio desktop.But I think most people should buy the Surface Pro.The Surface Laptop is targeted at the education sector and features a hobbled version of Windows 10 that will need to be upgraded by most users.The Surface Book is a fantastic machine and can be configured with a dedicated graphics chip for folks who need to edit videos or to play some light games. But it starts at $1499 -- almost double the price of the entry-level Surface Pro.Overall, the Surface Pro is the most versatile of the bunch and offers the best balance between price, portability and features. It's available for pre-order today starting at $799 (though the model we recommend you buy will set you back more than $1,500), and will start shipping on June 15. "
476,2017-05-23T13:52:15-0400," Microsoft has a whole family of Surface computers Unless you've been paying close attention, you might find them a hair confusing We'll walk you through who the Surface Pro, Surface Book, Surface Laptop and Surface Studio are for Microsoft introduced the Surface Pro on Tuesday. It joins several other Surface-branded products that are built and sold by Microsoft.You have a right to be confused, however, especially since Microsoft hasn't been known as a computer maker until just a couple of years ago. You might even remember that Microsoft introduced a different product, the Surface Laptop, just last weekWhat the heck is the difference?Fear not. Microsoft's strategy is relatively simple to understand, if a bit different than Apple's product marketing.Here are Microsoft's Surface products, what they offer and who they're for.Surface ProMicrosoft's Surface Pro is the successor to the Surface Pro 4 -- Microsoft abandoned the number this time.You can think of it as a tablet (Microsoft would have you think otherwise), that doubles as a laptop if you purchase Microsoft's keyboard accessory. It's the most versatile machine, making it the most appealing to all consumer types.It offers a range of processors, from the entry-level Intel Core M to the high-end Intel Core 7, a touchscreen display, support for pen input and more. It even has a built-in kickstand, so you can work or watch movies without the keyboard attached. The Surface Pro starts at $799 without a keyboard or pen.Surface LaptopThe Surface Laptop was introduced a couple of weeks ago and is going to be initially targeted at the education sector. That's because it runs a special version of Windows 10 called Windows 10 S out of the box. It's easier for school IT departments to manage and prevents users from installing apps that aren't in the Windows Store.It's available with powerful processors, but most users are going to want to pay to upgrade to a full version of Windows to take full advantage of the device. With that unlocked, you're looking at a high-end thin-and-light machine.The Surface Laptop does have a touch screen, but the display and keyboard can't be removed, like they can on the Surface Book and Surface Pro. The Surface Laptop starts at $999.Surface BookThe Surface Book is Microsoft's premium laptop with the most powerful parts. Unlike the Surface Laptop, the screen can be detached and used as a tablet. With a full metal body and a metal keyboard, you can think of this as the machine that most competes with Apple's high-end MacBook Pros.The Surface Book with Performance base, the top-tier version, was introduced last year and includes the latest graphics processing units from NVIDIA, making this a machine more capable of editing video and photos than the Surface Pro or Surface Laptop. If you aren't doing those sorts of tasks, consider the Surface Laptop or Surface Pro instead.The Surface Book starts at $1,499.Surface StudioThe Surface Studio is Microsoft's desktop computer. It's an all-in-one machine with a touchscreen display, support for Microsoft's Surface Pen and more. The components inside the laptop are attached to the display, like an iMac, which is why it's called an ""all in one.""It's also the most powerful out of all of these machines, since Microsoft is able to fit more components inside a machine that's not portable. Microsoft believes it's a machine best suited by creators, like folks working in Photoshop, 3D software and more. It could work just as well as a home computer, though it's certainly not a cheap one.The Surface Studio starts at $2,999."
477,2014-07-17T05:23:39-0400," Microsoft Corp is set to cut more than 6,000 jobs in an announcement expected early Thursday, according to sources familiar with the matter, as it trims its newly acquired Nokia phone business and reshapes itself as a cloud-computing and mobile-friendly software company.   What could be the deepest job cuts in the company's 39-year history come five months into the tenure of Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, who outlined plans for a ""leaner"" business in a public memo to employees last week.Read MoreMicrosoft poised to trump Yahoo in digital ad space  Many of the cuts are expected to come from the Nokia unit, which Microsoft acquired in April for $7.2 billion, pushing up Microsoft's headcount by a quarter to 127,000. Microsoft said when it struck the deal to buy the Finnish phone maker that it would cut $600 million per year in costs within 18 months of closing the acquisition.   Microsoft is also expected to trim staffing at its Xbox game and entertainment unit, which Nadella last week praised but stopped short of describing as a ""core"" business.   Nadella's cuts are set to be the biggest at the Redmond, Washington-based company since his predecessor Steve Ballmer axed 5,800, or about 6 percent of headcount at that time, in the depths of recession in early 2009.   The new CEO's move is designed to help Microsoft shift from being a primarily software-focused company to one that sells online services, apps and devices that it hopes will make people and businesses more productive. Nadella needs to make Microsoft a stronger competitor to Google Inc and Apple Inc, which have dominated the new era of mobile-centric computing.  Read MoreMicrosoft toannounce job cuts this week: Report  Marking this change of emphasis, Nadella last week rebranded Microsoft as ""the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world.""

478,2017-05-21T09:06:06-0400," The weight of each Twizzler varies just a little bit because of slight variations in temperature. But when consumers buy a package, it promises them a specified net weight. A partnership with Microsoft has leveraged machine learning to fix the problem. The licorice-makers at Hershey's factory in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, have been trying for years to perfect the art of the Twizzler.The weight of each chewy, Helix-like licorice stick varies just a little bit because of slight variations in temperature, said George Lenhart, a senior manager at Hershey's who oversees disruptive technology. If the licorice gets even slightly too cold as it goes through the machines, it will be too light. A tiny bit too much heat makes the licorice heavy, Lenhart said.But when consumers buy a package, it promises them a specified net weight (such as 1 pound) or number of pieces of the fruit flavored candy. Hershey must consistently follow through, offering a pound or more per package. This has created a big, expensive mass production problem for the Twizzler assembly line. Yet now, a partnership with Microsoft has leveraged machine learning to teach robots the art of Twizzling.  Each 900-gallon batch of licorice must cook for 4 hours before traveling through holding tanks and pipes to a pressurized machine called an extruder, which pushes the licorice through like Play-Doh.If the licorice came out of the extruder too light, it either had to be re-extruded or more licorice needed to be added to the batch, a time-consuming process, Lenhart said.""We had to go a little heavy all the time,"" Lenhart said. On the other hand, if it came out too heavy, the machine produced an extra 100 grams of candy per minute, wasting precious ingredients. To minimize waste, Hershey's operators manually weighed the licorice every 15 minutes, adjusting the machine 12 times a day to try and standardize the Twizzlers.""Variability is something that we are always are trying to minimize,"" Lenhart said. ""They have spent years perfecting it, but if I could predict the weight of the licorice, would I be able to adjust the machine automatically.""He added: ""If the highs are not as high, lows are not as low, you are getting closer and closer to the net weight number is without going below. The less waste, the more profitable."" Lenhart has been obsessed with this since he joined Hershey's in 2010. He started by doing business intelligence and data-mining, and gained an intimate knowledge of each plant. Then, he attended a Microsoft tech conference, and it clicked.Hershey's set up a line to transmit data directly back and forth to Microsoft's Azure cloud, collecting more than 60 million data points from 23 sensors over two months. The system tracks pressure, temperature, rotations per minute, and other factors across the licorice-making process.After Lenhart was able to use the program to track which data points affected the final weight of the licorice, the machine learned to adjust itself about 240 times a day, reducing weight variability by 50 percent. Along the way, Lenhart also found other fixes across the factory.Now, Hershey's is building machine learning into its new lines. ""We are looking at the chocolate next,"" Lenhart said. ""The ingredients in chocolate are far more expensive, so small savings have a much higher return. We are putting plans together. They would love it if we could do it on every line right away."" "
479,2017-05-19T21:38:25-0400,"Microsoft on Friday unceremoniously revealed new prototype augmented-reality (AR) glasses that look like a normal pair of thick-framed glasses. The emergence of the technology indicates Microsoft has been thinking ways to go beyond the bulky and costly HoloLens headset it unveiled two years ago.""There's still a lot of work to be done,"" Microsoft researchers Andrew Maimone, Andreas Georgiou, and Joel Kollin wrote in a paper describing the glasses containing holographic display prototypes, which employ a technique called digital holography. The researchers will talk about their work at the Siggraph conference in Los Angeles in August.The paper comes a few weeks after Facebook talked about building AR glasses. Snap, which sells camera sunglasses for its Snapchat messaging app, has introduced AR software features, although it has not yet indicated it's working on proper AR glasses. Apple is also thought to be developing AR technology.AR generally involves superimposing virtual images on top of what you actually see. Virtual reality (VR), by comparison, entails completely covering your eyesight and showing you artificial imagery. The researchers did explore using their display prototypes for VR, although they noted that their more ambitious work lies in AR.As a research endeavor, this new Microsoft hardware might not ever be mass-produced, although it does indicate some people inside the company are interested in exploring different shapes and sizes for its holographic technology.""We show various capabilities of near-eye holographic displays (wide field of view, compact form factors, multi-focus, etc.) but we have not yet achieved all these capabilities in a single device,"" the researchers wrote. What they do have, they wrote, is a monoscopic tethered system. There is no way to track the movement of a person's head of eyes. Still, it's a start."

And it's not just a home for tech, either: The campus also includes the likes of L'Oreal, LVMH and BNP Paribas.""They love being able to talk to people that have encountered the same difficulties, that have resources, that have contacts, so they're really sharing with each other and I think that's the main resource that you find here,"" Roxanne Varza, the program director for Station F, said of the start-ups and entrepreneurs there.Station F was backed by French telecom billionaire Xavier Niel, who poured $285 million into the project and was launched around the same time French President Emmanuel Macron took office. Macron has vowed to make France a ""startup nation.""At Station F, Benjamin Joffe, a partner at hardware accelerator HAX which is part of venture capital firm SOSV, praised France's recent improvements in its available talent, government support and access to early-stage capital.""France now has a lot of the elements necessary to actually create new companies,"" he said.But, while the aim of Station F is to put France on the international start-up map, Joffe also still sees potential barriers.""What's still missing in the ecosystem are things around skills for growth, maybe marketing skills as well, knowledge of international markets and the last thing that's also missing, I think, in the environment, is the habits and knowledge around exits,"" he added. ""A lot of start-ups are being created, but really the proof comes when you have an exit."""
481,2017-05-16T14:20:06-0400," Credit Suisse predicts the recent cyberattacks will spur upgrades to Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system, which is immune from the WannaCry malware. The firm reiterates its outperform rating on Microsoft and price target of $80. Investors should buy Microsoft shares because the recent cyberattacks will spur companies to upgrade to the technology giant's latest operating system, according to Credit Suisse, which reiterated its outperform rating on the software firm. The WannaCry ransomware malware hit 200,000 victims in 150 countries due to security holes in older Microsoft Windows operating systems. ""The recent global ransomware attack exploiting a flaw in Windows, while serious, not only demonstrates the continued ubiquity of Microsoft, but also highlights that many of the affected enterprises or entities that are still using older, and now unsupported, versions of Windows need to accelerate their plans to upgrade to Windows 10,"" analyst Michael Nemeroff wrote in a note to clients Monday entitled ""If you're not current, you're toast.""""We believe the recent ransomware attack could accelerate the Windows upgrade cycle for enterprises, which would drive further upside to Office 365 Commercial MAUs [monthly active users] beyond what is currently factored into our estimates,"" he added.  The analyst reiterated his $80 price target for Microsoft, representing 18 percent upside from Monday's close. Nemeroff cited how 85 percent of companies haven't yet upgraded to the latest Windows 10 operating system, according to Credit Suisse's corporate survey. He estimates Microsoft will generate earnings-per-share of $3.35 in fiscal 2018 compared to the Wall Street consensus of $3.31. ""We view MSFT shares as attractive due to the significant earnings power potential over the next several years,"" he wrote."
482,2017-05-13T11:48:54-0400,"UK hospitals, Telefonica, FedEx, and other businesses were hit by a massive ransomware attack on Friday. Around 75,000 computers in 99 countries were affected by malware known as WannaCry, which encrypts a computer and demands a $300 ransom before unlocking it. The malware was able to spread thanks to flaws in old versions of Windows that were originally used by the NSA to hack into PCs before being made public by the Shadow Brokers group last month.While Microsoft quickly issued fixes for the latest versions of Windows last month, this left Windows XP unprotected. Many of the machines attacked today have been breached simply because the latest Windows updates have not been applied quickly enough, but there are still organizations that continue to run Windows XP despite the risks. Microsoft is now taking what it describes as a ""highly unusual"" step to provide public patches for Windows operating systems that are in custom support only. This includes specific fixes for Windows XP, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2003.More from The Verge:Amazon didn't think about privacy with its new Echo calling and messaging featuresThe Windows Store is looking a lot like the future of WindowsUK hospitals hit with massive ransomware attackMicrosoft usually charges businesses to provide custom support agreements for older versions of Windows, which include critical and important software updates from Microsoft beyond the normal end of extended support point. ""Seeing businesses and individuals affected by cyberattacks, such as the ones reported today, was painful,"" explains Phillip Misner, a security group manager at Microsoft. ""Given the potential impact to customers and their businesses, we made the decision to make the Security Update for platforms in custom support only.""It's an unusual move for Microsoft, but this security flaw and the way it was discovered and made public is equally unusual. There are now signs that the ransomware attack has subsided thanks to a kill switch, discovered by a 22-year-old in the UK. Some experts believe the attackers behind the ransomware have only raised around $20,000 from the scam. Either way, this is yet another painful security lesson for everyone involved. Exploits should be disclosed by government agencies, systems should be patched in a timely manner, and nobody should be running an old supported version of Windows."
483,2017-05-11T11:30:00-0400," Microsoft unveiled the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update during its developer conference on Thursday Windows 10 Fall Creators Update will be available later this year New features include user interface changes, a new option called ""Timeline"" and changes to the Cortana personal assistant. Microsoft just announced the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, the company's next big refresh of its Windows 10 operating system.Terry Myerson, Microsoft's executive vice president of the Windows and devices group, revealed the update during Day Two of Microsoft's Build developer conference on Thursday. The refresh follows Microsoft's first Creators Update, which started rolling out to Windows machines last month.Myerson highlighted several new features coming to the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. A new feature called ""Timeline"" will provide users with ""a visual timeline that displays what you what you were doing [and] when,"" which allows users to quickly pick up on an existing project. That means you can start work on a computer, for example, and then pick up where you left off if you switch machines.The personal assistant Cortana will also understand what you're working on across different machines, whether it's a phone or your computer. ""Imagine logging off your PC and having the doc you were editing pop up on your phone,"" Myerson said. ""Cortana asks if you want to pick up where you left off in your app, doc or website. It's like having your PC and your phone finish each other's sentences."" This feature, again, lets you work on a document on a smartphone while riding the train to work, for example, and then pick up right where you left off when you boot up your computer at work.Other changes include tweaks to OneDrive for on-demand file access and a new clipboard that allows you to copy content on one device and paste it on another. The latter is a function that Apple already offers users through a feature called ""Universal Clipboard.""Myerson added that the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update will also look different, thanks to what Microsoft is calling a ""Fluent Design System"" that will create a common user interface across devices.The Fall Creators Update will be available later this year,  Myerson said."
484,2017-05-11T21:12:26-0400,"Microsoft developers cheered on Thursday when the company unveiled its latest image-recognition technology, which is coming soon to Windows 10 devices. The moment underscored Microsoft's investment in artificial intelligence (AI) and its determination to keep up with Alphabet and Apple.Using the new Story Remix app -- which is meant to replace the standard-issue Windows 10 Photos app -- Microsoft executive Lorraine Bardeen showed how users can add animations on top of videos that then move along with the action. She selected a video of a girl dribbling a soccer ball and then superimposed a fireball on top of the soccer ball as it was sailing toward the net.In addition to editing videos, the app will let people search for photos and videos based on the people, places and videos they contain -- just like the Google Photos app that came out in 2015 and Apple's most recent Photos app from last year. Microsoft began working on the app a year and a half ago.""What you're basically seeing is everyone in the industry is taking advantage of deep learning and how it's revolutionizing how we build products,"" said Chris Pratley, a Microsoft corporate vice president, in an interview. Deep learning is a type of AI that involves training computers on data such as photos and allowing the computers to make inferences about new data.The app relies on several Microsoft technologies. For one thing, it uses the Cognitive Toolkit open-source framework for deep learning. Microsoft trained the system on a shared cluster of graphical processing units (GPUs) in its Azure cloud, and it looked to the company's research group for technology that can recognize and then follow objects in videos.The app works because Microsoft has so much data. For example, the company looked to prisons for images of people as they aged over time. Users also granted Microsoft access to photos and videos to help the company's engineers build out the system.""We certainly don't use anyone's data to train on unless they give us permission,"" Pratley said. From there, Microsoft employees contributed to the knowledge of the neural network by confirming that tags of photos were correct. Once Microsoft has sufficiently trained the neural network, it runs on Windows 10 PCs, using the power of those computers.""This is one of the things that makes PCs great: I can use local computation and the GPU to analyze every frame of a video,"" Pratley said. ""Once we know pictures of a soccer ball in every frame, it's trivial to re-render video. The hard part was even knowing it was an object and then computing all of that. That's very hard to do on a phone.""Microsoft has previously used deep learning to translate spoken words in Skype and to write descriptions of photos in PowerPoint presentations. Now the company is applying the technology to a wider swath of personal content. Over time the system might well get smarter with the help of users' donated data, Pratley said."

According to the filing, the technology also includes warnings, such as advice to avoid that late night burrito, and it ingests nutritional information from third-party restaurants. The system might also be used to help guide decisions around food preparation and shopping. Research firm CBInsights pointed us to the filing, which it noticed earlier.Technology companies are in a battle to modernize the process of nutrition tracking, which currently requires manual input. If smart technology could automate the process, it would provide much-needed transparency to users about the nutritional content of their meals. As CBInsights points out, Apple patented a system that uses RFID to help track the calories in restaurant orders. Microsoft has also filed previously diet-related patents. Startups are also targeting the space. An app called Lark already offers food-logging and personalized recommendations to the Apple Watch. Watch: Microsoft unveils new products"

With its Cortana Skills Kit, Microsoft is making it possible for outside developers to bring their services to Windows 10 as well as the company's Skype for Business app and Bing search engine. Microsoft also unveiled new tools to help people more easily incorporate artificial intelligence into their applications. Microsoft's Cortana isn't the trendiest voice-activated personal assistant — that title goes to Amazon's Alexa — and its Azure public cloud plays second fiddle to Amazon Web Services.On Tuesday at the company's annual Build conference in Seattle, Microsoft executives spent hours showing how they plan to change that.CEO Satya Nadella also pointed out one edge that Microsoft still has over Amazon: its massive reach in enterprises. People who use Windows machines and Cortana are ""the most valuable set of users in the core of the enterprise,"" Nadella said. People are using Windows 10 on more than 500 million devices every month, while Cortana now has 140 million monthly active users.With the introduction of its Cortana Skills Kit, Microsoft is making it possible for outside developers to bring their services to Windows 10 as well as the company's Skype for Business video conferencing app and Bing search engine. In doing so, Microsoft is trying to make it more worthwhile for developers to build for Cortana, and open up its services for more third-party features. Also, longtime Microsoft partners HP and Intel will be working to build Cortana-enabled devices.Microsoft also unveiled new tools to help people more easily incorporate artificial intelligence into their applications. This is an area where Amazon has been busy lately — last week it announced plans for a U.K. development center that will house A.I. researchers — but Microsoft has long performed academic research.Nadella also used the opportunity to make some philosophical statements about AI, saying it's up to Microsoft ""to ensure that some of the more dystopian scenarios don't come true."" If anything, he said, the company should ""empower people with technology.""Toward that end, Harry Shum, the company's executive vice president for A.I. and research, showed off a new add-in for the PowerPoint presentation app that will give audience members real-time translations of presenters' spoken comments through smartphones.When it comes to the cloud, Nadella and other executives are less bold and more interested in meeting current market demands — which means matching Amazon when it comes to available features. That's important because an increasing number of companies are choosing which big public cloud they should use when they want to build new applications and more efficiently run existing ones.For instance, Microsoft introduced services for migrating Oracle databases to its Azure cloud and launched Android and iOS apps for managing cloud resources. AWS already provides all of those things.Watch: Will Microsoft's new software challenge Google?"

Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows 10, is now being used on 500 million devices every month, the company says.CEO Satya Nadella announced the milestone in his keynote address Wednesday morning at Microsoft's Build conference for developers in Seattle.At the 2015 Build conference in April of that year, a few months before Windows 10 launched, Windows chief Terry Myerson predicted the operating system would be installed on 1 billion devices within three years. But last year Microsoft acknowledged that it wouldn't hit that goal.The milestone counts devices, not individual users, because some users may have multiple PCs running Windows 10, which the company cannot easily track. This report is more conservative than some of Microsoft's past Windows usage milestones because it counts devices on which Windows 10 is actually installed and used. In the past, Microsoft has sometimes counted licenses that have been sold but not actually rolled out by big organizations.Nadella also gave some other usage stats for Microsoft products: Cortana, Microsoft's digital assistant, which is built into Windows 10, is used by 140 million people every month. Office 365 has more than 100 million people using it per month in businesses or other organizations (""monthly commercial active users:). Microsoft's cloud is used by more than 90 percent of the Fortune 500. Nadella and other execs are slated to talk at the Build keynote Wednesday morning. You can follow the live stream here."
489,2017-05-08T10:39:22-0400," Microsoft is expected to announce Cortana-powered speakers this week. The company's BUILD developer conference begins on Wednesday. Harman Kardon is one partner, and images of the company's ""Invoke"" speaker recently appeared online. Microsoft and Harman Kardon took the wraps off a new speaker with the Cortana voice assistant installed, helping Microsoft take on Amazon Echo and Google Home.The speaker is called the Invoke. Users can ask Cortana to play music, set calendar appointments, check the traffic, listen to the latest news, control smart home thermostats and more, Microsoft said in a blog post Monday.Cortana, Microsoft's voice assistant, has so far existed only on mobile devices and in the company's Windows operating system. Like Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and Google's Assistant, Cortana can provide information on the weather, stocks, sports scores and more.So far, however, Microsoft hasn't sold a standalone product that provides users with access to Cortana.The Invoke stands out against competitors with one unique feature. It has Skype built in, which allows users to call cellphones and other Skype users. Google, despite offering services similar to Skype, still hasn't added this functionality to Google Home.More details are expected at Microsoft's annual BUILD developer conference, which starts Wednesday.Microsoft still needs support from developers, however, especially if it wants its smart home product to work with the growing number of apps and services. Alexa and Home have thousands of ""skills"" for example, which allow users to control their homes, stream music, ask for recipes and more."
490,2017-05-09T14:51:41-0400,"Microsoft has been working on a new HomeHub feature for Windows 10 to better compete with devices like Amazon's Echo. HomeHub is designed to create a family environment for a PC with shared access to calendars, apps, and even a new welcome screen. Microsoft is even planning to support smart home devices like Philips' Hue lights, to enable Windows 10 to act as a hub to control and manage smart home hardware. While  we've heard about HomeHub before, The Verge has obtained internal concepts of exactly how Microsoft is imagining HomeHub will work.The major addition is a new welcome screen that includes an ""always on"" digital corkboard to let families use to-do lists, calendars, and notes. The welcome screen is really designed for kitchen PCs and new smaller hardware with screens that will support Cortana voice commands from across the room. Microsoft appears to be readying Windows 10 for future devices that are similar to  Amazon's new Echo Show hardware, with easy access to voice search, calling, and smart device control. Microsoft's differentiator is that it wants these devices to be considered full Windows 10 PCs.Microsoft is aiming to include the new welcome screen, shared desktops, and easy calling in the Windows 10 update due in September. This update should also include improvements to Cortana, and support for third-party smart home devices. Microsoft's plan for supporting smart devices looks a lot like Apple's own Home app, with the ability to manage and control smart devices directly within Windows 10.More from The Verge: Microsoft Build 2017: what to expect from this week's conferenceHarman Kardon teases its Cortana-powered speakerWindows 10 S won't let you change the default browser or switch to Google searchMicrosoft is tentatively planning to support Hue, Nest, Insteon, Wink, and SmartThings devices with its connected home app. Cortana will be used to send commands to devices, just like Amazon's Echo. Microsoft has been working with PC makers including HP and Lenovo to create new hardware or refresh existing PCs with a focus on this new home effort. Both HP and Lenovo are expected to have all-in-one PCs ready for the holiday period with support for waking up with Cortana voice commands and the new welcome screen feature for Windows 10.Any devices that come with these new Windows 10 features will rely on PC partners to create. Microsoft is holding a special event on May 23rd in Shanghai where it's planning to ""show the world what's next."" Given that Microsoft will need the full support of OEMs to build special devices for its dream of the shared kitchen PC, Shanghai seems like the perfect venue for Microsoft's new push into the home."
491,2017-06-13T02:03:45-0400," Sony has sold 60.4 million PlayStation 4 units since its launch in November 2013.  PlayStation software sales led by games such as ""Horizon: Zero Dawn"", hit 487.8 million copies. PlayStation Plus recorded 26.4 million paid subscribers. Sony said on Tuesday it has sold 60.4 million PlayStation 4 games consoles since it launched just over three years ago, continuing momentum for one of the Japanese technology giant's key products.The figure is up 7 million units from the 53.4 million reported on January 5, the last time Sony publicly revealed sales numbers.Sony also said that software sales, led by key games such as ""Horizon: Zero Dawn"", hit 487.8 million copies. While hardware sales are always crucial, recurring revenues via subscription models has become increasingly important for Sony to take advantage of its large install base. The company said that it had more than 70 million monthly active users globally at the end of March, while PlayStation Plus recorded 26.4 million paid subscribers.PlayStation Plus is a $59.99 a year subscription service that allows users to play games online with other people as well as access a library of free games. On top of the subscription model, Sony has jumped into the virtual reality (VR) space last year, launching the PlayStation VR headset and games. There was no word of the latest sales of that device in Sony's latest release, but the company said last week that the figure was over 1 million units. The Japanese titan said it would continue to boost its efforts in VR and other areas.""We are committed to further expanding our overall PS4 ecosystem, by broadening the PlayStation VR content portfolio, as well as enriching our network services along with our ground-breaking software lineup,"" Andrew House, President and Global CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment, said in a press release.Sony has looked to maintain momentum in the gaming division through the release of revamped hardware. Last year it launched a slimmer version of the PS4, and also revealed the PlayStation 4 Pro, a souped up model of the original. The company's sales figure announcement comes just two days after its closest rival Microsoft unveiled its latest console — the Xbox One X. Its current flagship console known as the Xbox One has struggled to keep up with the PlayStation 4 and is estimated to have sold 33 million units since its launch in November 2013, according to numbers from research firm SuperData. Microsoft does not release official figures for Xbox sales.Microsoft's Xbox One X is an attempt to fight back against Sony but the $499 price tag, which is $100 than the PlayStation 4 Pro has worried analysts.""The launch price is a bit steep in our opinion,"" Mizuho said in a note on Monday. ""The Xbox One X bests the technical specifications for the PlayStation Pro ... but at $499, it'll cost $100 more than the PlayStation Pro which we expect will have stronger exclusive titles over the next year."" The gaming division of Sony has become one of its most important growth drivers where other areas such as smartphones have slowed. In the 12 months to March 31, operating profit hit  135.6 billion yen ($1.23 billion), a 52.9 percent year-on-year rise. It was Sony's second-largest division by operating profit, behind financial services. Sony shares were trading around 0.4 percent lower on Tuesday, but are up over 23 percent year-to-date."
492,2017-05-05T09:08:36-0400," Tariq Shaukat, president of customers at Google Cloud, says the company doesn't need to compete on price but on value.  Shaukat said Google's machine learning and AI expertise will help it win.  Google doesn't need to compete on price to beat rivals Microsoft and Amazon in the cloud computing business, a top executive told CNBC, amid concerns that there could be a pricing war as technology firms get aggressive to acquire customers.In a phone interview earlier this week, Tariq Shaukat, president of customers at Google Cloud, said that the company's pricing structure, which allows businesses to pay per minute of usage, is unique.""We don't need to compete on price to be honest. We definitely compete on value more than price … but if you look at the products, (they) are hard to compare side by side,"" Shaukat told CNBC.""We believe that our pricing models are much more friendly. So just simply by adopting the more flexible pricing models we have, things like billing by the minute rather than the hour, we think we can save a typical company 20 to 30 percent without having a unit price different to the competition.""Last year, Amazon and Google both cut the price of some of their cloud products, with Microsoft following suit this year. The three are locked in a battle in the cloud space with Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud division, leading the way.Some analysts are concerned that the continued downward spiral of prices could hit margins on some of these businesses.""I don't think that looking at prices itself as opposed to the value being delivered to the customer is the right way to look at it,"" Shaukat added.Data is keyFor Google, value means telling prospective and current customers that it is the best at data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.""Our skill set capability in data management, machine learning, is second to none and we think that will be one of the key adopters in cloud adoption,"" Shaukat said.Google has been investing heavily in AI including via acquisitions, the most notable of which was British company Deepmind for $400 million in 2014. But on top of that, the company has been trying to boost the products it sells via the cloud. For example, it has G Suite - its cloud-based documents, email and calendar applications - that it sells to businesses.Analysts said, however, that compared to Microsoft and Amazon, Google's software applications aren't as wide-ranging, and it's an area the company should focus on.""When you look at Google you have to say they need to start pushing more services in the software space to compete with Microsoft in that environment,"" Nick McQuire, vice president of enterprise at CCS Insight, told CNBC by phone on Friday.Adding these extra services can help to boost revenue, gain more customers and keep margins healthy, McQuire added.Bid to take on AmazonStill, Google Cloud has gained momentum recently signing large customers like HSBC, adding to its current portfolio which includes the likes of Spotify and Coca-Cola. Google parent company Alphabet does not break out the cloud segment separately in its earnings but instead includes it in the ""other revenues"" section which also includes hardware among other businesses. In the first quarter of 2017, other revenues grew over 49 percent to just over $3 billion. It's still a relatively small business in the context of Alphabet's overall revenues.Meanwhile, AWS alone brought in $3.6 billion for Amazon in the first quarter.But Google is continuing to pick up momentum and has so far invested $30 billion in the cloud business. It is expanding into several new regions this year to expand its global footprint.Last month, the head of Google's cloud business Diane Greene said the company could surpass Amazon as the market leader by 2022. Shaukat cited a report by Deutsche Bank that said cloud providers have only penetrated 5 percent of the market, so there is plenty of room to grow.""Within five years we can overtake Amazon in the market and that is all based on this idea that only 5 percent of workloads are currently in the cloud that could go into the cloud. What happens today is not a terribly good predictor of what is going to happen in the future,"" Shaukat told CNBC."

In addition, Nashville, Tennessee, will be home to what Amazon is calling an ""Operations Center of Excellence,"" adding 5,000 corporate jobs.The world's third-most valuable company behind Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp will boost its presence around New York City and the nation's capital while also giving it more of a foothold in the center of the country as it seeks to gain a recruiting edge over Silicon Valley tech companies. Hiring at the new facilities will begin in 2019.The new Washington metro region headquarters will be located in National Landing, in Arlington, Virginia, and the New York City headquarters will be located in the Long Island City neighborhood in Queens, across the East River from Midtown Manhattan and the United Nations.The area now includes some high-rise apartment blocks, a narrow canal, and manufacturing and warehouse buildings. Its attractions include a large Pepsi-Cola advertising sign and a clock counting down the hours until the end of U.S. President Donald Trump's first presidential term.""These two locations will allow us to attract world-class talent that will help us to continue inventing for customers for years to come,"" said Amazon founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos. Bezos is the world's richest man with about $130 billion in Amazon stock alone.The company said on Tuesday it will receive performance-based direct incentives of $1.525 billion from the state of New York, based on creating 25,000 jobs in Long Island City.Amazon will receive performance-based direct incentives of $573 million based on the company creating 25,000 jobs with an average wage of over $150,000 in Arlington.The world's largest online retailer has already been awarded more than $1.6 billion of state and local public subsidies across the United States since 2000, with most of that after 2012, according to a database from the Washington-based government watchdog Good Jobs First.Amazon did not comment on the Good Jobs First numbers but said it has invested $160 billion in the United States since 2010, including in warehouses, data centers and employee compensation. IIt estimated New York would see incremental tax revenue of more than $10 billion over 20 years as a result of its investment and job creation; Virginia would take in $3.2 billion; and Tennessee more than $1 billion over 10 years.In Nashville, Amazon will receive performance-based direct incentives of up to $102 million based on the company creating 5,000 jobs with an average wage of over $150,000.Amazon said the job-creation incentives it expected amounted to $48,000 per position in New York and $22,000 per job in Virginia.""Economic incentives were one factor in our decision - but attracting top talent was the leading driver,"" Amazon said on its corporate blog.YEAR-LONG COMPETITIONAmazon had received 238 proposals from across North America vying for a home base in addition to its Seattle headquarters. New York and Virginia beat out 18 others, including Los Angeles and Chicago, on a short list Amazon released in January.Cities and states promised billions of dollars of tax breaks and other inducements in exchange for Amazon's so-called HQ2. They also handed over infrastructure, labor and other data that could prove useful in other ways to Amazon.It was not immediately clear how negotiations unfolded once Amazon settled on the plan for two offices. The company had originally said it would spend more than $5 billion and add up to 50,000 workers at one location.Amazon said the split would give it more geographic diversity for recruiting and could also help lessen congestion and cost-of-living increases that would have accompanied one bigger office.The company has already had to navigate similar issues at its more than 45,000-person urban campus in Seattle. An affordable housing crisis there prompted the city council to adopt a head tax on businesses in May, which Amazon helped overturn in a subsequent city council vote.Some critics had pushed for more transparency from cities and states in the bidding process, warning that the benefits of hosting a massive Amazon office may not offset the taxpayer-funded incentives and other costs.The company has said it helped boost Seattle's economy indirectly by $38 billion between 2010 and 2016. Construction and service work has increased, catering to Amazon, and the company said it also helped attract other businesses to Seattle.Amazon shares were up more than 1 percent in morning trade.(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco Additional reporting by Arjun Panchadar and Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru Writing by Nick Zieminski Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and Bill Rigby)"

But Microsoft's smartphone business never took off, and the company has essentially exited the smartphone market which it entered in 2013 with the purchase of Nokia. It has since then laid off most of the employees it gained in that acquisition and written down its entire value. The only way Microsoft would get back in, marketing manager Yusuf Mehdi told Bloomberg, is if it could do something different.The interview follows Microsoft's introduction on Tuesday of the Surface Laptop, a $999 device that runs a limited version of Windows for education called Windows 10 S. Microsoft is making a new push to grab more of the education market from Google's Chromebooks and Apple iPads, but the Surface Laptop is also an effort to get more students to consider Microsoft products in place of their favored Mac laptops.Microsoft's hardware team over the last few years has become a serious competitor to Apple products, with one recent device, the Surface Pro 3 combo laptop-tablet, besting the iPad in a recent customer satisfaction survey.Read the full Bloomberg article here.Watch: Will Microsoft's software challenge Google"
497,2019-01-09T13:32:00-0500,"(Adds comment from attorneys, background)Jan 9 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, the world's richest man, and wife MacKenzie Bezos are divorcing after 25 years of marriage, the couple said on Twitter on Wednesday.Jeff Bezos, 54, has a fortune that has soared as high as $160 billion thanks to his stake in Amazon, which again became Wall Street's most valuable company this week, surpassing Microsoft Inc.Bezos has credited MacKenzie, 48, for her support when he uprooted the young couple from New York to Seattle so he could launch the online bookseller that grew into one of the world's largest retailers. MacKenzie, a Princeton graduate who is now a novelist, did accounting for Amazon for its first year after it was founded in 1994.The couple decided to divorce after a long period of ""loving exploration"" and trial separation, and expect to continue as partners in ventures and projects, according to the joint statement.Amazon shares were up 0.2 percent in midday trading on Wednesday. The divorce should have no material impact on the company and its shares, said Thomas Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson &amp; Co.According to Refinitiv Eikon data, MacKenzie does not hold any Amazon shares directly. Bezos has a 16.1 percent stake in the company worth about $130 billion.Liat Sadler, a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer, noted that spouses owe a fiduciary duty to one another.They have duties not to waste or devalue marital resources, and to keep the value of marital property as high as possible, she said. I don't think there is an issue of concern for shareholders as to what will happen to Amazon because of the divorce.""Sadler said the main options facing the couple regarding Amazon stock were for Jeff Bezos to buy out his wife or for MacKenzie Bezos to retain shares.""If she trusts that he would manage Amazon well, either he should pay her for her share of the stock, or they could enter a more complicated agreement where she keeps stock and he keeps voting rights, she said.It is unlikely that many details of the divorce will become public, New York lawyer Bernard Clair, who is representing Judith Giuliani in her divorce from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, said. These two have been separated for a not insignificant time, and I would assume ... they would have used the time to reach a private, confidential agreement, Clair said.Reuters was unable to determine any further financial details of the planned divorce. Amazon did not immediately return requests for comment about the status of the Bezos ownership stake or what impact the divorce might have on the company.MacKenzie Bezos met her husband when interviewing for a job at a New York hedge fund, according to a 2013 profile in Vogue. The two were engaged after three months of dating and married three months after that, according to the magazine. The pair have four children.Speaking at an event in Berlin last April, Jeff Bezos said MacKenzie's support was instrumental when he founded Amazon.""When you have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risks,"" he said at the event.Jeff Bezos in September committed $2 billion through the Bezos Day One Fund to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities. He had solicited ideas on Twitter in 2017 for ways to donate some of his wealth.Last January, the couple donated $33 million to fund college scholarships for U.S. high schoolers with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, an Obama-era program protecting young immigrants brought to the United States illegally by their parents.In 2012, they donated $2.5 million to a Washington state campaign to legalize same-sex nuptials there.From modest beginnings, Amazon branched out into almost every product category, taking on established retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.In November, Amazon picked America's financial and political capitals for massive new offices, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in both New York City and just outside Washington, D.C.Jeff Bezos also founded space company Blue Origin in 2000, and is funneling $1 billion a year of his own fortune into pulling it out of start-up mode and into production.He also owns the Washington Post, which has been a target of criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.

498,2017-05-02T13:16:13-0400," The Surface Laptop costs $999 and runs Windows 10 S. Windows 10 S is targeted at education and will be on a variety of laptops. The Surface Laptop can be upgraded to a full version of Windows 10 Pro. It's going to be appealing to everyone, not just students. Microsoft announced the Surface Laptop on Tuesday at an event highlighting the company's latest products for the education market. Although the Surface Laptop runs a watered-down version of Windows 10 and is targeted at the education segment, don't expect it to stay that way: it's both way too powerful and way too expensive to be truly focused on the education market.Rather, Microsoft is continuing to up the battle against Apple's Mac computers — and its own partners. But this time, it came at the fight from the side.Microsoft's messaging during the event was confusing at best. The company first seemed to be chasing after Google Chromebooks, the most popular computer currently in classrooms, by introducing a new version of its operating system called Windows 10 S.The new operating system is easy to manage and allows users to install applications only from the Windows Store — the millions of legacy Windows apps that make Windows such a useful ecosystem are mostly not permitted. Users are also limited to using Microsoft's Edge browser by default.Then it rolled the Surface Laptop -- a $999 computer that comes with similar hardware specifications as the latest MacBook, but with newer processors.Most Chromebooks are in a completely different class. $200 to $400 gets you a decent machine for interacting with Google's suite of products, like Gmail, Docs and, most recently, even Android apps, but you can't do much else. There's not usually much on board storage — the idea, in Google's world, is that you'll do most of your work in Google's cloud instead. So what was Microsoft doing showing a powerful computer hobbled with an operating system that doesn't let you do very much?Here's the trick: Consumers who buy the Surface Laptop can pay a one-time $49 upgrade fee to move from Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro. (That fee is going to be temporarily waived on devices priced $799 or higher, Microsoft told CNBC.) That upgrade allows users to use any browser they want and cuts down the walled-garden approach to apps, too, which means you can install anything outside of the Windows app store.In other words, Microsoft almost seemed to be disguising this device, slipping it under the radar as an educational product, when it's really going to go right after Apple's Macbook.The Surface Laptop is half the price of Microsoft's larger Surface Book laptop, which was first released in 2015. That machine is more targeted at stealing MacBook Pro users, which puts the Surface Laptop square against Apple's entry-level machines.It has all the hardware to compete, much more than what's required in a classroom. It runs on Intel's powerful Core i5 or Core i7 processors. That's enough muscle to run Adobe Photoshop and demanding applications, unlike Chromebooks.I think Microsoft's real target market here is students heading off to college. By positioning the Surface Laptop toward ""education"" it can attract a crowd that might otherwise be looking at MacBooks.Which brings me to my final point. Save for Windows 10 S, which can be upgraded easily, the Surface Laptop looks like a perfect machine for business. Again, it has the hardware, it's attractive in its design, it's thin and light, and it offers ports that are still important, like USB and SD, which Apple has abandoned in its designs.The Surface Laptop is too powerful and too attractive to remain an education play. It won't be long before this is targeted at consumers and businesses, too."

As is tradition, Panos Panay handed out the Surface Laptop to an audience member to demonstrate the new burgundy color. The Surface Laptop will ship in four colors: platinum, burgundy, cobalt blue, and graphite gold, and it's under 3 pounds in weight.Microsoft is using a 13.5-inch PixelSense display with a 3:2 aspect ratio. ""This is the thinnest LDC touch model every created and put into a laptop,"" says Panay, complete with 3.4 million pixels. The screen even supports Microsoft's Surface Pen, so you can draw on the display just like other Surface devices.""The performance on this device is absolutely amazing,"" says Panay. Microsoft is using the latest Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, and claims the battery life will last for 14.5 hours as a result. Microsoft claims the Surface Laptop is faster than the i7 MacBook Pro, and it has ""more battery life than any MacBook Air on the market today.""Microsoft has integrated vapor chambers into the aluminum finish on the rear of the device to help keep the Surface Laptop cool. ""It allows us to pack everything we need in there,"" says Panay. There are no speaker grills or holes, and Microsoft has integrated the speakers underneath the keyboard so the sound comes from under your fingers.Microsoft is starting preorders for the Surface Laptop today, priced starting at $999 for the Core i5 version with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of SSD storage.

The pair have four children.At a Business Insider event in Berlin last April, Jeff Bezos said MacKenzie's support was instrumental when he founded Amazon as an online bookseller in 1994, and that she did the accounting for the company in its first year.""When you have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risks,"" he said at the event.Jeff Bezos in September committed $2 billion to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities. He had solicited ideas on Twitter in 2017 for ways to donate some of his wealth.In 2012, the couple donated $2.5 million to a Washington state campaign to legalize same-sex nuptials there.From modest beginnings as an online bookseller, Bezos and Amazon branched out into almost every product category available, ending up taking on established retail giants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc.Under Bezos, Amazon launched the Kindle e-reader and revolutionized the way books are distributed and read. The company has also been a pioneer in cloud computing.In November, Amazon picked America's financial and political capitals for massive new offices, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in both New York City and an area just outside Washington, D.C.

501,2019-01-09T09:52:20-0500,"Sears Holdings may need to shutter its business, ending the retailer's 126-year run, unless a bankruptcy court approves a buyout from Chairman Eddie Lampert.That's as Amazon just became the most valuable public company in the world.Sears has often been called the Amazon of its day.As bankrupt Sears Holdings inches toward liquidation, Amazon on Monday became the most valuable public company in the world, surpassing Microsoft.Many people consider Sears to have been the Amazon of its day. It was the so-called everything store. Shoppers could order items through Sears' print catalogs and later pick them up in stores, a service that many retailers are just now starting to incorporate with their websites today. In many ways, Sears set the bar for retailers such as Walmart and Target to follow. And it's those companies, including Amazon, that ultimately sped Sears' demise.Sears shares hit an all-time high of $195.18 in April 2007, when Amazon's stock was hovering around just $60. Over the years, Sears' market cap has tumbled from roughly $30 billion to under $100 million, as the company has struggled with sales declines and failed to invest in its stores. Meantime, Amazon's growth has accelerated as its online business has flourished.And — to Sears' detriment — Amazon has other valuable divisions outside of retail, like Amazon Web Services. In 2017, Amazon's total business reported $178 billion in sales compared with Sears' $16.7 billion. While Amazon doesn't break out retail sales, eMarketer estimated in July Amazon's e-commerce sales in the U.S. would amount to $258.2 billion in 2018.In September, Sears' stock breached the $1 mark for the first time, as Amazon shares had just hit $2,000. That was right before the department store chain filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Oct. 15. For the past few months, Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert has been trying to push through a bid that would salvage some of the company's remaining assets. Now, he has until 4 p.m. Wednesday to pay a $120 million deposit to allow for his deal — to keep 425 Sears and Kmart stores open — in play.Sears' fall has other retailers on alert, too.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon told CNBC last month he keeps a photo on his phone listing the top 10 retailers in the U.S. over the past few decades to remind him that so many companies come and go. That list included Sears in the No. 1 spot from 1950 through 1990, when Walmart overtook it.""You see the rise and fall of Sears and others,"" McMillon said. ""It's just a reminder that this can happen to us, too.""Amazon shares closed Tuesday at $1,656.58, bringing its market value to roughly $810 billion. It hit $1 trillion for the first time in September, but has since lost some value as tech stocks overall have been in a slump.One analyst said Amazon's stock should, easily, get back above $2,000 this year. Loop Capital Markets' Anthony Chukumba has a price target of $2,300 on Amazon shares, saying the company's moves into health care and more advertising will fuel its growth in 2019.WATCH: Eddie Lampert's bid to save Sears still alive"
502,2017-04-28T08:52:46-0400," Mixed reality is coming this year. Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system will allow us to step into digital environments You can work, watch movies and more, all in a virtual world with access to real Windows apps It's lonely, but it might help increase some worker morale At about noon on Thursday, I lowered a headset over my eyes and, for the first time in my life, stepped into Microsoft Windows.I was invited to attend an Acer event in New York where the company primarily discussed its VR and gaming ambitions. But I had one mission: to finally see what Microsoft's ""mixed reality"" experience is all about.What the heck is mixed reality?First, let's talk a bit about the differences between mixed reality, virtual reality and augmented reality.Virtual reality is what Oculus and Facebook are doing, allowing users to step out of this world and into another one. Augmented reality overlays the real world with additional information — which is what Microsoft is doing with HoloLens. Mixed reality is more like virtual reality in that you can't see your actual surroundings, but a bit like HoloLens in that you can interact with Microsoft apps and move around a digital space.I wasn't allowed to take any pictures of the experience, though I could snap photos of the headset. Here's what it was like.An apartment in the skyWhen I lowered the headset, I was suddenly standing in what appeared to be a ritzy, open apartment in the sky. In real life, I was just standing in a demo area wearing a plastic headset tethered to a laptop.A Microsoft representative handed me an Xbox One controller and told me to look around. Behind me was a large big screen TV hanging on the wall. Well, it looked like a TV, but in actuality it was a mixed reality version of Microsoft's video player software mounted on the wall, with a selection of clips to watch.I could, if I didn't have a real 70-inch TV in real life, use this headset and sit and watch a movie here. This digital player also supported 360 videos, so when I played one, I was suddenly transported to a first-person view, flying down a ski slope and able to look around in a complete 360 degrees.I was able to walk around my virtual reality apartment, too, visiting different displays on the walls. In what appeared to be a small sitting area, for example, were three other screens. I looked into the room, pressed a button on the Xbox controller, and was suddenly teleported. Here, I had one display showing the weather, another with Microsoft's Edge web browser, and yet a third digital monitor with access to email. It was a digital office of sorts, and I spent some time scrolling through NASA's website as if I was looking at a real computer screen.But why?Why do we want to take a virtual trip into Windows 10? Microsoft sees this as the next big step for operating systems. Plus, you could save some serious dough working in a digital office instead of a real one.I'd no longer need to buy three different monitors and a big screen display, for example, when I could simply buy a $300 Windows Mixed Reality headset and step into a world that already has all of that. The digital world I was in technically allows me to run any of the 20,000 universal windows apps that are already available, and the experience will run on most computers powered by Microsoft's latest Windows 10 Creator's Update software, which started rolling out this month.At home, on a rainy Saturday, I could teleport myself into the apartment in the sky, sit at my virtual desk and write an article in Word. I could move to the digital couch and watch an MLB game, maybe, or travel to a 360 degree view of Peru, all without ever actually leaving my apartment.I felt lonelyThere's something sad about this digital world. It's perfectly fine to spend the day at one's real desk, for example, and move to another real room to watch a game, maybe with a dog on your lap and your wife by your side. You don't get that here. You just have a virtual version of something that, perhaps, you wish you had in real life ... like that nice apartment in the sky.On the other hand, mixed reality could be a huge improvement for office workers. Instead of sitting in a cubicle under flickering commercial lights and staring at a single monitor all day, a worker could be transported to a whole new world with entertainment, multiple displays and even some virtual sunlight.That could be a game changer for boosting employee morale.Coming this yearThis is the new reality. Microsoft's partners, including Acer and Lenovo, are going to start selling mixed reality headsets this year. They'll cost a fraction of the price of virtual reality, starting around $300, and won't require the beefy gaming computers that virtual reality does.I'm not sure that office in the sky is for me. Maybe Microsoft needs to make different environments for its virtual version of Windows 10.A cabin in the woods for a writer, maybe?"
503,2017-04-28T17:26:28-0400," Google parent company Alphabet gained $22.75 billion in market cap on Friday At one point on Friday, the three companies had added $50 billion to their combined market caps, but pared gains late Alphabet and Amazon are in a race to stock prices of $1,000 Big tech didn't deliver on everything Wall Street wanted Thursday night — but that didn't stop investors from handing $27 billion to Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet combined.From the close of the market on Thursday to session highs on Friday, all three stocks hit an all-time high. That added more than $30.6 billion to Alphabet's Class A market capitalization, $14.2 billion to Amazon's market capitalization, and $6.7 billion to Microsoft's market cap, reaching about $52 billion. The stocks later pared gains, falling below their peaks. By the end of the day on Friday, the trio were just $27.4 billion richer, with Alphabet seeing $22.75 billion of those gains. Microsoft saw the smallest gain, since it missed quarterly revenue estimates when it reported $23.56 billion, just slightly below analysts' estimates of $23.62 billion.The gains left both Amazon and Alphabet closing in on share prices of $1,000. Amazon's market capitalization reached about $442.1 billion, according to FactSet, pushing founder Jeff Bezos' wealth closer to the richest in the world. Alphabet and Microsoft had market caps of about $636 billion and $529 billion, respectively, according to FactSet.The figures put big tech among the world's wealthiest companies — at least in the eyes of Wall Street, which often considers expectations of a company's future cash as much as its current sales, as Tesla's Elon Musk has pointed out.Tweet: Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows.Either way, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet aren't doing too bad: The three posted combined revenue of about $84 billion in the first quarter.  As a whole, the S&amp;P technology sector has outperformed sector so far this year, racking up sales even as consumer spending has been flattish overall.

504,2017-04-27T18:00:51-0400," The cloud-computing leaders reported quarterly earnings on Thursday. Amazon Web Services is winning with $3.66 billion in quarterly sales Microsoft Azure is speeding up, reporting 93 percent growth in the period. Amazon still owns the cloud. But earnings reports on Thursday from the e-retailer as well as rivals Microsoft and Alphabet show that the battle is in its early days and competition is fierce.In a rare confluence of events, all three companies reported quarterly results on the same day, giving investors an abundance of data on the state of cloud computing:Amazon Web Services is the clear leader and the only one of the three companies that provide a clean number for its cloud infrastructure business. Amazon said AWS revenue surged 43 percent in the quarter to $3.66 billion. Multiply that by four, and you get an annualized run rate of $14.6 billion.Microsoft wraps its Azure business into a division called Intelligent Cloud, which includes various other servers and cloud services. In total, that business grew 11 percent to $6.8 billion. While Microsoft doesn't break out Azure's revenue, it does offer up a growth number. In the quarter ended March, sales jumped 93 percent. Microsoft also said that its full Commercial Cloud business now has an annualized run rate of $15.2 billion, but that business also includes Office 365, not just the Azure infrastructure service. The Google Cloud Platform remains a laggard and is such a small portion of Alphabet that the company didn't even mention the business in its earnings release. Of Google's $24.5 billion in first-quarter revenue, $21.4 billion came from advertising. However, sales in the rest of the company jumped 50 percent to $3.1 billion, and a big part of that increase was clearly from new cloud-computing clients.With more corporations, government entities and non-profits downsizing their own data centers in favor of the massive infrastructure operations controlled by the tech giants, all three companies are racing to land major contracts and attract developers by building cutting-edge tools.""This space is an oligopoly,"" said Trip Miller, the founder of Gullane Capital Partners and an investor in Amazon. ""No one else of any meaningful size outside a handful of major players is getting into it because they can't afford to get into it.""AWS's fingerprints were all over Amazon's earnings report, with the acronym showing up 44 times.In addition to disclosing revenue and the unit's 24.3 percent operating margin, Amazon referred to a host of new AWS products like Amazon Chime for making online meetings easier and contact center technology called Amazon Connect. The company also said that AWS has regions opening up this year in France and China and that the cloud division ""collaborated with NASA to deliver the highest resolution video ever broadcast live from space.""According to Synergy Research Group, AWS controlled 40 percent of the public cloud services market as of early February, compared to 23 percent for Microsoft, IBM and Google combined."
505,2017-04-27T18:50:42-0400," Microsoft reported earnings that beat expectations, but revenue missed. The company's ""more personal computing"" segment missed Wall Street expectations as revenue from Surface products declined 25 percent. Azure notched another quarter of eye-popping revenue growth. Microsoft shares fell after the company said it reported lower-than-expected revenue, amid lighter volume of its Surface products.Here's how the company did in the fiscal third quarter compared with what the Street expected: EPS: 73 cents vs. 70 cents expected, according to Thomson Reuters consensus Revenue: $23.56 billion vs. $23.62 billion expected, according to Thomson Reuters consensus ""Intelligent cloud"" revenue: $6.76 billion vs. $6.60 billion expected, according to StreetAccount consensus ""More personal computing"" revenue: $8.84 billion vs. $9.22 billion expected, according to StreetAccount consensus The figure in the company's ""more personal computing"" segment represents a 7 percent decline from what it reported in the year-ago period. Microsoft said the decrease was primarily driven by lower phone revenue.Within the ""more personal computing"" segment, the company said it saw a 26 percent decrease in Surface, a line of tablets and computers.The stock fell as much as 3 percent in after-hours trading, but has since recovered its losses. It was last seen trading just slightly lower.Here's the company's outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter, compared to analyst forecasts:  Intelligent cloud revenue: $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion vs. $7.22 billion projected, according to StreetAccount consensus ""More personal computing"" revenue: $8.4 billion to $8.7 billion vs. $8.92 billion projected, according to StreetAccount consensus Robert Luna, CEO of Surevest Wealth Management, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" that the stock has had a ""tremendous run"" going into earnings. Shares of Microsoft hit a fresh all-time high of $68.31 on Wednesday. Luna said, however, he wouldn't necessarily sell the stock on these results because the company has a lot going for it, including its key cloud product, Azure.Azure, which competes with Amazon Web Services, nearly doubled its revenue growth again this quarter. Microsoft said the product saw sales growth of 93 percent.Growth in cloud revenue is seen as a key indicator of Microsoft's progress as the company transitions away from legacy businesses. In October, the stock broke through its 1999 highs after the company said Azure saw revenue growth of 116 percent.As of its Thursday close, the stock has surged more than 34 percent in the past 12 months.Disclosure: Surevest Wealth Management holds Microsoft for its clients.Watch: Pro advises patience with MSFT"
506,2017-04-27T11:16:43-0400," Credit Suisse initiates at Microsoft at outperform with $80 price target Microsoft reports quarterly earnings after the bell: Analysts expect total revenue of $23.62 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate Nearly $6.6 billion of that revenue is expected to come from ""intelligent cloud,"" according to FactSet Microsoft's cloud business is likely to unlock a powerful profit stream for the business over the next few years, according to analyst Michael Nemeroff. Nemeroff, a banker at Credit Suisse, wrote that Microsoft is in the early innings of its commercial cloud business, while Office 365 also has the potential for revenue and profit growth. He wrote that he expects Microsoft's cloud to continue growing at a pace of more than 50 percent revenue growth until 2018, and over 30 percent revenue growth through 2019. Profit margins are expected to grow to 60 percent by 2019, Nemeroff estimated.Microsoft's cloud services, Azure, currently leads the market, beat only by Amazon's Web Services as far as revenue. But Microsoft is closing that gap, he wrote, setting it up for "" significant earnings power potential over the next few years."" Microsoft has some advantages, Nemeroff said: It meets high standards as far as government and industry regulations, and is available in 34 regions, more than other cloud providers.  He set a target price of $80 a share for the stock, higher than the $70.55 average listed in FactSet.The research comes ahead of Microsoft's earnings report on Thursday after the bell, when analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to report total revenue of $23.62 billion. Nearly $6.6 billion of that revenue is expected to come from ""intelligent cloud,"" according to FactSet.Anand Eswaran, Microsoft's corporate vice president of services, told CNBC this week that Microsoft thinks about cloud differently than others in the industry, focusing on a complete pipeline that connects consumer products to businesses. For instance, he said, in collecting cloud data for a connected driving partnership with India's Tata Motors, Microsoft's salesforce found they were having trouble getting interest from millennials. As a result, they were able to incorporate Tata's brand into XBox games — something Eswaran said no other company could have done.Salesforce is another ""colossus of the cloud,""  Nemeroff wrote. The enterprise technology company is likely to gain share across multiple areas of the cloud business, according to Credit Suisse, thanks to cross-selling opportunities and keeping costs down."
507,2017-04-27T16:53:12-0400,"Microsoft just reported earnings for the quarter ended March 31, and the stock dipped about 1.5% on a slight revenue miss.The reason was a shortfall in the company's More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows and hardware like the Surface tablets, booked $8.84 billion in revenue — well behind average expectations of $9.22 billion (according to StreetAccount), and down 7% from last year. Surface revenue dropped 26% to $831 million, its lowest figure in more than a year, in part because of more competition from other similar devices and ahead of expected new models expected out later this year. On a call with CNBC, Microsoft said the shortfall was specifically due to ""lower than expected Surface Pro unit volume,"" but noted that one big reason for that product is to spur growth of similar ""2-in-1"" devices (combo tablet-laptops) across the entire industry.Microsoft said it was encouraged by sales of devices from other manufacturers — revenue from sales of Windows to other manufacturers was up 5% in constant currency, ahead of the overall PC market. Operating expenses jumped 12% from last year's quarter, to $8.4 billion, due in large part to the acquisition of LinkedIn. This was the first full quarter in which LinkedIn was part of Microsoft, and it drove $965 million in operating expenses, including $153 million in amortization of intangibles — a term that usually covers things like goodwill, trademarks, or brand value. The segment lost $386 million on $975 million in revenue during the quarter.Watch: LinkedIn brings $1B in revenue for MSFT"
508,2019-01-06T09:45:11-0500,"Apple might need a new growth story for investors to get excited about, and CEO Tim Cook hasn't closed the door on large acquisitions.Salesforce, Disney and Tesla are three options for Apple, according to a handful of Wall Street bankers.Still, it's unlikely Apple will do a large deal, they say, because it isn't in the company's DNA.Apple has a growth problem. With no game-changing product on the horizon (that we know of), it might finally make sense for Apple to acquire a company that can give it renewed life and change its Wall Street narrative.This would be highly unusual for Apple. More bluntly, it would be unprecedented. Apple ended the fourth-quarter with $237.1 billion in cash on hand and $130 billion in cash. Yet the company's largest acquisition ever was just $3 billion — its 2014 deal for Beats Electronics, the headphone-maker and streaming music company founded by rapper and producer Andre Young (Dr. Dre) and music executive Jimmy Iovine.The company has lost more than $450 billion in market value since Oct. 3. Slowing demand for iPhones and worse-than-expected sales in China led the company to lower its revenue forecast for the first quarter by as much as $9 billion. Shares fell the most in six years yesterday.Recently, CNBC asked a handful of Wall Street bankers if they thought Apple would finally make an acquisition of significance, given the company's recent woes. To a person, the answer was no. It's not in Apple's DNA, they said. There are too many cultural challenges with buying a large company for Apple, they said. Apple would get torched by the market for doing a big deal now after losing hundreds of billions in market value, they said.But, some said it feels like Apple should buy something — even if it probably won't. CEO Tim Cook told CNBC's Josh Lipton on Wednesday that the door on a large acquisition wasn't entirely shut.""We look at many, many companies including very large companies,"" Cook said. ""We've elected so far not to do those because we haven't found one that we say, 'wow, that's a nice intersection with Apple.' But I'd never rule it out.""So what would make sense for Apple? Here are some ideas from bankers.Apple isn't really in the enterprise software game. Buying Salesforce, known for its customer-relationship management cloud-based software, would change the narrative around Apple. The company would shift from being a consumer-focused hardware designer to a business-focused, software-as-a-service provider (as well as a consumer-focused hardware designer). That sounds a bit off-focus for Apple.But maybe off-focus is what Apple wants if it needs to sell a growth story for investors. Salesforce sales jumped 26 percent from a year earlier in its most recent quarter. Annual revenue topped $10 billion as company sales have consistently grown more than 20 percent each year. Salesforce has a market capitalization of more than $100 billion. Apple's current market valuation is about $700 billion. A deal would be a huge bet even for one of the world's largest companies.Apple sales are still growing — they were up 20 percent last quarter. But the downward revenue guidance could lead to diminished growth in 2019.And Apple has recently entered some partnerships with enterprise companies, including Cisco and IBM. Apple has a history of partnering before moving on its own. It worked with Motorola in 2005 to release the Rokr E1, the first iTunes phone, before launching the iPhone in 2007.Salesforce did flirt with selling to Microsoft back in 2015. But it was a much smaller company then, with a market capitalization of about $50 billion. It's unclear if Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff is still interested in selling, but any public company has to take an offer seriously.Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all in the enterprise software business. Those companies do a lot of other things too. A departure from Apple's core competencies might be rewarded by the market instead of shunned.Apple is going to launch a new digital video service this year, which will give its mobile device owners some free content and the right to buy subscriptions to existing media channels, similar to Amazon's Prime Video Channels, according to people familiar with the matter.But if Apple truly wants a leg-up in original content, buying Disney would be the biggest move it could make.Of course, Disney is trying to complete a $71 billion deal of its own (though that could be $30 billion less or more after selling its Sky stake to Comcast and divesting Fox's regional sports networks). And Disney already has an enterprise value of more than $180 billion. With a premium, that could make a deal the largest transaction of all time.Still, the ties between Apple and Disney go way back. Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was on the Disney board for years and was CEO of Pixar until he sold it to Disney. Apple's concerns about having family-friendly content for its video service jive with Disney's brand.If AT&amp;T was willing to spend $104 billion, including debt, on Time Warner, would Apple spend well over $200 billion for Disney? Apple did investigate buying Time Warner back in 2016, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Maybe it's just been waiting for the right time to pounce on Disney. And at 67, Bob Iger can't stay CEO forever.Then again, because of Apple's size, a deal for Disney could be a tough sell for regulators, even if the companies don't really compete. Antitrust lawyers are probably rooting for this option.While buying Disney would push Apple toward being the world's largest media company, acquiring Tesla is a cleaner fit in terms of staying closer to the company's core competencies — making beautiful, user-friendly devices and operating efficiently with complicated supply chains.Tesla followers are well aware of CEO Elon Musk's desire to be a private company. Selling to Apple would take the company out of the public markets.Apple has reportedly been working on an electric car project for years. A car could be just the new ""device"" Apple needs to make its fans go wild. I'm sure they'd find it wonderful to fantasize a 5G world where a luxury Apple car talks to your other Apple devices in blissful harmony.But would Musk be interested in running Tesla within Apple, when he's only the boss of a division? It's hard to imagine him giving up on the company.Tesla revenue more than doubled from a year ago, and though the company has flirted with liquidity problems, Apple's operational expertise and huge cash reserves could theoretically help the company fight its biggest problems, keeping up the pace of production with demand.Others have speculated about an Apple-Tesla deal before. Like Disney, Tesla's appeal would be jumping to the head-of-the-class through acquisition rather than building something from scratch. And Tesla would come cheaper than Salesforce and Disney, with a market valuation of just $54 billion.So Apple could probably just buy Tesla with its net cash.In other words, funding secured.WATCH: Tim Cook exclusive interview"

""Even with slowing revenue growth, BAC should continue improving efficiency metrics and, importantly, appears comparatively well positioned to withstand a turn in credit.""The analyst added that the firm now prefers Bank of America over J.P.

And the ""big 5"" technology companies — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon — were in the lead.Stock indexes have made broad gains since the election, and Nasdaq is no exception. In December, the Nasdaq topped 5,500 for the first time ever. The index notched new all-time high levels, at either the close or intraday, in January, February, March and April, rounding out its best quarter since 2013. Nasdaq Composite: up 11 percent so far this year, and nearly 22 percent over the past year Apple: up 24 percent so far this year and nearly 36 percent over the last 12 months Microsoft: up more than 8.5 percent so far this year and nearly 30 percent over the last 12 months Alphabet (Class A): up nearly 11 percent so far this year, and nearly 19 percent over the past 12 months Facebook: up 26 percent so far this year and about 31.5 percent over the past year Amazon: up 21 percent so far this year and more than 46 percent over the past year ""I have been a little bit surprised at the sheer magnitude of the strength,"" Joshua Spencer, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" on Monday. ""I think it reflects some of the fundamentals we see at these companies. If you look across the board, tech fundamentals have been very good in internet, software and semiconductors, so there's been a good backdrop.""While smaller companies exposed to President Donald Trump's agenda — like defense or infrastructure firms — saw early gains after the election, markets have gradually been moving toward bigger names, said Scott Kessler,  equity analyst at CFRA Research. Kessler said the rally among the biggest tech names is likely a combination of the companies' performance and a sense of overall enthusiasm in the stock market.""Are they leading because they are big, or are they big because they are leading? I kind of think there's a little of both,"" Kessler said. He added:  ""Part of it is these companies executing well, people are excited about what's to come. They allow investors to focus on the megatrends of what a lot of us are doing — virtual or augmented reality, self-driving cars — massive greenfields where companies are making tremendous investments."" Kessler's firm has a ""strong buy"" or ""buy"" rating on all of the ""big five"" except Microsoft, in part driven by the companies' earnings and revenues relative to their share prices.Apple's has recovered over the past year amid better iPhone sales and ""positive catalysts on the horizon,"" Kessler said, while Microsoft's LinkedIn acquisition and move away from mobile phones may be benefitting the stock. Companies like Google and Facebook are investing aggressively in what's next, Kessler said, as evidenced by Facebook's futuristic F8 conference last week.Companies like Amazon have also changed the relationship between companies and shareholders, NYU Professor Scott Galloway argued in a talk last week, by emphasizing ""fast growth and strong vision"" above profits.""In part because they are big, they can make these kinds of investments,"" Kessler said. ""The other subtext clearly is because they are the biggest, you get a disproportionate amount of passively allocated money, and there are benefits to that as well. ... I think these companies have done well by all accounts. People are encouraged by their results."" Trends like cloud computing, the growth of the internet, the penetration of tech into new areas are ""real tangible drivers"" that can drive results for the companies, said Spencer of  T. Rowe Price. Plus, the technology companies came out of the 2008 financial crisis better than many companies, thanks to consolidation during the dot-com bust, Spencer said.""I think it is a time to be a bit more selective with your stock-picking,"" Spencer said. ""The round numbers [like 6,000] are interesting of course, but the company by company stock prices are really what drive our performance...The last time [the Nasdaq] hit 5,000, back the tech bubble — coming out of that, I really think it was good for tech to go through that period. It really led to a lot of rationalization and companies being leaner."" — CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this reportWatch: Nasdaq hits intraday record"

Otherwise, how do you renew yourself? And in order to build a new concept, you need to build a new capability and that's where your culture can get in the way.  Under Nadella, Microsoft has made a monster bet on LinkedIn, and amped up its Surface line to near par with rival Apple. Less well known is its HoloLens project, a headset that is considered one of the frontrunners of so-called mixed reality technology. The product, which is billed as ""the first self-contained, holographic computer,"" marries Microsoft's gaming expertise with XBox with workplace productivity applications, like uses in healthcare and architecture. We hired silicon engineers many, many years ago, in order to now dream the dream that we can even create the assets able to do the holographic computing. That is capability building: having that foresight, forcing yourself to do things that are not the easy to do. It's not about the next day, the next quarter, next year. It's one of the fundamental challenges of leadership and you got to get it right: you can't be too far ahead, you can't be too far behind. To be able to yet see those corners is all it is about. Despite his success, Nadella is faced with a monumental task — keeping Microsoft ahead of rivals in hardware, gaming and cloud, while deepening its relationships with businesses. It comes after Nadella has admitted the company ""clearly missed the mobile phone."" Nadella told Business Insider that after the mobile phone, the next category of personal computing will be a ""fabric of devices.""

518,2017-05-24T00:15:36-0400," Pivotal Software could go public by mid-2018, sources say Pivotal's cloud business grew 130% on-year in 2016 Pivotal counts over a third of Fortune 100 companies as clients Enterprise software company Pivotal Software, which was spun out of EMC and its subsidiary, VMware, a few years ago, is looking at an initial public offering by the middle of next year, according to sources familiar with the matter. They did not give details on the size of the estimated float. The San Francisco-based company is an offshoot of software development consulting firm Pivotal Labs, which was previously acquired by EMC. Pivotal Software started with cloud technology from VMware, big data capabilities provided by EMC and a $105 million investment from General Electric.It is also backed by major names like Ford, which led a funding round along with Microsoft and others that valued Pivotal at $2.8 billion.When asked about the IPO, Pivotal CEO, Rob Mee, told CNBC, ""We'll definitely do it when the market conditions and the business conditions are just right.""Last year, VMware, EMC and Pivotal became subsidiaries of Dell Technologies.Pivotal helps companies build, test, deploy and update software applications that can run either on public cloud such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure or on private cloud.Mee said there is an emphasis on doing knowledge transfer at the firm that allows developers to continuously learn and that Pivotal does not hold anything back as competitive advantage.""Everything that we do is open-source ... in that mode of openness, now that we provide cloud technology as well, which we have built over the last four years, (the cloud business) has become a big growth engine for us,"" said Mee.Last year, the cloud business saw a 130 percent on-year increase, with its flagship software — Pivotal Cloud Foundry — selling over $270 million in annual bookings.Mee said he expects the business to grow again in 2017 because there is a realization among well-heeled legacy companies that they need to develop agile, cloud-based software to remain on par with their industry disruptors.For years, established companies have been on the defensive as they tackled threats from venture-backed start-ups, many of which created new markets for e-commerce, ride sharing, social networks and others, and reaped the commercial benefits.Industry experts say that cloud computing has become a crucial part of the business for most companies. Earlier this year, Gartner said the global public cloud services market is expected to grow 18 percent in 2017 to $246.8 billion, up from $209.2 billion in 2016, but may taper off over the next few years. Cloud application services are predicted to grow 20.1 percent to $46.3 billion this year.""The future for cloud is bright ... adoption will increase within the majority of organizations,"" Michael Warrilow, research vice president at Gartner, told CNBC. ""There is definitely a place for smaller companies to use big public cloud providers for their advantage.""Businesses are now thinking in terms of what Mee called a ""DevOps"" (Development Ops) mindset, where there's greater collaboration between software developers and information technology professionals to create cloud-focused solutions that can be modified quickly to change business needs.""Companies want a multi-cloud strategy,"" he said.Pivotal counts over a third of the Fortune 100 companies as clients, including six of the top automakers, seven of the largest banks and five major insurers in the world.Indeed, the firm addresses a pain point that consultants at PwC previously called the ""Goldilocks syndrome"", where changing regulations, productivity pressures and complex customer engagement models left businesses unsure how much to customize their software. Too much leaves a system expensive to maintain, while generic versions force firms to cram their business model into the software's function.""Software development is optimized for continuous change is essentially what it is,"" said Mee. ""Prior to that, software development had tried to limit change because it was seen as risky. It turns out that in order to move safely, you have to move much more quickly.""Pivotal has also expanded its presence Asia, and picked up key customers including Singapore's largest lender DBS Bank and Australian telco giant Telstra.Though legacy companies in the region have yet to face the same kind of disruption their counterparts in the U.S. have experienced, Lionel Lim, managing director for Asia Pacific and Japan at Pivotal, told CNBC that Pivotal's strategy in Asia is to go after the large customers first. ""Because they will be the ones that'll be hit first,"" he said.Mee added, ""The timing is really good for us to step up investment in Asia in a big way.""— CNBC's Anita Balakrishnan contributed to this report.

520,2017-04-11T13:44:03-0400,"Facebook is responding to the challenge from Snap in the classic way that tech companies try to face new competitors — by duplicating every core feature that made Snap popular, and then trying to crush it with distribution and marketing.According to a story published Tuesday in The Information (subscription required), Facebook created a ""Teens Team"" to figure out how to grab teenagers back from Snapchat, and has been up front about its tactics within the company: The internal mantra among some groups is ""don't be too proud to copy.""Unfortunately for Facebook, the track record for this strategy is poor.Flash back to the early 2000s, when Microsoft was the undisputed king of the tech industry, with two unassailable monopolies — operating systems and productivity apps for personal computers. It faced a lot of competitors, but the one that scared it the most was Google, which was in a completely different business. Google didn't start by creating alternatives to Windows and Office, although it did so later. Instead, it created a suite of online services — first search, followed by email and maps — that threatened the entire purpose of a personal computer. Why rely on Microsoft software running locally when you could get so much done with web apps?Microsoft's response? Trying to build the exact same service that made Google famous — a search engine, first known as MSN Search, later rebranded to Bing.Eleven years later, Bing is a small minority player in search, with less than 10 percent market share on the desktop and less than 1 percent in mobile, according to NetMarketShare. Google dominates with almost 80 percent share on the desktop and well over 90 percent in mobile. ""Google"" has become a verb. Nobody ""Bings"" anything.Bolstered by the massive margins in search advertising, Google has moved farther and farther into Microsoft's core territory, adding a massively successful mobile operating system (Android), web browser (Chrome), online productivity apps (Google for Work) and an increasingly robust cloud computing business. It also surpassed Microsoft in market cap for the first time in 2012, and remains ahead today.Google faced its own Bing moment in 2011, when it faced a challenge from then-upstart Facebook. The social network didn't threaten Google by building a better search engine. It did so by creating an entirely different online service, based around social networking and real identities, that drew people's attention away from search and other Google properties. As people spent more and more time on Facebook, advertisers followed.Google's response? To launch a competing social network based on real identities called Google+. It was just as successful as Bing — which is to say, not successful at all.Facebook may still win. After all, Microsoft used this playbook very effectively in the 1990s to eliminate the threat posed by Netscape Navigator — it built a better browser, then shipped it with Windows. It dominated web browsing for almost a decade (until Google came along with Chrome and Apple's iPhone introduced the concept of effective mobile web browsing).But Microsoft in the 1990s had an effective monopoly on personal computing platforms with Windows. If you wanted to go online, you had to go out of your way not to use Windows. The same is not true for Facebook — there are many ways to communicate and share information in real time with friends, including text messaging platforms like SMS and Apple's iMessage, and competing social networks like Twitter and — yes — Snapchat. Facebook will have to do more to regain teens' attention than simply duplicating every feature that made Snapchat popular. Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Snap."
521,2017-04-10T14:12:21-0400,"When Steve Ballmer was CEO of Microsoft, he once famously jumped around on stage at a conference sporting a sweat-drenched shirt and shouting one word repeatedly: developers! Ballmer's 14-year reign at the helm of the software company ended three years ago, in part because developers were going anywhere but Microsoft. Whether it was Apple and Android for creating mobile apps, Amazon Web Services for testing and running websites, or free open source technologies that were easy to deploy and customize, many programmers shunned Microsoft's old developer platforms in favor of shinier toys elsewhere.Since replacing Ballmer as CEO in early 2014, Satya Nadella has made it one of his primary goals to bring back developers. His latest move came Monday with Microsoft's acquisition of Deis, an open source tool that makes it easier for developers to build, run and move applications between on-premises machines and clouds from various providers. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.Microsoft's Azure cloud is a distant second to Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Nadella is racing to grab a bigger share of the market as companies rapidly move workloads out of their own data centers and into the cloud. Promoting emerging open source projects is critical to win business from developers who want the largest possible choice of software and platforms.""With all of the open source projects that are all the rage with developers, you have to have the offerings to cater to that if you want to attract them to your cloud,"" said John Vrionis, a partner at Silicon Valley venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners and an investor in enterprise software. ""If developers start in AWS and get comfortable, they're not going to even think about Azure.""Microsoft recently started working with Databricks to bring the start-up's data integration and analytics tools to Azure. Databricks, one of a few companies commercializing the open source Apache Spark framework, has to date only run in AWS. And late last year, Microsoft made the shocking decision to join the Linux Foundation as a platinum member, publicly supporting the open source platform that has long competed with Microsoft's flagship Windows operating system.This new emphasis on openness is not limited to Azure. A year ago, Microsoft spent $500 million on a company called Xamarin, whose software helps developers create apps across all major mobile platforms, which primarily means iOS and Android. Cloud is the big battle. That's where Microsoft's Windows servers, which have a big role in many companies' data centers, are being tossed aside as businesses offload their infrastructure. At the end of 2016, AWS controlled 40 percent of the cloud infrastructure market, while the next three players -- Microsoft, Google and IBM -- accounted for a combined 23 percent, according to Synergy Research Group.The acquisition of Deis pushes Microsoft deeper into the red hot container market. Containers let developers build code in a virtual box so it can be easily shared or moved between apps and across clouds. Scott Guthrie, the executive vice president for Microsoft's cloud and enterprise group, called containers ""the new currency in the cloud.""""At Microsoft, we've seen explosive growth in both interest and deployment of containerized workloads on Azure, and we're committed to ensuring Azure is the best place to run them,"" Guthrie wrote in a blog post on Monday.Deis promotes itself as ""making Kubernetes easy to use."" Kubernetes is an open source container technology developed at Google for deploying and scaling apps. Microsoft purchased Deis from Engine Yard, a company whose software is designed to make apps run smoothly in the cloud. "

We walked through a tour of some of those features in a first-look article that was published last week.Consumers who own Microsoft's Surface computers are going to benefit most from the update, since it adds powerful new functionality that's easier to use with a touchscreen and a stylus.Take, for example, a new Paint 3D application that lets you draw 2-D shapes and turn them into 3-D objects within seconds. There are new tools for developers to take advantage of other Microsoft hardware, too, like the company's Surface Dial.There's a little something for everyone in the update, though.The Microsoft Edge browser now supports the ability to bundle multiple tabs together and save them for later. If you're shopping for a new car, for example, and have multiple tabs open while viewing different models and prices, you can save that group of tabs and open them later.Gamers will find exciting new features, too. Microsoft is using its acquisition of Beam to allow gamers to quickly broadcast their matches. It's the company's take on Amazon's Twitch and YouTube gaming.

(Video: Yahoo agrees to test Google's Adsense)But hours later, the software giant appeared to trump Yahoo's announcement as The New York Times reported that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.was in talks to join Microsoft's $42.4 billion bid for the Web pioneer. ""We continue to believe (a Microsoft) deal is the most likely outcome,"" Citi analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a report, adding it would likely be priced higher than the initial $31-per-share bid from Microsoft in February.

Microsoft's cash-and-stock offer currently values Yahoo at about $29.45 per share. Until the Google/AOL news on Wednesday, Yahoo had appeared to be running out of alternatives to accepting Microsoft's takeover offer, with the software company threatening to lower its bid if it was not accepted within three weeks. But Yahoo is nearing a deal with Time Warner to fold AOL — excluding its legacy dial-up Internet access operations — into a combined company, sources familiar with the talks told Reuters. Such a deal would value AOL at $10 billion and Yahoo would get cash from Time Warner in exchange for 20 percent of the combined Yahoo-AOL. The Wall Street Journal reported that Yahoo would use the cash and other funds to buy back several billion dollars worth of Yahoo stock at a price somewhere in the middle of the range between $30 and $40 a share. ""In our view Yahoo management would have a difficult time convincing a majority of its shareholders this deal is worth more than Microsoft's offer,"" UBS analyst Heather Bellini wrote in a report. ""Even if shares were repurchased at $35-plus a share, the shares likely would pull back once the buyback is done."" As for a joint Microsoft-News Corp bid, that would create a more formidable competitor to Google by bringing together three of the biggest Web site publishers: Yahoo, Microsoft's MSN and News Corp's MySpace social network. But Bellini noted that while a tie-up could make sense, ""we think it would increase the integration risk and may not outweigh the decrease in financial risk."" Google is considered unlikely to enter the bidding directly as its growing dominance in Web search and search-based advertising could be blocked by competition regulators. But sources familiar with the talks said a two-week test on whether Yahoo can use Google to sell ads alongside Web search services could lead to a broader deal. Citi's Mahaney estimated a full search outsource could generate over $1 billion in incremental cash flow to Yahoo. Yahoo said the initial test with Google is small, covering only 3 percent of Web searches performed on Yahoo.com. Any of the combinations would fundamentally change the Web, as the first decade of growth has begun to slow dramatically. The talks with News Corp , which previously had discussed working with Yahoo as a counter to Microsoft's unsolicited bid, are at a sensitive stage, The New York Times said. Microsoft, News Corp, Time Warner, Google and Yahoo have all declined to comment on the talks."

A bear market is defined as a decline in a stock or index of 20 percent or more from recent highs.The e-commerce giant has ""finally reached an inflection point in which their top line, even though it's slowing, is growing at a faster rate than their fixed cost,"" he said on ""Squawk Alley."" ""So you're getting fixed-cost leverage.""On Monday, Amazon became the most valuable publicly traded company in the U.S. with a $797 billion market cap, taking the crown from Microsoft, which had taken the top spot in November after Apple fell from its lofty $1-trillion-plus valuation.Shares of Amazon was up more than 1 percent Tuesday and its valuation has climbed above $800 billion as of midday Tuesday.Chukumba also sees the health-care market as a ""big opportunity"" for Amazon disruption. The company made a number of moves in that $3.5 trillion sector last year, including launching its own employee health clinic in Seattle.He also thinks Amazon is likely to win the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure contract."

But the company, whose stock has been on a tear this week, already sells its graphics processing units to the biggest cloud companies to do just that.    What it means is that Nvidia plans to directly compete with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform.  Nvidia, a company that sells graphics cards for computers and other devices, Wednesday announced the launch of a cloud service for developers to train artificial intelligence models.But the company, whose stock has been on a tear this week, already sells technology to the biggest cloud companies — Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft — to do just that.What it means is that Nvidia plans to directly compete with Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform — to whom it now sells its graphics processing units for their cloud services. Those cloud services, in turn, provide GPU-backed virtual machine instances that developers use to run their AI workloads. The move could lead companies that need these services to forgo the biggest cloud companies and go directly to Nvidia. Naturally, those big cloud companies that are buying GPUs from Nvidia now aren't going to look favorably on this move, and will likely try to enhance their offerings or lower their prices.To be clear, Nvidia isn't building a whole cloud infrastructure from scratch. Instead it will rely on public cloud providers like AWS to run its service. But Nvidia will still be competing with those providers in this very particular space.The new service will become available in public beta in the third quarter, Nvidia said in a  blog post. Pricing information is not yet available.The Nvidia service will let developers use frameworks like CNTK (from Microsoft), MXNet (promoted by Amazon) or TensorFlow (from Alphabet) for ""deep learning,"" a type of AI that involves training artificial neural networks on lots of data and then getting them to make decisions based on that.Intel, the biggest U.S. chipmaker, has yet to introduce a similar service but could do so in the future.Yesterday Nvidia beat analysts' estimates for quarterly earnings per share and revenue.Watch: 4 things propelling Nvidia"

You might not have heard of it. Don't worry, you'll be an Arrow expert in just a few minutes.Arrow is an Android launcher, or a totally custom skin that changes how you interact with and use some of Android's home screen and main functions. Arrow was first developed and launched a couple of years ago by Microsoft Garage, a small part of the company that builds and launches experimental new products.

529,2017-03-29T09:00:00-0400,"Microsoft announced on Monday that the Windows 10 Creator's Update, announced earlier this year, will officially be available to download on April 11.This is Microsoft's latest attempt to go for Apple's throat and attack the core Mac user base of creative professionals -- as is made clear right in the name ""Creator's.""But while Microsoft is including a few compelling features, the update isn't going to send Mac fans running to Best Buy for a new laptop just yet. There's a new function named ""Paint 3D"" that allows you to draw a 2D image and convert it into a 3D shape, for example. The very fact it can accomplish such a complicated task in seconds is quite a feat, and it might be compelling for schools or for enthusiasts who have 3D printers. It's not going to appeal to most of Microsoft's user base, though, nor will it get people to switch away from macOS.Microsoft made a great change with its Edge browser, too. There's a new feature that lets you bundle tabs together and save them for opening at another time.Say you're planning a vacation, for example. Maybe you have tabs open for Expedia and United Airlines, various AirBnB tabs and more. You don't want those tabs running all of the time -- that'll take up too many resources. Just bunch them together in Edge and save them for when you're ready to book the trip. It's a feature I enjoyed, and it actually had me longing for it when I switched back to Google Chrome.Gamers, too, will like what they see in the Creator's Update. There's a new feature that allows your machine to dedicate every last bit of juice to gaming. There's also another feature that's a lot like Twitch, which lets you share your live game stream with other viewers, including friends who might want to tune in.The problem with these new additions, though, is that they're not really that exciting. Enthusiasts will care and may opt to download it on April 11. Most Windows 10 users, however, probably won't notice any of the changes.That's not going to help Microsoft.When Apple launched macOS Sierra, it made changes that affected most users -- not just gamers, 3D artists, the few folks who use Edge or those who have an expensive machine with a stylus and touchscreen.The Windows 10 Creators Update may succeed, if only because it's going to be available to all Windows 10 users. The only reason most folks will want to install it on day one is because it's always wise to stay on the latest version of Windows purely for security purposes.For something more exciting, you'll want to keep your eye out for Microsoft's ""Project Neon"" update. It was confirmed in February and should bring sweeping changes to the user interface. Microsoft hasn't discussed a public release date for that yet, though, which means the Creator's update will have to tide us over until then."
530,2017-03-21T05:48:24-0400,"Microsoft and Adobe Systems are joining to make their respective sales and marketing software products more potent competitors to Salesforce.com and Oracle offerings, the two firms said Monday.On the eve of San Jose, California-based Adobes annual user conference, the company said that it will work with Microsoft to create a shared data format between Adobes marketing software suite, which the company is re-naming its Experience Cloud, and Microsofts sales software, called Dynamics, allowing the software systems to work together seamlessly.Its going to enable to customers to go beyond the current (software) silos they have to navigate today, said Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of the cloud and enterprise division at Microsoft.For Adobe, best known among consumers for its Photoshop digital imaging and Acrobat PDF software, the partnership builds on a deal it struck with Microsoft last fall to use its Azure cloud computing services.Adobe has been pushing into business-to-business marketing software since it purchased Omniture Inc, a firm that helps website owners track their traffic, for $1.8 billion in 2009. Software that companies use to run digital marketing and advertising campaigns represented about $1.2 billion of Adobes $4.6 billion in revenue last year.For its part, Microsoft has been trying to expand Dynamics, its software system for sales people. Teaming with Adobe helps it compete more strongly against Salesforce and Oracle, which both offer a combination of sales and marketing software.Melissa Webster, an analyst with IDC, said that sharing data between systems to ensure customers get a smooth experience will be an important battleground in business-to-business software.If customers have spent a lot of money with a business, they expect the business to remember who they are and don't like it when they have to constantly re-enter their name and information, she said.Every time a company says with its body language Who are you, again? it eats into their brand equity a little bit, she said."

Microsoft beat out Salesforce to acquire Linkedin for $26.2 billion — by far the company's largest acquisition to date — in June. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff was so concerned, he accused the company of ""anti-competitive behavior"" and urged regulators to investigate.Flash-forward less than a year and Microsoft's new Sales Navigator Enterprise Edition incorporates many features aimed at turning LinkedIn into a must-have tool for sales teams at big companies.  Among other features, the new enterprise version increases the number of LinkedIn messages users can send to 50 per month, makes it easier for large companies to manage the product by adding single sign-on and allows sales teams to draw on LinkedIn connections from anyone within their organization with a new feature called TeamLink Extend.The Sales Navigator tool does integrate with Salesforce's CRM system, as well as Microsoft's competing Dynamics CRM. But it's also a clear indication of the synergies between LinkedIn, which has a massive database of information about professionals and their business relationships, and Microsoft's ambitions to target company sales forces with its products. Subscriptions will also include access to a tool called PointDrive, created by a company acquired by LinkedIn, for easily sharing content like presentations, images, links and videos with prospective customers. Pricing starts at $1,600 per seat per year, with the price dropping with more subscriptions and longer contracts.In the second quarter, Sales Navigator subscriptions increased 20 percent over the prior year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the company's most recent quarterly earnings conference call. Customers include SAP, Ernst &amp; Young, The Sacramento Kings, Symantec and PayPal. Nadella is quickly putting his acquisition dollars to work in other areas: LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman joined Microsoft's board, the company announced last week, to deepen its Silicon Valley ties and work on artificial intelligence.Correction: This story originally mischaracterized Sales Navigator. This story has also been updated to clarify that Sales Navigator integrates with Salesforce as well as Microsoft Dynamics CRM."

The company has shown a tendency to get a little too casual with how it promotes its services within Windows. You might even call these ""ads."" Microsoft would, of course, dispute that description. Some of these things that look very much like ads have started showing up in File Explorer. Specifically, Windows 10 has started nagging people to buy a subscription to OneDrive.More from Extreme Tech:Windows 10: The best hidden features, tips, and tricksNvidia, Microsoft announce new HGX-1 hyperscale GPU accelerator for AI workloadsMicrosoft plans convergence of PC, Xbox gaming, releases more details on Windows 10 Game ModeMicrosoft's OneDrive cloud storage service is built into Windows 10 and tied to your Microsoft account. Everyone gets 5GB of space free, but you can pay to get as much as 1TB for a single user. That also includes an Office 365 subscription. Depending on your needs, that might be a good deal. That does not necessarily mean you want to be made aware of said deal while browsing your files.The ad appears as a banner at the top of File Explorer, reminding you that OneDrive and Office 365 can be had for a mere $6.99 per month. You can take Microsoft up on the offer or dismiss it. It may just reappear at a later date, though. Some users reported seeing this a few months ago, but the incidence has ticked upward in the last week or so. This is not the first time Microsoft has crammed ads into the Windows UI — there are the  lock screen ads disguised as backgrounds,  notification ads for Edge, and a strange  pop-up ad for Microsoft's personal shopping assistant in Chrome.The OneDrive advert in File Explorer is much less subtle than some of Microsoft's past Windows promotions. It's also not controlled by the same option as other ads in Windows 10. If you want to disable this pop-up, go to View &gt; Options in File Explorer. Scroll down and turn off the option for ""Show sync provider notifications."" The drawback here is that you won't see any sync provider notifications, but if you don't use OneDrive, it shouldn't be an issue.It's odd that Microsoft has suddenly become so enamored with ads in Windows 10. Maybe it assumed we've all become so accustomed to ads on the internet that a few more in the OS won't bother us. However, people pay for Windows. Even if you got a free upgrade, you've probably paid for at least one Windows license on your PC. Putting ads on it seems mighty shady, Microsoft."

In a statement, Nissan said that Munoz had ""elected to resign"" from the company, effective immediately. It declined to offer details.He becomes the latest executive casualty since Nissan in November removed Ghosn as chairman and fired representative director Greg Kelly.The resignation deals another blow to the Japanese automaker which is grappling with the scandal at a time when it is struggling to shore up profitability in the United States and expand aggressively in China.Reuters had reported earlier on Friday that the Japanese automaker was looking into decisions made in the United States by Munoz who led Nissan's North American operations from 2016 to 2018.""Unfortunately, Nissan is currently involved in matters that have and will continue to divert its focus,"" Munoz said in his post.""As I have repeatedly and recently made clear to the company, I look forward to continuing to assist Nissan in its investigations.""People with knowledge of the issue have said that Munoz, who had been placed on a leave of absence earlier in the month, had not been co-operating with the internal investigation.Ghosn, once the most celebrated executives in the auto industry and the anchor of Nissan's alliance with Renault, remains in custody in a Tokyo detention centre since his initial arrest in late November.Ghosn has been indicted on two counts of under-reporting his income, and aggravated breach of trust for temporarily shifting personal investment losses worth 1.85 billion yen ($17 million) to Nissan.The scandal has sent shockwaves through the automotive industry and has escalated tensions between Nissan and Renault, where Ghosn remains CEO and chairman.Munoz joined the automaker in 2004 in Europe and led its significant expansion in North America after the global financial crisis. Since then, Nissan has succeeded in raising its market share in the United States and posted record sales.Earlier this year, Nissan tapped Munoz to oversee its operations in China where it plans to ramp up sales over the next few years.Since then, the world's largest auto market has been showing signs of a slowdown, prompting the automaker to cut local production plans in the coming months.

Amazon ended the frenzy by dividing the spoils between the two most powerful East Coast U.S. cities and offering a consolation prize of a 5,000-person center in Nashville, Tennessee, focused on technology and management for retail operations.Losers said they learned from the process, while winners said it was costly but worthwhile.""Either you are creating jobs or you are losing jobs,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo told a news conference on Tuesday.With more than 610,000 workers worldwide, Amazon is already one of the biggest employers in the United States and the world's third-most valuable company, behind Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp.Still, it faces fierce competition for talent from Alphabet Inc's Google and other companies working to build new technologies in the cloud. Those rivals routinely offer free food and perks in sunny California, seen by many as a better draw than Amazon's relative frugality in rain-plagued Seattle.

542,2017-03-04T14:22:36-0500,"Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes, considered one of the leading candidates for chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, has over the course of his campaigns received more than $60,000 in contributions from tech companies such as Facebook, Microsoft and Google.That means if President Donald Trump appoints Reyes to the FTC, there's a chance Reyes would have to recuse himself from cases involving those companies, according to a source close to the FTC. Other FTC experts said the federal agency had little or no experience in dealing with commissioners who have received campaign contributions and if that would put him under pressure to recuse himself from cases.More from Recode.net:  Uber's VP of product and growth Ed Baker has resigned   Headspace is putting its old CEO in charge of the company again   How Trump's FCC is quickly working to undo network neutrality It's still unclear if ethics regulations would apply in the case of campaign contributions, but experts say the issue for Reyes would come down to any appearance of conflict.As Utah's attorney general, Reyes reported $2.2 million in campaign contributions going back to his first campaign in 2012, according to the office of the Utah Lieutenant Governor. He received roughly $1.9 million of those donations between 2014 and 2016.Of contributions between 2014 and 2016, he received a total of $25,000 from Facebook, $15,000 from Comcast*, $7,200 from Microsoft, $3,000 from Yelp, $2,500 from Google and at least $10,000 from a batch of other tech companies, according to campaign finance disclosures.Google and Yelp declined to comment for this story. Comcast and Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment. Facebook directed Recode to its political engagement report.What makes this a potentially unusual circumstance for the FTC is it typically hasn't seen former politicians serving on the agency. If appointed, Reyes' past political life could complicate FTC cases going forward.Reyes' campaign consultant, Alan Crooks, told Recode, ""We haven't reviewed any of those things at this time,"" referring to the contributions from tech companies. ""We'll take a look at it if he's actually called to be FTC chair.""The FTC declined to comment for this story.The commission is one of two key federal institutions, alongside the Department of Justice, with the authority to pursue antitrust action against companies, making it a focal point in watching how the Trump administration handles regulatory policies and actions of significance to the tech industry.Reyes gained attention after sources told Politico he was a top candidate for the role of chairman of the commission. Acting chair Maureen Ohlhausen has also gained support as a possible permanent appointee. Both are Republicans.In recent years, lobbyists have aggressively pursued attorneys general with campaign contributions to act in favor of their corporate clients, according to a 2014 investigation in the New York Times. The draw is that attorneys general typically face fewer restrictions and disclosure requirements than other elected officials.A commissioner involved in cases pertaining to companies that contributed to his political campaigns would create ""an appearance of impropriety,"" a source close to the FTC told Recode.""The issue of running campaigns and the political contributions that are part of those campaigns presents some unique issues for the Federal Trade Commission in terms of recusals on the one hand, and in terms of appearances on the other hand,"" this person said.But another source, a Washington D.C. lawyer who used to work for the commission, told Recode campaign contributions are ""just part of the fabric of our political system."" The person pointed out that appointed roles at other federal institutions have been filled by former politicians. Hillary Clinton, for example, was appointed Secretary of State after serving as senator from New York.""Suggesting that there's a problem with this is really taking on the issue [of campaign contributions] generally,"" the source said.This isn't the first time questions have been raised about Reyes having an appearance of bias regarding tech companies.As attorney general, Reyes signed a letter a year ago suggesting the FTC revisit an investigation closed in 2013 into whether Google unfairly skewed search results to favor Google products. In the run-up to the nomination of an FTC chairman, companies engaged in conflicts with Google, including Yelp, have made efforts to promote his appointment, according to the Wall Street Journal.It should be noted that in addition to taking money from Google, Reyes has also taken money from Yelp, which has criticized Google for what it sees as anticompetitive practices.Whether Reyes would be pressured to recuse himself in cases involving companies that have contributed to his campaigns depends on an interpretation of the Code of Federal Regulations. The code's ethics standards for executive branch employees requires them to ""avoid an appearance of loss of impartiality"" in doing their jobs.Failure to avoid the appearance of bias could result in a court decision being tossed, according to Wayne State University law professor Stephen Calkins, who served as general counsel to the FTC in the late '90s. ""At some point an affected party could claim that due process rights were violated,"" he wrote in an email.In Reyes' case, if the rule applied, Calkins said it would likely involve a part of the code which he describes as ""vague, more general.""The line states: ""An employee who is concerned that circumstances other than those specifically described in this section would raise a question regarding his impartiality should use the process described in this section to determine whether he should or should not participate in a particular matter.""A previous FTC commissioner recently recused himself in cases involving Google, but for different reasons. Joshua Wright, who left the FTC in 2015, recused himself from matters involving Google because he had accepted funding from the company for some of his previous research papers. The Law and Economics Center at George Mason University, where Wright was a professor, received $762,000 in donations from Google from 2011 to 2013, according to Salon.But Wright's recusal likely stemmed from a different part of the federal code and may not apply to Reyes, according to Calkins.It's difficult to predict how ethics standards would be applied to Reyes because the FTC has rarely, if ever, had to consider ethics surrounding campaign contributions, Calkins said. Historically, it's rare for the commission to appoint members who have held elected office.Seattle University School of Law professor John Kirkwood, who worked for the FTC for 25 years, said he couldn't recall a single commissioner who had previously been an elected official. ""I doubt the FTC has much, if any, experience deciding whether a political contribution requires recusal,"" he wrote in an email to Recode.Calkins identified one commissioner who held a seat in Congress before joining the FTC — John Gwynne, who was appointed to the commission in 1953. Calkins did not look into earlier commissioners.Reyes has faced questions about the impact of campaign contributions on his actions as attorney general in Utah. In 2015, critics raised concerns about a $5,000 contribution Reyes received from contact lens company 1-800 Contacts, which benefited from a law he was defending.Reyes' campaign consultant Crooks told the Associated Press the contribution was consistent with past donations from the company, and that Reyes was required as attorney general to defend any laws passed in the state.The company, 1-800 Contacts, is currently fighting a lawsuit waged against it by the FTC alleging anticompetitive practices, as the New York Post previously reported.—By Tess Townsend, Re/code.net. CNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement."

""I'm focused on growing the top-line revenue and accelerating that business and its potential with ours,"" Hood said at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference. ""To add more customers. To increase their impact. To have it grow faster. To accelerate our business. To have the technical integration to deliver customer value.... I'm deeply, deeply focused on driving revenue growth.""While ""smart things will happen"" in the integration of the professional social network, Hood said she's not worrying LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner about whether the two companies can share an accounting team.  Like the story ""Fight Club,"" (where the first rule is ""you do not talk about fight club,""), Hood said her first rule of the LinkedIn integration is ""just don't mess with it."" ""You want to keep the core growing and they're doing a great job of that, things are good,"" Hood said. ""They are motivated, Jeff's a great leader."" Still, Hood said, the two companies do plan to leverage each other's sales forces in the integration, as Microsoft integrates LinkedIn into tools like Office 365. Despite her dedication to scaling LinkedIn, Hood said that Microsoft employees would probably say she's ""cheap"" when it comes to allocating cash. Hood said she focuses on return on investment, and she will shake down the couch cushions to invest in initiatives that drive revenue growth.""If you ask anybody at Microsoft, could they spend more money, all of them would say yes,"" Hood said. ""They should say that! They should say, 'Yes, I have so many terrific innovative, interesting, awesomely, impactful ideas, that you have to get me more money.' I love that, I love that energy, and I listen to some really fascinating arguments ....then my job is to take those dollars, every one of them, and ask myself if we're putting it in the right place."" In her wide-ranging talk, Hood also discussed Microsoft's cloud business and tax plans. While Google, Amazon and Microsoft are considered the leading cloud services providers, Hood said she wouldn't count out companies like IBM and Alibaba. ""I think the IBM cloud gets a lot of mention with very large customers, you see that those in the press,"" Hood said. Hood also said that while Microsoft has long advocated for structured tax reform, CEO Satya Nadella is still waiting and watching to see exactly what new administration will propose. ""I know we've not been a company to until to wait on tax reform to return capital,"" Hood said. ""It's not been a reason to wait for the board or for Satya, who cares deeply about the topic."""

There are multiple designs of the toilet but all work by separating liquid and solid waste.""The current toilet simply sends the waste away in the water, whereas these toilets don't have the sewer. They take both the liquids and solids and do chemical work on it, including burning it in most cases,"" Gates told Reuters.He compared the change from traditional toilets to waterless models as similar to development in computing around the time he founded Microsoft in the mid-1970s.""In the way that a personal computer is sort of self contained, not a gigantic thing, we can do this chemical processing at the household level,"" he said.KICKING TYRESPoor sanitation kills half a million children under the age of five annually and costs the globe over $200 billion a year in healthcare costs and lost income, according to the foundation.Gates' foundation has committed roughly $200 million to the toilet project and expects to spend the same amount again before the toilets are viable for wide-scale distribution.""This year the volume of toilets will literally be in the 100s while people are still kicking tyres (testing them),"" Gates said.During a speech at the Beijing event, Gates held up a clear jar of human faeces to illustrate the importance of improving sanitation.""It's a good reminder that in (the jar) there could be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 20 billion Shigella bacteria, and 100,000 parasitic worm eggs.""It is the first time Gates' foundation has addressed an event in China, where President Xi Jinping is promoting a three-year ""toilet revolution"" to build or upgrade 64,000 public toilets by 2020 to help boost tourism and economic growth.Gates said the next step for the project is to pitch the concept to manufacturers, saying he expects the market for the toilets to be over $6 billion by 2030.China is taking a bigger role in global aid alongside its huge infrastructure investments in developing countries as part of its cornerstone foreign policy initiative, Belt and Road.That comes as U.S. President Donald Trump considers cutting foreign aid amid a wider push to pull back from foreign commitments - an area which has contributed to Sino-U.S. trade tension.Gates said it would be a mistake for the United States to cut aid.""It's not a huge part of the budget but the impact is gigantic,"" he said.

Under the ""code of practice"", Bing and Google have agreed to remove links to infringing content from the first page of results.The voluntary agreement was brokered by the U.K. Intellectual Property Office (IPO), the government department that deals with patents and copyright issues, who called it a ""landmark"" deal.Search engines, in particular Google, have clashed in recent times with organizations that represent rights holders about how best to tackle pirated content. Even Google's YouTube has come under fire from the music industry over copyright in the past.""Consumers are increasingly heading online for music, films, e-books, and a wide variety of other content. It is essential that they are presented with links to legitimate websites and services, not provided with links to pirate sites,"" Jo Johnson, U.K. minister of state for universities, science, research and innovation, said in a press release on Monday.The BPI (British Phonographic Industry), which represents the U.K.'s recorded music industry, and the Motion Picture Association are also part of the agreement.Both Bing and Google currently allow copyright owners across the globe to make a request for the removal of a link. In the past 12 months, Google has taken down 915 million links following requests from copyright holders. Bing took down over 91 million links between January and June 2016, according to a Microsoft transparency report.The code was agreed on February 9 and will come into force immediately. It sets targets for reducing the visibility of infringing content in search results by June 1, 2017."
549,2017-02-19T23:51:02-0500,"Companies hoping to adopt new technologies for long-term growth should embrace cloud computing, according to a top Microsoft executive.Ralph Haupter, president of Asia at Microsoft, told CNBC on Monday that decision-makers in the region were looking for ways to digitally transform their businesses to tap into new technologies like artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, mixed reality and wearable devices.""Cloud is the how in 'how to do it,'"" Haupter said.In a study released by Microsoft on Monday, 78 percent of Asia Pacific decision-makers surveyed said cloud computing was crucial in their digital transformation strategy.The findings of the company's Asia Digital Transformation Study also showed 80 percent of the 1,494 respondents across the region saw the need for digital transformation as a long-term growth strategy but only 29 percent have thorough plans in place to do it.The demand for public cloud services in Asia Pacific is expected to grow 17.7 percent in 2017 to $10 billion, according to research from Gartner. By 2020, total public cloud services spending in the region will rise to $15.8 billion.Microsoft underwent its own business transformation from a desktop focus to more emphasis on cloud and mobile, and now has data centers in 13 regions across Asia Pacific to cater to the growing demand in public cloud services in local markets. These centers support Microsoft's public cloud, Azure, which grew revenue by 93 percent on-year in 2016 and saw compute usage more than double. To navigate the complexities of regulatory compliance and data privacy laws around the region, Microsoft also partners with other data center providers already established in local markets. In China, that partnership is done with U.S.-listed 21Vianet, with data centers running in Beijing and Shanghai. ""China obviously is a huge opportunity that's defined by size (and) acceleration of innovation...you have, by definition, high demand and digitization,"" Haupter said, adding that many government initiatives were betting heavily on technology.Many U.S. technology companies have encountered difficulties operating in China, frequently drawing censorship from the government. On the other hand, Microsoft announced a Transparency Center in Beijing last year, where tech experts from the government can test and analyze the company's offerings closely before deployment. For context, Microsoft said in a blog post: ""Simply put, governments have the ability to review our products and services, both manually and by running tools, but they cannot alter what is delivered to customers.""Haupter, who was previously the chief executive officer of Microsoft's Greater China Region and was based in Beijing, said the Chinese government is interested in developing a regulatory framework. Officials, he said, were looking for companies that focused on addressing specific innovation needs in the local provinces in sectors like education, banking and technical training. When asked about the complicated relationship between China and President Donald Trump's administration, Haupter said Microsoft was focused on understanding — and complying with — local regulations both in the U.S. and China. ""On top of that, we focus on customer value. Customers want to have innovative solutions, focus on growth and focus on optimizing their business and they want to play globally,"" he said. — CNBC's Harriet Taylor contributed to this report. "

The ruling is a crucial early hurdle for Microsoft's case, which argues that the government's gag-ordered searches of Microsoft accounts violates the constitutional right to free speech.""Microsoft brings this case because its customers have a right to know when the government obtains a warrant to read their emails, and because Microsoft has a right to tell them,"" the company argued in its initial complaint.In the same ruling, the judge declined to uphold Microsoft's Fourth Amendment case against the gag-ordered searches, finding that the precedent involved was too significant to be overturned at the district level.More from The Verge: The Hawai'ian volcano that created a spectacular firehose of lava just collapsed Apple, Facebook, Google, and 94 others file opposition to Trump's immigration ban Google's Super Bowl ad accidentally set off a lot of Google HomesThe case comes at the same time as a similar suit brought by Twitter, which seeks to disclose more data on the number of National Security Letters sent to the company.

552,2014-04-01T15:23:50-0400,"Microsoft is following through on a promise to update its Windows 8 operating system on a regular basis to respond to consumers' complaints and other feedback.Just months after the release of Windows 8.1, Microsoft is preparing changes to make it easier for people to use Windows with traditional keyboard and mouse controls. Among other things, Microsoft will add search, power and settings buttons to the Start page, so people don't have to figure out how to pull those functions from the right side of their screens. The update also promises easier ways to close apps.Microsoft Corp. outlined some of the new features at a February conference in Barcelona, Spain, and will likely provide more details Wednesday as the company opens its annual Build software developers conference in San Francisco.The new, yet-unnamed update is expected soon. It follows the October debut of Windows 8.1, which came just a year after the release of Windows 8. The pattern contrasts with Microsoft's past habit of waiting years to release major updates.Microsoft is also updating its Windows Phone system to work better in corporate environments. The company will add VPN support, for instance, to allow phones to connect with corporate networks securely. There will also be features that consumers in fast-growing emerging markets desire, including the ability for phones to have two SIM cards so people can switch carrier plans easily for the best deals.  The company hasn't announced pricing or specific availability for either update, but both are likely to be free downloads, based on past practice. They could be available as early as this month and will be among the first major software releases since Satya Nadella became Microsoft's CEO in February. It follows Nadella's unveiling last week of Word, Excel and PowerPoint apps for Apple's iPad.   Microsoft may also use the Build conference to update software developers on the company's plans to integrate the Windows Phone 8 system for smartphones, the Windows 8.1 system for tablets, laptops and desktops and the Xbox system for its game console. The company has said it is working to have its various systems share more of the underlying code, while retaining separate interfaces adapted to the specific devices. The integration will make it easier for developers to adapt apps for the various devices.   Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., saw lackluster demand when Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 came out in October 2012.   Windows 8 was supposed to be Microsoft's answer to the growing popularity of touch-screen devices such as smartphones and tablets. Instead, research firm IDC blamed Windows 8 for accelerating a decline in global PC shipments, which fell 14 percent in the first three months of 2013, the first full quarter with Windows 8. Designed as a single system to unify tablets, laptops and desktop PCs, Windows 8 emphasizes touch-screen controls and sports a full-page home screen that is more common on mobile gadgets than traditional computers. Many consumers, however, hate that approach on laptops and desktops.  Last October, Microsoft issued a free update to address some of the gripes. Now, people can run more than two apps side by side. The built-in browser lets people open more than 10 tabs without automatically closing older ones. Windows 8.1 also introduced new features, including a universal search function to help users find files stored on their computers along with Web content on the Internet.   At the time of the release, Microsoft promised to issue new features regularly.   The latest update will do just that. Microsoft has said the company is standing by its decision to embrace touch controls, while acknowledging that many of the remaining Windows gripes have come from people who use non-touch devices.   Meanwhile, Windows Phone 8 came out with a thud some 17 months ago. One of its biggest drawbacks has been a lack of apps available for the system, compared with Apple's iOS and Google's Android. Microsoft is starting to catch up on that front. It has also updated Windows Phone 8 three times since its release to add features. The upcoming update is poised to be the biggest of them all and might get a new name, Windows Phone 8.1.   The release comes as Microsoft prepares to buy Nokia's phone business and patent rights in a 5.4 billion euro ($7.4 billion) deal. The transaction should be completed in the next few weeks, pending regulatory approval in Asia. The deal already has approval in the U.S. and Europe. "

Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson filed a lawsuit today against Trump's order, which bars legal immigrants and refugees from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the U.S. and bans Syrian refugees indefinitely.  Now, at least three tech companies — Microsoft, Amazon, and Expedia — are joining that legal fight. A Microsoft spokesman told Reuters that the company is providing information about the effect of the order in order to ""be supportive."" They also would ""be happy to testify further if needed.""   Both Amazon and Expedia are also preparing statements that demonstrate the order's negative impact on their business. In an email to employees, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos wrote that the company's legal team ""has prepared a declaration of support for the Washington State Attorney General who will be filing suit against the order."" They are considering other legal options, as well. Expedia hasn't publicly released its statement but Ferguson cited the company's help in a press release.

Other tech company executives, ranging from Tesla CEO Elon Musk to Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg, have spoken out against the order. Yet only Amazon, Microsoft, and Expedia — all of which are based in the Seattle area in Washington — are in a position to support this particular legal challenge to the immigration ban, at least until more lawsuits begin popping up around the country.

Legg, which disclosed it owns 60.7 million shares of Yahoo, or 4.4 percent of outstanding shares, urged Yahoo and Icahn to settle their differences ahead of Yahoo's August 1 shareholders meeting. The firm's portfolio manager Bill Miller told Reuters last week Icahn would have more support if he promised not to sell Yahoo below $33 per share. He also urged Microsoft Corp to make its offer public. ""If Microsoft wants to acquire Yahoo, it can make the terms and conditions of its offer public,"" Legg said in a statement. ""If Yahoo shareholders support it, I am confident the board of Yahoo will accept it."" Legg backed Yahoo's actions since Microsoft made its $47.5 billion offer to buy Yahoo public earlier this year. ""We believe the current board acted with care and diligence when evaluating Microsoft's offers,"" Legg Mason said in a statement.

Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo earlier this year for $47.5 billion, but withdrew its offer in May after feeling frustrated over discussions.""In six months, (Microsoft) will walk away,"" Murdoch said at the annual Allen media and technology moguls confab.News Corp has reportedly been on the sidelines of recent discussions involving Yahoo.Shortly after Microsoft offered to take over Yahoo, News Corp held talks with Yahoo to combine its popular MySpace Internet social network with Yahoo and separately discussed a possible deal with Microsoft to take over Yahoo.Murdoch said one of Yahoo's biggest investors Capital Research, whose portfolio manager and legendary media insider Gordon Crawford publicly chastised Yahoo for failing to secure a Microsoft deal, would have gladly settled for a buyout at $33 per share.""He's pissed he didn't get $33,"" Murdoch said of Crawford.Would Crawford have backed a deal to sell Yahoo for $33 a share?

""That's really not the most interesting part,"" Vleeschhouwer said.   ""It is the fundamental applications, the functions, that you can do as a business, as a consumer, that are not being delivered in a new way and paid for in a new way,""    Azure's added revenue also helped Microsoft balance its slipping phone and device sales, Vleeschhouwer said.   ""Total revenues beat, even with some substantial drag,"" he said. ""For example, the phone business, which they probably should have never bought in the first place, was far more of a decline. But notwithstanding that, the more important business having to do with software [and] cloud services, exceeded expectations.""

The company said revenue from its major cloud offering, Azure, grew 93 percent year over year.   Growth in cloud revenue is seen as a key indicator of Microsoft's progress as the company transitions away from legacy businesses. In October, the stock broke through its 1999 highs after the company said Azure saw revenue growth of 116 percent.   CEO Satya Nadella said Microsoft customers are ""greater value and opportunity as we partner with them through their digital transformation.""   ""Accelerating advancements in AI across our platforms and services will provide further opportunity to drive growth in the Microsoft Cloud,"" Nadella said in a statement.   On Thursday, the stock initially dropped about 1 percent in after-hours trading, but then reversed those losses to trade as much as 1 percent higher. It was last about flat in extended trading.   The company posted second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 83 cents on revenue of $26.07 billion. Analysts projected Microsoft to report earnings of 79 cents a share on $25.3 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates.   Earlier Thursday, Microsoft shares hit a fresh all-time intraday high of $64.54. The stock is up 23 percent in the past 12 months.   The Street also expects Microsoft to formally announce 700 job cuts as part of its previously announced plan to cut 2,850 jobs by June 2017.  The company also completed its $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn on Dec. 8. This is breaking news. Please check back for updates. "
561,2019-01-03T09:12:39-0500,"Cloudera's merger with rival Hortonworks closed on Thursday.Shares of both companies have plunged since the deal was announced in October.The combination required the establishment of 11 integration groups and a new leadership team.Cloudera and Hortonworks were bleeding cash as the two data software providers spent years going head-to-head to lure businesses onto their fledgling technology. As of Thursday, they can join forces against a common enemy: Amazon.The all-stock deal unites the two most prominent vendors of Hadoop open-source software, which customers can use to store, process and analyze many different types of data. Valued at $5.2 billion when the merger was announced in October, the companies are worth just a combined $3 billion as of its official close.The stocks plunged in the fourth quarter amid the market sell-off and specific concerns about whether Cloudera — the name of the combined entity — has a compelling enough story to take on Amazon Web Services. For all of 2018, a year that was a boon for many cloud stocks, Cloudera shares fell 33 percent and Hortonworks dropped 29 percent.""The big competitor for us is Amazon, with their house offerings,"" Cloudera CEO Tom Reilly told CNBC in an interview last month, in preparation of the deal's closure. ""We're gearing up to take on Amazon.""The Cloudera-Hortonworks merger fit into a big technology theme in 2018 — the growth of open source. IBM bought Red Hat for $34 billion, Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion and Salesforce purchased MuleSoft for $6.5 billion. Elastic, whose software helps companies embed search functions in their apps, had one of the bigger IPOs of the year and is now valued at about $5 billion.They all are keeping a close eye on AWS. The leader in cloud infrastructure has successfully pulled companies' core workloads into its data centers and is now adding new features, functions and services that are easy to use once a business is already on Amazon's machines.Cloudera is particularly at risk because Amazon has been investing heavily in databases. AWS' competitive products include Elastic MapReduce, for storing and processing different data types, and Redshift, a data warehouse system. Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at at D.A. Davidson, estimates that EMR generated about $250 million in revenue in 2018, while Redshift reached about $400 million, a small fraction of the $25.5 billion AWS is expected to report for the year, according to analysts polled by FactSet.At the time of the Cloudera-Hortonworks deal, the companies said they would have combined annual revenue of $720 million and that they expected 2020 revenue to exceed $1 billion.The beefed-up Cloudera has certain strengths as it stares down Amazon. Reilly said Cloudera is the standard-bearer for companies that want to use Hadoop because it's independent and has a clear open-source model.Cloudera also works in corporate data centers and across multiple clouds. For years AWS focused exclusively on delivering software to companies from its own remote data centers, and it only recently announced servers that will be able to run Amazon software inside of other companies' existing data centers. Unlike Cloudera, AWS doesn't have a way to let companies use many of its software products on clouds operated by Microsoft or Google.""Amazon will never be able to deliver multi-cloud,"" said Reilly, who has run Cloudera since 2013 and took it public in 2017.An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.Deploying Cloudera's software in the cloud is becoming more commonplace. As of June, 26 percent of customers that provide diagnostic information to the company are using the software on a public cloud like Amazon, up from 22 percent one year earlier.A big advantage for the new Cloudera is it no longer has to spend money taking on Hortonworks, and vice-versa. Cloudera lost $111 million in its previous three quarters, and Hortonworks reported a $114.8 million loss over that stretch. Together, they spent more than 55 percent of revenue on sales and marketing.Reilly said that by becoming more efficient in sales as well as research and development, within a year Cloudera should have a 15 percent operating cash flow margin, a key measure of profitability.""Neither of us are at that point right now,"" he said.In addition to Amazon, Cloudera has to contend with emerging companies like Databricks and Snowflake.""The combined entity is better positioned to compete against those players,"" D.A. Davidson's Jaluria, who has a buy rating on Cloudera, wrote in an email.While the merger makes smart business sense, there are challenges in pulling together staffs from two companies that were bitter rivals. Reilly said it was hard to build a leadership team with executives from the two sides.""You have the loyalties,"" he said. ""You have the people you know.""The unification with Hortonworks involved putting together 11 ""functional integration teams"" with employees from both businesses. The work is wrapping up ahead of schedule, Reilly said.One thing Cloudera hasn't ruled out is imposing software-licensing changes that could help protect it from larger cloud providers like Amazon. MongoDB, Redis Labs and Confluent all took steps last year to limit what others could do with their software.Heather Meeker, a lawyer with software licensing experience and a portfolio partner at OSS Capital, said she expects more companies involved with open-source projects to introduce constraints.""At the end of the day, I think all of these companies are trying to make sure they don't get starved for resources when there are a bunch of big users benefiting from what they're doing, but they're just going down different routes,"" Meeker said.Reilly said Cloudera doesn't have plans to tweak the licenses for any of its 26 open-source projects, including the core Apache Hadoop technology. But that could change.""There are so many different views on this,"" Reilly said. ""We believe that open source is the way to drive innovation and drive standards. We believe some of the cloud players are good about participating in the open-source community. Others are not.""Amazon's track record in that area is poor, Reilly said.WATCH: Cloudera CEO: We became more targeted with sales using our own data"
562,2017-01-25T19:31:18-0500,"  The protectionist policies of President Donald Trump will be bad for technology companies, Roger McNamee, co-founder of venture capital firm Elevation Partners, told CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on Wednesday.    The new administration's America-first message may damage domestic tech companies' access to foreign markets and resources, particularly in China, he said.   ""Our relationship with China is going to change radically and it doesn't look like it's going to get better,"" McNamee said.   Most unsettling to the investor is the potential destruction of global partnerships that have been built up over the past 70 years. Trump is trying to dismantle the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), an agreement between the U.S. and 11 other countries, among other trade partnerships.   ""If we lose the TPP one of the levers of protecting American companies will go away,"" he said.     ""Trump favors nationalism, which is inherently more pessimistic, and when it follows globalism inevitably it has to lead to a shrinkage in demand, and less gross domestic product around the world,"" McNamee added.    Though the short-term trends in the market are great for traders — the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 20,000 for the first time on Wednesday — the long-term outlook is more grim, he said.   When asked to pick between Alphabet or Microsoft, which are both reporting earnings this week, McNamee said he prefers Microsoft in the near term and Alphabet looking into the future, though he doesn't own either stock. McNamee's major holdings are Facebook, Apple, Alibaba, Yelp, Amazon, eBay and PayPal.   Still, both Alphabet and Microsoft are potential victims of the shift to Trump's nationalist proposals, he said.    ""Antitrust policy will be one of the tools that other countries use to punish us if we do policies they don't like, and I think Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft are all in the crosshairs on that,"" he said.

563,2017-01-26T19:27:37-0500,"Devices at Microsoft are a rapidly deteriorating business. Except for one bright spot.Sales of Surface tablets and computers increased 11 percent $223 million in the fiscal second quarter, Microsoft reported on  Thursday. Meanwhile, phone sales plunged 76 percent, and devices as a whole dropped 35 percent to $1.4 billion in revenue.""I am excited about the customer reception to Surface Studio, our latest innovation in the Surface line and a new device category,"" said CEO Satya Nadella on the company's earnings conference call. ""Demand for the devices has remained strong."" The mobile market has long been a struggle for Microsoft, with consumers preferring Apple's iPhones and Google-powered Android devices. Mobile market share for Windows sank to 0.3 percent as of November, according to IDC.That makes the Surface even more important for Microsoft as PC shipments continue to fall. Along with increasing Surface revenue, Microsoft also reduced its sales and marketing spending associated with Surface, phones and Windows 10 by 13 percent over the prior year. One big Surface customer got a shout out from Nadella. Her Majesty Revenue and Customs, the UK's tax and payments authority, rolled out Surface devices to more than 25,000 employees, he said. Still, not all analysts were thrilled with the numbers. Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, said he was expecting closer to 25 percent growth in Surface sales and attributed the shortfall to constrained supply of the high-end Surface Studio and limited enhancements to other products in the family.Here are all the details on Microsoft's earnings report. "
564,2017-01-25T10:03:00-0500,"  Wall Street expects Microsoft to report solid earnings and continued cloud growth when it reports quarterly results after the close of trading Thursday.   Analysts expect the world's biggest software company to post earnings of 79 cents per share on revenue of $25.28 billion for the December quarter, according to Thomson Reuters.    Investors are particularly focused on how fast Microsoft is growing its higher margin cloud offerings — including cloud computing platform Azure and its web-based suite of productivity programs Office 365 — while controlling costs.   ""It all boils down to is the Azure business growing and growing profitably,"" said Stifel analyst Brad Reback. ""If Azure is the growth engine we think it is and can pick up market share from AWS, then the company is well positioned for the next couple of decades.""  (Reback has a Buy rating on the stock and a $66 price target.)   Microsoft began reporting commercial cloud gross margins for the first time last quarter — to add more transparency to its business — and this metric will continue to be important to investors, he said. Last quarter, Microsoft reported a commercial cloud gross margin 49 percent, up from 42 percent in the prior quarter.  Though Amazon's AWS is clearly in the lead today, Microsoft's Azure is quickly closing the gap, said PiperJaffray analyst Alex Zukin. Azure's core functions are finally comparable to AWS's and Microsoft's customer support, existing relationships and contract flexibility make Azure particularly appealing to many businesses, he said. Azure is doing well in the retail sector as retailers are wary of sharing their data with Amazon or funding a competitor, he said.  ""This is an extremely large market and its turning into a duopoly where the majority of vendors are going to pick AWS or Azure,"" he said. Zurkin rates the stock a ""Buy"" with an $80 price target.   The company is also expected to announce job cuts as part of a previously announced plan to cut 2,850 jobs by June 2017. The December quarter was the last quarter to suffer ""meaningful overhang"" from the Nokia deal Microsoft has been working to unwind, said Reback.    With so many moving parts of the business, analysts will be listening closely for commentary and any additional metrics executives may share on the earnings conference call on Thursday at 2.30 p.m. Pacific.    Analysts expect Microsoft to return to robust revenue growth — reversing two years of declines — next quarter. That's also when the company will begin to fold in LinkedIn's contribution to its earnings, after closing the deal to acquire the company for $26.2 billion on December 8, 2016.Analysts credit CEO Satya Nadella for leading the company through its transition from legacy businesses to new high growth cloud businesses. Most analysts who cover the stock — 69 percent — recommend buying it, according to data compiled by Factset.   ""He's done a phenomenal job — think about the sentiment now versus four years ago — it's astounding,"" said Reback ""It's like [Louis] Gerstner's turnaround of IBM without the near-death experience."" "
565,2017-01-24T12:43:10-0500,"  Pacific Crest on Tuesday predicted Microsoft would exceed earnings estimates from Wall Street. The research firm reiterated an overweight rating on the tech giant.   ""We expect another solid quarter when Microsoft releases earnings results this Thursday, which should reinforce our bullish stance on the company's progress in pivoting from laggard to leader in cloud, digital and artificial intelligence,"" equity analyst Brent Bracelin wrote in a note to clients.    He believes Microsoft's cloud business could become a game changer for the company in the years ahead, with the potential for organic revenue growth and margins to continue to improve.  "

Microsoft had more than 114,000 employees as of June 30, 2016, the end of its last fiscal year, and has more than 1,000 open positions that it's seeking to fill.The company is in the midst of a years-long transition to a cloud model, where it sells software as subscription services, rather than licensing it for installation on computers owned by its customers. During this transition, which accelerated when Satya Nadella took over as CEO in early 2014, Microsoft has laid off more than 25,000 workers, mostly from the smartphone business it gained in its 2013 acquisition of Nokia.The company will announce earnings for the December quarter on Thursday, January 26.

568,2008-05-05T12:26:54-0400,"Barely two hours into trading and Yahoo shares were on the decline in a big way, off about $4.50 a share, or almost 20 percent; while Microsoft shares were on the increase. Both stocks are well off their lows and highs of the morning, however, as investors try to figure out what they'll both do next. If anything.They will do something. It's just that whatever it is likely won't be ""together,"" even though Piper Jaffray is putting a 30 percent chance that these two will come back to the bargaining table to resume talks. I'm not sure that's in the cards. Instead, it's probably time to broaden the cast of players and talk about what Microsoft can do. Seems clear that the company will have to do something, seeing as its online business saw a nice jump in revenue for its Online Services Business, but at the same time, the unit racked up another $220 million in red ink. That's ugly, but uglier still when you consider Microsoft has been fumbling about trying to figure out a way to make money online for the better part of a decade. Microsoft's acquisition of Yahoo was as much about Internet advertising as it was about software distribution. A half-billion users globally is the kind of audience worth everything Microsoft was offering, especially if it could reach that audience as potential Microsoft software and hardware customers. It gets even more important when you grasp the concept of so-called ""Cloud Computing,"" one of the key buzzwords in the business nowadays. Software hosted on Web sites instead of loaded onto your PC. Software downloaded from Web sites instead of purchased in a store. It's a concept put forth by salesforce.com with a high degree of success. It's a concept embraced and espoused by Google . It's something Time Warner has talked about. Something important to Oracle. Microsoft needs a strategy here. Yahoo was almost like picking the low fruit. But now Microsoft will be forced to get a little more creative. Could a Microsoft play for salesforce be in the cards? There had been a lot of discussion that salesforce would be a compelling deal for Google as the search giant seeks to do for corporate clients what it's already doing for consumers. Microsoft could use the algorithms and do much the same thing across enterprise and consumer customers. And what about News Corp.? Seems Microsoft cozied up to Rupert Murdoch during the Yahoo negotiations; speculation is that News Corp. isn't interested in Yahoo, or can't come up with enough cash on its own to offer a competing bid to what Microsoft already put forth. So maybe News Corp. and Microsoft re-think their partnership and work together not just to take on Google, but Yahoo as well. MySpace doesn't seem to be the property it once was, when you see what other social networking sites like Facebook have become. But Yahoo today certainly isn't the property it once was either. And Microsoft already owns a small chunk of Facebook. Maybe it partners with News Corp. in some new, creative alliance that could be far cheaper than buying Yahoo, but could be far more effective at taking on Google? More voices to the debate today: JChang is ready to give Yahoo two years to get its shares up to the $37 that Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang thinks his company is worth. And if it doesn't happen, ""then he should buy all the stock holders out at $37."" My question: Why give Yahoo two years when you had a deal just a little below that right now, on the table, from Microsoft? Why wait? Trientimp takes issue with Mary Ellen's quote in the last post: ""She had a 50 percent premium when the stock ran up -- failed to sell it and now says 'Microsoft and Yahoo both screwed the Yahoo shareholders.' Greed -- it's the American weakness...unbelievable logic."" Pat wants to know, ""How is it possible that the future of a giant public co. be decided by only two company officers?"" And, ""It's not fair that it only took two idiots to have the final say whether to accept the offer or not. Don't the millions of share holders have voting rights?"" Well, actually, it was the entire board, but still! Sinardy Xing suggests that ""Yahoo should outsource the entire management team to Google, not only the Search department. Will Jerry (Yang) end up like Craig Conway from PeopleSoft?"" Also, to Yahoo's credit, the comments posted to Jerry Yang's blog this morning included some stinging criticism of Yang and the company's board. And Yahoo is posting all of them. Some do support the company, but by and large, the rebukes are biting. And certainly worth a read. Questions?  Comments?  TechCheck@cnbc.com"

""We have pilots going on with many many customers.""   Like tech giants Google, Amazon and Facebook, Microsoft is letting outside developers use the machine learning tools built in house to make their apps smarter and more responsive. The company introduced its virtual assistant called Cortana in 2014, and in December rolled it out to third-party apps and devices. Nadella said Microsoft's goal is to commoditize speech recognition, computer vision and text understanding, so that those tools are considered as a standard part of building a business.

Many businesses have started the process of buying new PCs because Microsoft Corp has said it will end support for Windows 7 in early 2020.""There's been really strong demand for both the consumer and enterprise for PCs which helped.

Davidson &amp; Co analyst Thomas Forte said.""Google, Microsoft, and Walmart ... are more difficult to kill,"" he said.Shares in Alphabet dropped about 2 percent after it fell short on sales after beating estimates for the past eight quarters.Revenue from Amazon's international business, which brings in 27.5 percent of total sales, was at the heart of the shortfall in results, growth halving to 13.4 percent compared to the previous quarter.""We don't see any real structural issue with Amazon but nearly every line in the business is decelerating a tad and we typically see another deceleration in retail in 4Q, hence are struggling to identify a catalyst,"" Barclays analyst Ross Sandler said.Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin saw two possible reasons Amazon forecast a holiday shopping quarter weaker than anticipated by Wall Street.""They are worried about the macro. The second thing is they're worried about competition,"" he said, noting that there were both signs of a slowing economy and that major retailers were aggressively deploying strategies to compete with Amazon for holiday sales.Amazon expected sales in the holiday quarter leading up to Christmas to rise between 10 percent and 20 percent, to as much as $72.5 billion, while analysts on average had expected $73.9 billion, according to Refinitiv data.Its operating profit forecast of between $2.1 billion and $3.6 billion also came in below consensus estimates.Several analysts called the company's outlook conservative and said any outright dip in profit seems highly unlikely.""Overall, Amazon's growth trajectory remains solid, including advertising, grocery, pharmacy, and specialty retail, as well as Amazon Business ($10 billion in sales in eight countries) and Amazon Web Services,"" Telsey Advisory Group analysts said.Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft all continued growth in cloud services but with signs of deceleration.In the latest quarterly reports, Microsofts cloud computing business Azure marked revenue growth of 76 percent, down from 89 percent in the previous quarter.

The announcement suggests the world's biggest software company is nearing the end of its search for a new leader, which began in August when Steve Ballmer announced his plan to retire within 12 months.   Microsoft pledged to pick a successor within that time frame, although most investors had expected the process to be finished by December or January.

I don't think it's surprising that it is taking some time to try to find the right person,'' said Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore Partners.   Microsoft shares were down 1.1 percent at $36.47 on Nasdaq.   ""We're moving ahead well, and I expect we'll complete our work in the early part of 2014,'' Microsoft lead independent director John Thompson said in a blog post on the company's website.

Sources familiar with the search process have told Reuters that the committee is down to a ""handful"" of candidates, including Ford Motor CEO Alan Mulally and one or two internal candidates.  (Read more: Redbox president leaves; 3 ventures shuttered)   ""We identified over 100 possible candidates, talked with several dozen and then focused our energy intensely on a group of about 20 individuals,"" said Thompson in the blog. ""As this group has narrowed, we've done deeper research and investigation, including with the full board.""   Intense speculation has surrounded Ford's Mulally as a leading candidate. He has not denied interest in the job, but has repeatedly said he enjoys working at Ford, where he is slated to remain through 2014.   Last week it was reported that Qualcomm executive Steve Mollenkopf was a leading candidate for the job, but the chip maker forestalled that by making him CEO.  (Read more: Here's what the 2014 tech IPO pipeline looks like)   In choosing between Mulally, a candidate from the technology industry, and its own ranks of executives, Microsoft must make a decision on how much it desires large-scale management experience or deep technical knowledge in its CEO.

575,2018-08-27T12:30:00-0400,"SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 27 (Reuters) - VMware Inc will acquire CloudHealth Technologies as part of the information technology company's continued push into cloud-based software services, the company announced on Monday.The Palo Alto, California, company will pay approximately $500 million for the Boston-based startup, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.VMware will purchase CloudHealth for the company's cloud management platform, VMware Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters. That platform makes it possible for enterprises to control and analyze the costs, compliance and performance of their computing environments across their own data centers and public clouds like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp's Azure.Anybody who is deploying apps operating in a cloud is utilizing multiple public clouds. How do I manage that complexity? CloudHealth is exactly aligned with that, Gelsinger said. He declined to comment on the price of the deal.The company announced its acquisition in Las Vegas at VMworld, the company's annual industry conference, where it also announced a series of new cloud services, including an expansion of the VMware Cloud on AWS partnership with Amazon.com Inc .VMware has been adding subscription-based software services over the past year as more corporations begin to shift their computing and data storage systems off of their own servers and into public clouds.Key to this strategy has been the VMware Cloud on AWS partnership that makes it simple for enterprises to transition onto the cloud. With the addition of CloudHealth, VMware is making it easier for its customers to manage services on other cloud providers, such as Azure and Alphabet Incs Google Cloud Platform.Were going to refresh the vision that we have for the cloud, Gelsinger said.Among infrastructure decision makers at enterprises, 91 percent said they use two or more vendor's public cloud environments, with 19 percent of respondents saying they use between six and nine, according to an April report by Forrester Research.Within the global cloud systems management software, VMware holds 21 percent of the market, followed by Microsoft Corp with 14 percent, according to 2016 figures provided by research firm IDC. That market is projected to be worth $5.4 billion this year and is forecast to reach $10.1 billion in 2021, according to IDC.Multi-cloud is a growing use case, and its something that enterprise IT shops are very interested in, said Paul Delory, Gartner analyst. It behooves everyone in this space to work with multiple cloud providers.VMware expects the acquisition to close this quarter, the company said. Its immediate plans for CloudHealth include the integration of two of VMwares existing cloud services, analytics tool Wavefront and security tool CloudCoreo. More services will become integrated over time, and CloudHealth, which has hundreds of employees, will continue to operate in Boston, Gelsinger said.Dell owns 81 percent of VMware and considered combining the two companies earlier this year. Dell ultimately proposed to pay $21.7 billion in cash and stock to buy back securities called tracking stock that correspond to its economic interest in VMware, partially funded through a $9 billion special dividend from VMware.Some shareholders in the stock that tracks Dell's stake in VMware may oppose the deal because they feel the proposal is too low and unfairly transfers value to Dell, sources have said, and a vote is expected in October.

576,2018-10-31T01:00:00-0400,"sources@ SEATTLE/ORLANDO, Fla., Oct 31 (Reuters) - SpaceX Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk flew to the Seattle area in June for meetings with engineers leading a satellite launch project crucial to his space company's growth. Within hours of landing, Musk had fired at least seven members of the program's senior management team at the Redmond, Washington, office, the culmination of disagreements over the pace at which the team was developing and testing its Starlink satellites, according to the two SpaceX employees with direct knowledge of the situation. Known for pushing aggressive deadlines, Musk quickly brought in new managers from SpaceX headquarters in California to replace a number of the managers he fired. Their mandate: Launch SpaceX's first batch of U.S.-made satellites by the middle of next year, the sources said. The management shakeup and the launch timeline, previously unreported, illustrate how quickly Musk wants to bring online SpaceX's Starlink program, which is competing with OneWeb and Canada's Telesat to be first to market with a new satellite-based Internet service. Those services - essentially a constellation of satellites that will bring high-speed Internet to rural and suburban locations globally - are key to generating the cash that privately-held SpaceX needs to fund Musk's real dream of developing a new rocket capable of flying paying customers to the moon and eventually trying to colonize Mars. ""It would be like rebuilding the Internet in space,"" Musk told an audience in 2015 when he unveiled Starlink. ""The goal would be to have a majority of long-distance Internet traffic go over this network."" But the program is struggling to hire and retain staff, the employees said. Currently, about 300 SpaceX employees work on Starlink in Redmond, the sources said. According to GeekWire, Musk said in 2015 the Redmond operation would have ""probably several hundred people, maybe a thousand people"" after 3-4 years in operation. So far this year, about 50 employees left the company ""on their own accord,"" one of the SpaceX employees said, though the reason for those departures was unclear. Overall, SpaceX employs more than 6,000 staff. As of Tuesday, there were 22 job openings - including a job making espresso drinks - for the Redmond office, according to SpaceX's website. SpaceX spokeswoman Eva Behrend told Reuters the Redmond office remains an essential part of the company's efforts to build a next-generation satellite network. ""Given the success of our recent Starlink demonstration satellites, we have incorporated lessons learned and re-organized to allow for the next design iteration to be flown in short order,"" Behrend said. She had no further comment on the reorganization or the launch window, but noted the strategy was similar to the rapid iteration in design and testing which led to the success of its rockets. Among the managers fired from the Redmond office was SpaceX Vice President of Satellites Rajeev Badyal, an engineering andhardware veteran of Microsoft Corp and Hewlett-Packard, and top designer Mark Krebs, who worked in Google's satellite and aircraft division, the employees said. Krebs declined to comment, and Badyal did not respond to requests for comment. The management shakeup followed in-fighting over pressure from Musk to speed up satellite testing schedules, one of the sources said. SpaceX's Behrend offered no comment on the matter. Culture was also a challenge for recent hires, a second source said. A number of the managers had been hired from nearby technology giant Microsoft, where workers were more accustomed to longer development schedules than Musk's famously short deadlines. Another senior manager that left SpaceX was Kim Schulze, who was previously a development manager at Microsoft, one of the people said. Schulze did not respond to a request for comment. ""Rajeev wanted three more iterations of test satellites,"" one of the sources said. ""Elon thinks we can do the job with cheaper and simpler satellites, sooner."" A billionaire and Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Inc , Musk is known for ambitious projects ranging from auto electrification and rocket-building to high-speed transit tunnels. A Musk trust owns 54 percent of the outstanding stock of SpaceX, according to a 2016 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, SpaceX's most recent.JUNE 2019 LAUNCH GOAL SpaceX has said it would launch its satellites in phases through 2024. It goal of having Internet service available in 2020 is ""pretty much on target"" with an initial satellite launch OneWeb aims for a first launch between December and February 2019, while Telesat was targeting 2022 for broadband services.SpaceX employees told Reuters that two Starlink test satellites launched in February, dubbed Tintin A and B, were functioning as intended. The company is refining the orbital path of the satellites after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which oversees satellites in orbit, approved a request from SpaceX to expand Tintins' altitude range, one of the sources said. The FCC confirmed SpaceX's modifications, which have not been reported previously, but declined further comment. ""We're using the Tintins to explore that modification,"" one of the SpaceX employee sources said. ""They're happy and healthy and we're talking with them every time they pass a ground station, dozens of times a day."" SpaceX engineers have used the two test satellites to play online video games at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California and the Redmond office, the source said. ""We were streaming 4k YouTube and playing 'Counter-Strike: Global Offensive' from Hawthorne to Redmond in the first week,"" the person added.MORE SATELLITES In March, the FCC approved Musk's plan to beam down Internet signals from 4,425 small satellites launched into standard low-Earth orbit - more than two times the total number of active satellites there presently. One SpaceX engineer told Reuters the company has studied plans to add roughly 10,000 additional satellites after its first array is live to meet bandwidth demand in the coming 20 years. Behrend declined to comment on the plans and referred to a previous FCC filing, which states an additional 7,518 satellites are under consideration. Such a move would keep it in the race to expand affordable high-speed Internet access to billions of people in rural or suburban areas globally. The Satellite Industry Association, a lobby group, estimates the global market for satellite-based broadband and television services is worth $127.7 billion, dwarfing the roughly $5.5 billion satellite launch services market. McLean, Virginia-based OneWeb is working to provide internet service from roughly 900 satellites after raising more than $2billion from SoftBank, the Coca-Cola Company and others. Telesat, backed by Loral Space &amp; Communications Inc , said on Oct. 23 it conducted the first-ever live test of in-flight broadband via a satellite in low-Earth orbit, and was targeting 2022 for broadband services from a constellation of some 300 satellites. SpaceX aims to provide Internet service by linking its satellites to ground stations and mountable terminals about the size of a pizza box at homes or businesses, according to the FCC filing. The U.S. market for broadband is already dominated by several incumbent communications companies, including ComcastCorporation . Comcast declined to comment on the potential new competition. While SpaceX's model of reusing rockets has generated cash, it is not enough to cover the roughly $5 billion cost to develop its Big Falcon Rocket that Musk wants one day to fly to Mars.""There had to be a much bigger idea for generating cash to basically realize the Mars plans,"" said one of the SpaceX employees. ""What better idea than to put Comcast out of business?""(Reporting by Eric M. Johnson in Seattle and Joey Roulette in Orlando, Florida; editing by Greg Mitchell and Edward Tobin)"

Montreal, Canada-based start-up Element AI is the first investment in a new AI fund launched by Microsoft Ventures and far from a jobs killer, the start-up views the rise of AI as a human worker's best chance at remaining relevant.    ""There's a lot of talk about bringing back jobs,"" Element AI CEO Jean-François Gagné told CNBC on Monday. ""As you do that, you need to stay competitive. You need to augment the workers, provide them with better tools. These are all areas where AI can do a lot."" To start, Element AI plans to build upon local resources available in Montreal and foster the creation of hundreds of jobs over the next five years, helping to preserve local talent and boost the Canadian economy.   Element AI, which was just formed in October, works with large corporations and research institutes to help businesses identify opportunities to invest in AI.    Companies in Microsoft's AI venture fund will ""help people and machines work together to increase access to education, teach new skills and create jobs, enhance the capabilities of existing workforces and improve the treatment of diseases, to name just a few examples,"" Nagraj Kashyap, corporate vice president of Microsoft Ventures, wrote in a blog post Monday.   ""We'll make investments in startups that are responsibly harnessing the promise of AI to empower people and businesses,"" Kashyap wrote.

578,2017-01-28T21:41:06-0500," President Donald Trump's decision to temporarily bar refugees from certain countries drew an emotional response from Google CEO Sundar Pichai, who said the move impacted nearly 200 of the company's employees and urged them to return to the U.S. in a company-wide email.   In a letter to employees seen by CNBC, Pichai said he was ""upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families."" The existence of the memo was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.   ""We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US,"" a Google spokesperson told CNBC.     ""We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere,"" the Google rep added.   Separately, Microsoft also voiced concerns about the policy, which was announced late Friday and immediately ricocheted across the world. Both Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Google's Pichai are Indian-Americans.   The software giant told CNBC in a statement that ""we share the concerns about the impact of the executive order on our employees from the listed countries, all of whom have been in the United States lawfully, and we're actively working with them to provide legal advice and assistance.""   Moreover, Pichai said that at least 187 of Google's employees were from the countries included in the sweeping seven country ban, such as Syria, Iraq, Iran and Libya.    ""Our first order of business is to help Googlers who are affected,"" Pichai said. ""If you're abroad and need help, please reach out to our global security team."" Pichai added that it was ""painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues.""   The move sparked an outpouring of anger and condemnation worldwide.

579,2019-01-09T17:04:36-0500,"Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced Wednesday that he and his wife, MacKenzie, plan to file for divorce.It is unclear what the terms of the agreement will be, but lawyers say it is likely Jeff Bezos will figure out a way to retain voting power at Amazon.If the couple chooses to file in Washington state, where they have a home and Amazon is headquartered, assets they accumulated during their 25-year marriage would be considered to be owned by both of them, according to state law, unless they have a prenuptial agreement.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, announced Wednesday their plan to divorce. What this will mean for his businesses?Jeff Bezos is best known for founding Amazon, and he's still the company's largest shareholder by far, owning 16.3 percent of its shares according to the company's 2018 proxy statement. He also founded space company Blue Origin and bought The Washington Post during the course of his 25-year marriage to MacKenzie.Washington state, where Amazon is headquartered and the Bezoses have a home, is a ""community property"" state under state law. That means, if the couple files for divorce there, all assets and debts accrued during their marriage will be considered owned by both husband and wife. The law dictates that these assets be equitably divided unless a prenuptial agreement states otherwise. It's not known whether the couple has any such agreement in place.Seattle-based divorce attorney David Starks said that an equitable split does not always mean the assets will be split 50/50.In typical cases, Starks said, a court would attempt to even out assets so that both parties end up on roughly equal footing in the long-term. If one spouse has more earning potential, for example, that person may receive fewer assets since they are more likely to be able to provide for themselves over the long term.But in the Bezoses' case, where Jeff has a net worth of $137 billion, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, the court will probably divide the money evenly.""When you're going to leave as a billionaire, it seems unlikely that a court would spend time trying to figure out who is more wealthy ten years from now,"" Starks said.The more pressing concern for shareholders is how the divorce could affect Jeff Bezos' control of the company.The experts who CNBC interviewed could not think of another situation where a founder of such an influential company divorced a spouse who had been with them since the company's founding. The only one who came to mind was Rupert Murdoch, whose second wife Anna was with him for more than 30 years as he built his media empire before divorcing in 1999, but they reportedly had a prenuptial agreement.It may be difficult for the Bezoses to split up their wealth without dipping significantly into their Amazon shares, said Jordan Neyland, an assistant professor of law at George Mason University who has written on the topic of CEO divorces.""A lot of the prior CEO divorces have been more career professionals that have built up other wealth before becoming CEO,"" Neyland said. ""So I think that's what makes this one a little different, being a founder getting divorced while in office.""Typically, CEOs could avoid splitting up their shares by leaving other assets to their spouses, such as real estate and other property. But for the Bezoses, Neyland said, ""all the wealth is going to be tied up in Amazon. In this case, I don't know, of course, what to think of something of this magnitude, but I imagine his spouse is going to get some amount of stock in Amazon. So this is going to change the ownership in Amazon.""This could mean Amazon may need to find a new structure to ensure that Jeff Bezos still owns enough voting power with his shares, Neyland said, like creating different classes of shares with varied amounts of voting power.""This would be some creative lawyering that would have to happen,"" Neyland said. ""I don't know if there's been any sort of precedent for this.""But Starks speculated that the couple probably came to an agreement on that point well before making their public announcement Wednesday.""I have to imagine that some of the longest conversations and most legal mind power went into how to fashion a settlement that retained Jeff Bezos' ability to remain a controlling shareholder in Amazon,"" Starks said. In order for this to happen, Starks said, MacKenzie Bezos could have elected to give up claim to the stock or give up her voting rights to her shares.Some of the terms of the settlement may come to light in Amazon SEC filings. Amazon declined to commentShareholders may also worry about the Amazon CEO's state of mind as he goes through a difficult personal situation. But one expert pointed out the Bezoses' exceptional wealth as a mitigating factor.David Larcker, a professor at Stanford's Graduate School of Business with a focus on corporate governance, wrote a 2013 research paper outlining the ways in which a CEO divorce could impact shareholders. Some CEOs who divest personal assets to fund a divorce develop risk-aversion in the business. People who see their net worth go down significantly may be less willing to bet on risky innovation.But in the case of Jeff Bezos, Larcker doubts risk-aversion will be at play because the numbers are so large.""If you've got someone, say, worth ten million dollars, and they give half to their spouse either male or female, so their wealth goes down to five million, in that kind of setting, if you believe you become more risk averse if you have less money, that may translate to more risk averse decision-making."" He added, ""I think in this case I probably wouldn't go down that path. I'm sure the numbers are inconceivable to you and I.""American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers President Peter Walzer suggested that ""the only thing shareholders should be concerned about is lengthy litigation.""But he doesn't see that happening: ""From...the way that the announcement was made and the tone I don't think they're going to do that.""Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."

584,2019-01-04T16:48:46-0500,"Apple has long faced the risk that doing business in China will compromise its intellectual property and trade secrets.While Apple didn't mention IP issues in lowering its guidance this week, it's an ongoing concern. White House advisor Larry Kudlow hinted at the problem on Friday.Larry Kudlow, President Trump's economic adviser, suggested on Friday that China was stealing intellectual property and trade secrets from Apple, which may be contributing to the iPhone maker's financial challenges in the country.However, he hedged a bit: ""I don't want to surmise too much here, but Apple technology may have been picked off by China and now China is becoming very competitive with Apple,"" Kudlow said.That was diplomatic of him. Because China is clearly taking Apple's IP and trade secrets and that fact is most certainly damaging the company's business.This isn't a new problem, and companies know that, to some degree, it's the price of doing business in the world's second-biggest economy. Apple is at particular risk because of its large exposure to China and because of the country's increasingly sophisticated manufacturing sector. Last year, China's Huawei surpassed Apple in shipments of smartphones.U.S. intelligence agencies and the Justice Department have laid out a long list of the types of concerted hacking and spying campaigns used by China to steal the IP of U.S. tech companies. China and its companies have strongly denied most of these claims over the years, making it hard for U.S. companies to take action. For example, a former Apple engineer was arrested in 2018 and charged with stealing self-driving car secrets. The engineer has denied the claims and pleaded not guilty in a California court.Kudlow added just a bit of insight to his assessment on Friday, saying that ""there are some indications from China that they're looking at that, but we don't know that yet. There's no enforcement. there's nothing concrete.""Apple didn't provide a comment for this story.But it's not just the alleged, illegal ""theft"" of IP that companies are worried about. China has plenty of tools to legally gain access to intellectual property.In 2016, the government enacted a new cybersecurity law that provided a clearer view into the IP-for-access transactional nature of doing business on the mainland. In the first version of that law, companies were required to provide the government with source code or other valuable encryption information supposedly to ensure that the code is secure, according to the statute. Source code is the computer code that makes up the backbone of a company's operating system, its applications or other programs.While there have been some changes to the 2016 law, experts routinely warn companies that Chinese regulators have a significant degree of control over what type of private information they can demand, even beyond source code or encryption.Apple, Microsoft and Google all expressed significant concerns with the law at the time, but they have little recourse. China began implementing it in 2017, and companies have for the most part shown they're willingness to comply.One aspect of the law requires companies with data in the cloud to partner with Chinese-owned service providers to store that information. That's raised concern that cloud services provide another way for China to ensure easy access to both the data of its citizens and the IP of foreign companies. Nevertheless, in July 2017, Apple said it was transferring its data in China to a company called Guizhou-Cloud Big Data.U.S. lawmakers have good reason to be more vocal about tech companies' plans for China than they are when it comes to consumer goods brands like Nike.For one, they don't want American tech companies to have the appearance of supporting a government that uses technology to oppress its citizens. You may have noticed how government officials have criticized Google over the Dragonfly internet search engine project the company has explored with the Chinese government.China employs 200 million surveillance cameras and facial recognition software to track its population, has a strict social credit system and has jailed unknown numbers of dissidents for expressing their opinions online.But perhaps the bigger concern is that if China is allowed to access the source code and encryption information from U.S. companies, the Chinese government could use that data to tap into U.S. government agencies, banks and other facilities that also use that same technology.The Trump administration has been vague on details, but it may well realize that this trade-off is bad for the American economy even if Apple and other companies have to sacrifice some of their growth.WATCH: CNBC's December interview with Larry Kudlow"
585,2013-09-09T08:09:03-0400," Microsoft is making its Xbox Music streaming service available for free on the Web—even to those who don't use Windows 8.   The expansion beyond Windows 8 devices and Xbox game consoles starting Monday is intended to bring new customers into the software giant's ecosystem of devices and services and could help it compete with other digital music offerings like Pandora, Spotify and iTunes. It's also an acknowledgement that the music service hasn't done much to drive sales of the Windows 8 operating system.   The move represents another step toward Microsoft's goal of becoming a company that sells devices and services, rather than primarily software, said Michael Turits, an analyst with financial advisory firm Raymond James. It comes on the heels of Microsoft announcing it would buy the mobile phone handset manufacturing business of Nokia Corp. for $7.2 billion and that CEO Steve Ballmer would step down within 12 months.   (Read more: XboxOne pre-order supply nearly sold out)  ""They've said they're going to be a devices and services company. We know they want to be a device company since they're buying the Nokia phone division,"" he said. ""This kind of thing gives more credibility to the idea they'll be more of a services company as well.""   Most buyers of the new Windows 8 operating system discovered Xbox Music because it's the default player for music files that people have imported from elsewhere, according to Xbox Music general manager Jerry Johnson. Opening it up to the broader public would give more people a chance to see the benefits of having multiple devices linked to Microsoft's platform. Its music service, for example, will save favorites and playlists across PCs, Windows Phones and Xbox game consoles.   ""To actually build that ecosystem, we need to bring people into it,"" Johnson said.   Xbox Music allows people to choose from 30 million tracks and stream them for free with ads. The service sells downloadable tracks that have been kept off streaming services by artists or labels. A radio service on Xbox Music also generates song playlists automatically along genres or similar artists.   The thinking is if new consumers enjoy the free experience online, some might upgrade to pay $10 a month for the Xbox Music Pass, which allows playback on mobile phones and Microsoft's game console, Xbox 360, and its upcoming version, Xbox One. Microsoft is also launching apps for iPhones and Android devices that will allow paying subscribers to access Xbox Music. Previously, you had to have a device running the Windows Phone 8 operating system to access the plan on the go.   (Read more: Xbox One-80: Behind Microsoft's multiple about-faces)  The decision to allow Xbox Music to run on competitors' phone platforms is in line with Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft's move in June to release app versions of its Office software on Apple's iPhone.   Microsoft is also updating its Xbox Music interface by reducing the size of cover art but adding tabs to make it easier to create and manage playlists.   Starting with its release Nov. 22, Xbox One users will also be able to play games while listening to Xbox Music simultaneously, a feature that isn't offered on the Xbox 360. —By The Associated Press."
586,2016-11-21T05:16:04-0500,"  Alibaba is planning to launch four new data centers across the world, the Chinese e-commerce giant said on Monday, as it steps up its competition against Amazon and Microsoft in the rapidly-growing cloud computing market.    The data centers will be located in Dubai, Tokyo in Japan, Germany and Sydney, Australia. It takes the number of Alibaba Cloud data centers outside of China to eight, with the Chinese technology giant now on nearly every major continent.    ""With the addition of those four data centers, it will cover our customers globally,"" Ethan Yu, general manager of Alibaba Cloud Global, told CNBC in a phone interview.    In each market, Alibaba Cloud has formed joint ventures (JV) and partnerships. In Dubai, Alibaba has formed a JV with Meraas Holdings called YVOLV. In Germany, Alibaba has partnered with Vodafone to open its first data center in Europe. Alibaba will use Vodafone's data center in order to sell its cloud services. In Japan, a JV with Softbank called SB Cloud Corporation was formed earlier this year.    The Sydney data center will come online ""within a few weeks,"" Yu told CNBC. The executive said Alibaba was not disclosing the financial terms of the deals but there are revenue sharing agreements in place. The JV with SoftBank will be 60 percent owned by SoftBank with 40 percent owned by Alibaba, the companies said earlier this year.   Alibaba's global expansion is a bid to challenge the likes of Amazon, Microsoft, IBM and Google, who combined control over half of the worldwide cloud market, according to data from Synergy Research Group. Alibaba is much smaller than Amazon Web Services (AWS) which leads the market, but is growing very quickly.   In its latest fiscal quarter ended September 30, Alibaba reported revenue from its cloud computing division that increased 130 percent year-on-year to $224 million. This outpaced the growth seen by Microsoft, Google, and Amazon's cloud units.    Alibaba's cloud unit has 2.3 million customers of which 651,000 are paying customers. Yu said the company's next milestone is 1 million paying users but offered no timeframe on when this would be achieved. The cloud business is also still unprofitable with the focus still on scaling.   ""We are not looking at profitability as the near term goal. For now, our goal is to keep expanding our market leadership and therefore we will continue to make investments and develop that for rapid expansion,"" Yu told CNBC.    Alibaba Cloud – also known as Aliyun – has been helped by supportive government regulation in China, which has the development of cloud computing a priority. Domestic players like Alibaba have benefitted while foreign vendors have found it difficult to enter the market.    This is a differentiator for Alibaba Cloud and is attractive for international businesses trying to crack the Chinese market.   ""We have a strong flavor of China and Asia. We are the true cloud that can provide a global infrastructure to our end users and are connected globally especially in China,"" Yu told CNBC.    Alibaba currently has two data center locations in the U.S. and Yu said the company has seen a ""big number"" of customers using cloud services to expand their U.S. footprint.    But technology companies are trying to figure out what a Donald Trump presidency means for their business. The president-elect has touted the idea of a 45 percent import tariff on Chinese goods, though it's unclear if this plan will go through.    Yu said it's too early to tell what effect Trump's policies will have.   ""We will be in a much better position in a few months down the road. For me, a very positive relationship between China and the U.S. will be helpful for all business moving forward. From our perspective, we will focus on our business first,"" Yu said. "

590,2016-11-14T23:47:32-0500,"  While Microsoft and Salesforce have been partners — and at times considered being even more than that — Marc Benioff says the relationship has soured, in part because the new Microsoft is too much like the old one.   In particular, Benioff pointed to a meeting that was set up between him and Scott Guthrie, who was then running Microsoft Azure, the company's cloud-based operating system.  More from Recode:Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff: 'Without Twitter, you wouldn't have President-elect Trump' Why wait for a new smart car when you can update your existing one?   Should you ignore the Trump dump of tech stocks? Yes.   A few weeks after the meeting, Benioff learned that Guthrie was taking over as head of the CRM business that competes directly with Salesforce. ""I was just very kind of surprised by this,"" Benioff said Monday, speaking at Code Enterprise in San Francisco. ""It's not something I would do. Things like that kept happening.""   Things escalated when Salesforce found itself invited and then uninvited to a Microsoft partner conference, Benioff said.   Salesforce and Microsoft have always had something of a complicated relationship, being partners, competitors and even potential participants in a merger.   More recently, though, the rivalry has turned bitter. In addition to the issue with Guthrie, Microsoft and Salesforce were also in a bidding war over LinkedIn. Benioff actually offered more for LinkedIn, and said he was even willing to go higher.   Benioff has warned that Microsoft could be violating antitrust laws by combining its powerful position in office software with LinkedIn's data, asking officials in Europe to look into the matter.   —By Ina Fried, Re/code.net.

591,2016-11-15T14:12:05-0500,"  Email killer Slack is under attack from email giant Microsoft, but Slack executives say they welcome competition, with a little trepidation.    ""It's flattering in some ways,"" said April Underwood, vice president of product at Slack. ""It's also, honestly, it's a little scary."" Underwood's comments came at the Code Enterprise conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. Microsoft launched a rival workplace messaging service earlier this month.  Microsoft's investment in this space has brought more attention to the overall category and validates Slack's thesis that people need better ways to communicate at work, said Underwood. But the Seattle-based giant of email has many more users and far greater resources than venture-backed start-up Slack. ""They're a little bit larger than us as a company, they have some resources available to them and some distribution advantages available to them that we don't have,"" she said.   CEO Stewart Butterfield took out this ad in the New York Times ahead of Microsoft's launch of Teams, its rival product.  That feeling when you think ""we should buy a full page in the Times and publish an open letter,"" and then you do.""We're not surprised that that product came out, we had a sense that it was coming,"" said Underwood.   Indeed, completion is heating up. Facebook, with its last month rolled out a business chat product called Workplace by Facebook, which incorporates some similar messaging features.  Slack now has 4 million daily active users, 750 developer apps integrated into its service which are used by 90 percent of companies which use Slack's paid service.   Apps and artificially intelligent bots on Slack are two key things the company hopes will differentiate its service from competitors. Slack has recently announced with partnerships with IBM Watson to make its bots on Slack smarter, Salesforce, and Alphabet's Google, whose venture arm has invested in Slack.  "
592,2016-11-15T23:38:53-0500," Microsoft beat Salesforce to acquire LinkedIn because it offered all cash and less risk, said LinkedIn  CEO Jeff Weiner.   Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff was a class act throughout the negotiations, but at the end of the day it came down to dollars and cents, said Weiner.   ""Microsoft's offer was of greater value — an all cash offer versus stock and cash —where Salesforce would have potentially been diluted in a way where the stock that they offered to lose value, at least in the near term,"" said Weiner. Weiner's comments came at the Code Enterprise conference in San Francisco Tuesday night.  Microsoft will integrate LinkedIn's social network into its suite of products such as Office, Windows, Outlook and Azure to reach over a billion customers, said Weiner.   With Linkedin, Microsoft will have a better understanding of who its users are and can create more value out of existing products, he said.   Benioff has called on European regulators to investigate the deal on anti-trust concerns.   Even after the Microsoft takeover is complete, which is expected to happen by the end of the year, LinkedIn will continue to partner with companies such as SAP, IBM and Salesforce and determine how its data are used, said Weiner.    Salesforce has significant market share when it comes to customer relationship management software and ultimately, more competition is good for customers, said Weiner. "

""One that helps build a team culture that is both fun and inclusive, so everyone has a voice."" The application, which lets users talk to their co-workers, supports tabs for other Microsoft cloud services, like access to files and Skype video-conferencing. Teams also offers multifactor authentication and encryption. It works on desktop, Windows phone, iOS and Android, and is available Wednesday as a customer preview, or widely in the first quarter of 2017.The interface, like Facebook, uses threaded posts with comments on them, and can integrate emojis, chat bots, Tweets, polls, and mark messages by importance.Microsoft has deepened its push into social media over the past five years, purchasing Yammer for $1.2 billion in 2012, andLinkedIn for $26.2 billion earlier this year.As consumers use messaging platforms for more tasks, such as hailing cars and making payments, messaging has also played an increasingly larger role in the workplace.

596,2016-11-02T12:07:50-0400," Microsoft is just minutes away from unveiling its Slack competitor, Microsoft Teams, at an event in New York City today. The software giant is expected to position its Teams software with tight integration into Microsoft Office, Skype, and the company's Office 365 services, and as a direct competitor to Slack. Microsoft hasn't even officially unveiled its Teams service, but that's not stopping Slack from getting some words out before the software maker's event.   In a full back page ad in the New York Times, Slack welcomes Microsoft's competition into the messaging market with some ""friendly advice."" In a long note, that's also published on Slack's blog, the company warns Microsoft that it's not the features that matter, it's the craftsmanship and human aspects of the software. ""We've spent tens of thousands of hours talking to customers and adapting Slack to find the grooves that match all those human quirks,"" says the Slack team. ""The internal transparency and sense of shared purpose that Slack-using teams discover is not an accident. Tiny details make big differences."" @stewart: That feeling when you think ""we should buy a full page in the Times and publish an open letter,"" and then you do.  Despite being a closed-source software-as-a-service tool, Slack claims that ""an open platform is essential"" in its warning letter to Microsoft. ""The modern knowledge worker relies on dozens of different products for their daily work, and that number is constantly expanding,"" explains the Slack team. ""These critical business processes and workflows demand the best tools, regardless of vendor.""  More from The Verge: MacBook Pro review: the Air apparent The first Google Tango phone delivers true augmented reality gaming The SPUD is an absurd 24-inch portable display that opens like an umbrella   Slack has done a wonderful job at integrating many services into its product, but this doesn't make it an open platform that people can contribute to freely. There are 750 apps in the Slack App Directory, but any of those could disappear at any point because Slack controls the keys. Nobody is expecting Microsoft to do anything different, as that's the key selling point of providing this software as a service to millions of customers, so it's odd to see Slack position itself as ""open"" in the sense of software.   The final point in Slack's note is an important one, it's all about love. ""You'll need to take a radically different approach to supporting and partnering with customers to help them adjust to new and better ways of working,"" warns the Slack team. ""If you want customers to switch to your product, you're going to have to match our commitment to their success and take the same amount of delight in their happiness."" That's something Microsoft, as a corporate giant, will have to adjust to, and Slack will always have the edge and focus there.   Slack ends its ad with a defiant message that it's here to stay, no matter what Microsoft announces today, and welcomes the software maker ""to the revolution."" The entire note sounds like Slack is worried about Microsoft's entry into this market, and the company even admits ""it's a little scary."" As Ben Thompson points out on Twitter, it's also eerily similar to Apple's welcome to IBM and its personal computers in the Wall Street Journal in 1981, or Rdio's response to Apple Music. We all know how both of those worked out.   Slack has many reasons to fear Microsoft today. While the chat service has seen impressive growth with 4 million daily active users, it's yet to break into all of the big companies that are dominated by Microsoft's productivity tools. Slack has managed to hit 28 out of Fortune 100 companies, and some key customers include IBM, eBay, EA, Pinterest, TIME, and LinkedIn. It all depends on how Microsoft positions Microsoft Teams, but if it's part of what a business is already paying for with Microsoft Office, then it might make many technology officers think twice about paying for Slack on top. We'll find out a lot more about Microsoft Teams at 11AM ET today, and The Verge will be covering Microsoft's news as it happens. "
597,2016-11-03T12:13:54-0400,"  Slack has always been easy to like. The fast-growing team communication startup had a classic underdog story, with its founders falling ass-backwards into enterprise software following a failed effort to build a video game. It's led by Stewart Butterfield, one of the kindest and most self-aware founders in Silicon Valley, who had previously given the world Flickr and then gone through the wringer after its acquisition by Yahoo. And it makes a genuinely useful product — the company may not have killed email yet, but it does seem to be reducing the volume.   Today 4 million people use Slack every day, the company is on pace to generate $100 million in revenue this year, and investors have valued it at $3.8 billion. But as of this week, it also has a major competitor: Microsoft, which unveiled its Teams product Wednesday at an event in New York City. It's like Slack, but with a few key twists: threaded conversations, deep integrations with Office, and (if you're already an Office 365 subscriber) available at no extra charge.   Slack could have done what most companies do when a competitor rips them off, and said nothing. (This was Snapchat's approach recently when Facebook began looting it for parts.) Instead, in the dubious tradition of Apple and uh, Rdio, the company published a remarkably smarmy full-page ad in the New York Times. The ad was a mistake on Slack's part — one that immediately put a yet-to-launch product on equal footing with its own, while still managing to cast a $461 billion company as the scrappy upstart. For a company that brags about how thoughtful it is about language, this week's letter is a regrettable unforced error. (The company declined to talk to me about the letter.)  @stewart Tweet  Slack's letter adopts the tortured conceit that it will give Microsoft advice about how to build a team-communication app. This puts the company in the odd position of having to pretend it is not just rooting for a competitor but offering material support. ""We're genuinely excited to have some competition,"" it begins — ""genuinely"" not being a word we usually feel the need to add when we're being genuine. But soon the letter's actual point, which is to anxiously brag about Slack, peeks through the clouds. ""All this is harder than it looks,"" Slack warns. And then the company straps on its wax wings and flies into the sun. OF COURSE IT'S ABOUT THE FEATURES""First, and most importantly, it's not the features that matter,"" the company says. This is transparently false. Before Slack added features, the underlying product was called internet relay chat, and it was about as mainstream as a Github repo. Slack's original insight was that if you pulled enough external services into a chat window, you could turn it into a kind of command console for your organization, and it would suddenly feel accessible to the average person. And so it created that — by adding features. You might even say that it added those features first. And most importantly!What follows is a series of observations so obvious that they can only read as condescending. It reads like a high school essay on teamwork: ""Communication is hard, yet it is the most fundamental thing we do as human beings,"" Slack writes. (As I read this I imagined Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who has two master's degrees, furiously nodding and scribbling down notes. ""Cortana, remind me to send Slack a thank-you note,"" I imagine him barking into his Surface Studio. ""They have done us all great service this day.) More from The Verge: MacBook Pro review: the Air apparent The first Google Tango phone delivers true augmented reality gaming The SPUD is an absurd 24-inch portable display that opens like an umbrella   Slack goes on to say that ""an open platform is essential"" — an intriguing point to make for a company that bans third-party clients and maintains total control over which apps are listed in its directory. In any case, the joke was on Slack, as Microsoft Teams allows integrations with approved third parties just like Slack does. :EYE-ROLL:For its big conclusion, Slack declares that the secret ingredient in great enterprise software is — paging Professor Frink — love. ""If you want customers to switch to your product, you're going to have to match our commitment to their success and take the same amount of delight in their happiness,"" Slack writes. This is wishful thinking: I bet Netscape told itself the same thing about Navigator the day Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer with Windows. Microsoft can scoop up millions of users just by bundling Teams with Office 365, and that's exactly why the company did it.A day later, the main thing people know about Microsoft Teams is that it fills Slack with existential dread — which is, of course, a compelling reason to go try it out. Any heightened market awareness Slack gained from advertising in the Times is overshadowed by the anxiety bubbling up from every word in its letter.The truth is that at this point there's no particular reason to believe Teams will sway Slack's fortunes one way or another. Maybe it will blunt the company's already-slightly-slowing growth, particularly for the 85 million people who already have Office 365 subscriptions. Or maybe it will evaporate into the ether, like Yammer, which Microsoft spent $1.2 billion on to seemingly no effect whatsoever.In any case, there's nothing to be gained from posting disingenuous open letters to the competition. The last tech company we saw do it was the similarly beloved music streaming service Rdio, which ""welcomed"" the arrival of Apple Music with a note on Twitter.@Rdio Tweet  Rdio put a lot of love into its product, too.

Google is seeking a new head of Americas policy, it added.""I am comfortable in making the transition,"" said Molinari, 60, who had served as vice chair of the House Republican Conference before resigning from Congress in 1997 to become a Saturday morning news anchor on CBS. She added in a statement that she had been ""looking for the right time to step back.""Alphabet faced criticism from Republicans and Democrats for refusing to send parent company Chief Executive Larry Page or Google CEO Sundar Pichai to a Senate hearing in September, where senators left an empty chair next to Twitter Inc's CEO Jack Dorsey and Facebook Inc's chief operating officer.Pichai in September canceled a trip to Asia to meet with lawmakers and agreed to testify before Congress later this year.Google also has faced this year numerous accusations from President Donald Trump and other Republican leaders that its search results promote content critical of conservatives and demote right-leaning news outlets, a charge that Google denies.Lawmakers have questioned whether it would accept China's censorship demands as it considers reentering the search engine market there. Last month, Vice President Mike Pence called on Google to abandon the Chinese project.Pichai said at a forum on Thursday that the project was ""more of an experiment"" and reiterated that there is ""nothing imminent"" on a whether it will launch a search engine in China.In June, Google hired Karan Bhatia as global head of policy from General Electric Co.

599,2016-11-01T17:07:38-0400," Microsoft said on Tuesday that a hacking group previously linked to the Russian government and U.S. political hacks is behind recent cyber attacks that exploit a newly discovered flaw in its Windows operating system.Microsoft said that a patch to defend Windows users against this sort of attack will be released on Nov. 8.The software maker said in an advisory on its website there had been a small number of attacks using ""spear phishing"" emails from a hacking group known Strontium, which is more widely known as ""Fancy Bear"" or APT 28.Microsoft did not identify any victims of the attacks.  A U.S. intelligence expert on Russian cyber activity said that Fancy Bear primarily works for or on behalf of the GRU, Russia's military intelligence agency, which U.S. intelligence officials have concluded were responsible for hacks of Democratic Party databases and emails.Microsoft said the attacks exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Systems' Flash software and one in the Windows operating system.Adobe released a patch for that vulnerability on Monday as security researchers with Google went public with details on the attack.Microsoft chided rival Google for going public with details of the vulnerabilities before it had time to prepare and test a patch to fix them.""Google's decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,"" Microsoft said."
600,2016-11-01T10:24:56-0400,"  Amazon's Web Services (AWS) model is dominating the cloud computing market to such an extent that it is now bigger than respective technologies from Google, Microsoft and IBM combined, according to Synergy Research Group.  The latest quarterly analysis report from Synergy suggests AWS accounts for 45 percent of the worldwide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) market. IaaS is a form of cloud computing, which Amazon helped to create, that provides virtual computing resources online for the public. Crucially, this technology only charges customers for what they use.  The other two major cloud technologies include Platform as a Service (Paas) and managed private cloud services. PaaS allows customers to develop and manage its applications on the cloud meanwhile private cloud differs from the public service as it is dedicated to a single organization.  Amazon also powers ahead of its competitors in terms of market share in the PaaS sector though Microsoft, IBM and Salesforce  collectively total slightly more than its AWS rival.  However, in the managed private cloud sector, IBM boasts a healthy lead over its next three rivals followed by Rackspace, NTT and AWS.   John Dinsdale, chief analyst and research director at Synergy Research Group said in the report, ""Scale is the name of the game, especially in the public cloud markets.""   John Rymer, vice president and principal analyst with Forrester Research believes AWS is indeed as dominant as Synergy's research suggests though cited growth in enterprises as a key reason for Amazon's rivals to be hopeful.  He told CNBC in an email, ""AWS is in fact that much bigger than its rivals. But there's still plenty of room for growth, particularly in enterprises.  ""Expect continued investment in data centers and in application services by the top 4 vendors,"" he added.   According to the Synergy research report, Amazon, Microsoft and Google have continued to invest huge sums into their respective cloud computing technologies with all three expanding their data center footprints and announcing more geographic locations in the coming months.  Dinsdale added, ""This scale is the primary reason why they are able to gain market share and pressure smaller players into consolidation or refocusing their cloud activities.  ""Some tier 2 players are looking to buck the trend and at least some are seeing particularly strong growth, including Alibaba (particularly in IaaS) and Oracle (in PaaS),"" he said. "
601,2016-10-28T09:13:36-0400,"  Apple and Microsoft have both announced new computers this week built for professionals, and while the companies' hardware may be very different, the way they're selling these new devices is eerily similar. Check out the MacBook Pro overview from Apple above, then watch Microsoft's introduction for the Surface Studio. Okay, so one has a Jony Ive voiceover and the other has a dramatic cover of ""Pure Imagination,"" but the general arc of the videos — the narrative they're trying to tell the consumer — is the same.   We start with the camera lingering on polished, machined surfaces; gleaming chrome and impregnable aluminum. The inner components break apart as if in zero gravity, giving us a chance to see how each individual part fits together, and then the whole thing reassembles like a slow-mo explosion in reverse. A human enters the frame, touching the computer and bringing it to life. For Microsoft that means adjusting the Studio's display, for Apple it's activating the Touch Bar, but the meaning is shared — we put all this together. Even the test footage used to show off the screens is the same: explosions of colorful powder surely inspired by photographs of the Hindu festival of Holi.  More from the Verge: Apple announces new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar Can we stop connected gadgets from taking down the internet?  The 8 biggest announcements from yesterday's Microsoft event   Of course, none of this cinematography is uncommon (what's rare is Apple and Microsoft announcing new computers back to back). Tech companies of all stripes have been using the slow-mo-component-explosion shot for years as way to show off the engineering that's gone into making these devices. What's perhaps most interesting is the reactions to the two videos. The Apple one seems unremarkable, but Microsoft's is genuinely exciting.  The question is: why? It could be a result of over-familiarity with Jony Ive videos, which follow a familiar cadence but are so unchanging they almost slip into self-parody. It could be that Microsoft's video is just better — the music pushes all sorts of emotional buttons, and we get to see the Studio and its peripherals just do more. But there might also be a larger issue with brand. Both companies seem like they're repositioning themselves; with Microsoft pushing into the professional creative market, and Apple moving the MBP more mainstream (e.g. emoji on the Touch Bar). The former move is, to me at least, more exciting. "

605,2016-10-21T09:11:16-0400," Steve Ballmer told CNBC on Friday he never sought to purchase Twitter — responding to speculation that he and fellow billionaire Saudi Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal were looking to make a bid.   The former CEO of Microsoft and Al-Waleed are major shareholders of Twitter, which was recently said to be seeking buyout offers.   ""I have never, ever, ever wanted to buy Twitter myself. I got a good life right now. I don't need to do that,"" the Los Angeles Clippers owner said on ""Squawk Box."" ""I'm having a lot of fun with the Clips. I'm having a lot of fun with my wife, doing some stuff at the Ballmer Group that we think is fun philanthropically."" Google, Disney, and Salesforce were among the companies rumored to be initially interested. But one by one, they bowed out. Ballmer said he had thought Google could have been a good fit since it's already working to surface tweets in search.   ""I don't think there's any substitute in the market [for Twitter]. It's sort of an irreproducible asset,"" said Ballmer, who also was critical of Jack Dorsey's arrangement as CEO of both Twitter and Square. ""That's a weird deal.""   ""There is an asset there ... with the right time, with the right leader that thing could be really made into something great,"" Ballmer said.   ""It's a really good company, obviously with some work to do. Just think about this election, would this election have been the same without Twitter, without [Donald] Trump banging out those late night tweets? I don't think so.""   Ballmer also reflected on his time at Microsoft and what the company is doing right now. He said current CEO Satya Nadella is doing a good job building out Microsoft's cloud strategy, which boosted quarterly earnings and revenue.   Ballmer, whose fortune is largely in Microsoft stock, cheered Friday's premarket surge, which would put shares at their first all-time high since 1999.   The tech giant has made the transition from a company focusing on servicing personal computers to an enterprise company, he said. ""It's a fantastic company.""   Ballmer, who ran Microsoft from 2000 to 2014, said his worst mistake as CEO was the 2007, $6.3 billion acquisition of aQuantive, an online display ad firm. ""It was probably what I'd call just, a blow into a gale force wind. It was dumb.""   In 2012, Microsoft took a $6.2 billion writedown on the aQuantive deal.   Another ill-fated deal was Microsoft's $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia's smartphone business. The deal, announced in 2013 shortly after Ballmer said he would be stepping down, was finalized in 2015.   A year later, Microsoft wrote off the purchase, and sold the assets to subsidiary of Taiwan-based Foxconn Technology and newly established firm HMD Global for $350 million.   Ballmer told CNBC: ""The phone business, I'm not apologetic about. Current management chose to go in a different direction.""  "
606,2016-10-21T18:54:18-0400," Microsoft's win streak in cloud could be a sign that the company is hitting a turning point, one analyst told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" on Friday.   ""I think this is really the inflection point, you're going to see gross margins steadily move up from the 40 level to the 50s and maybe even into the 60 percent range as we get a year out,"" said Kirk Materne, managing director of equity research at Evercore Partners.  Shares of the technology company hit an all-time high on Friday, breaking through their 1999 dot-com era peak to close up 4.2 percent. It followed a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report.    The company posted adjusted first-quarter earnings per share of 76 cents on revenue of $22.33 billion. Wall Street also expected Microsoft to report earnings of about 68 cents a share on $21.71 billion in revenue, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate.   The company also said its cloud revenue grew 116 percent.    Materne said the company is at the cusp of a multiyear growth cycle, as investments in the company's cloud technology start to pay off.    ""Cloud is a once-in-a-generation technology transformation that is happening,"" Neeraj Agrawal, a general partner at venture capital firm Battery Ventures, told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" He said the company's best quarters are ahead of them. ""Very impressive. I think there is a lot more to go from here.""   Microsoft indeed tends to outperform a month after beating earnings expectations by a margin of 1.5 standard deviations or more, according to Kensho data.     ""Typically after a move like this, you get follow-through,"" said Carter Worth, head of technical analysis at Cornerstone Macro, on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" Morgan Stanley managing director Keith Weiss said the company was ""hitting all cylinders.""   Nineteen analysts listed in FactSet raised their price targets on the stock. But despite the company's solid results, not every Wall Street analyst was convinced.    ""The lamest thing a sell-side analyst does is downgrade a plummeting stock after a miss,"" wrote Richard Davis of Canaccord Genuity. ""The second worst action is to upgrade a stock after a good print and the stock has popped. The latter explains our reluctance to upgrade MSFT from HOLD to Buy today.""  — CNBC's Christine Wang contributed to this report. "

610,2018-10-19T07:00:00-0400,"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - The pressure is on for Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft as they prepare to report quarterly results at a time when confidence in those market leaders looks increasingly fragile and in danger of derailing Wall Street's rally.After worries about higher interest rates sparked a steep sell-off in early October and again on Thursday, the S&amp;P 500 remains down 5 percent from its Sept. 20 record high close, with top-shelf stocks including Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc , Netflix Inc and Facebook Inc showing little of their vitality from recent years.A quarterly report from Microsoft Corp on Wednesday after the bell, followed by Alphabet and Amazon late on Thursday, will influence sentiment across Wall Street.""The equity market is at a critical point here,"" said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager, Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. ""In order for it not to get a lot worse, I think you need to see Amazon and Alphabet put up some good numbers.""With investors worried about increased internet regulation and criticism of Facebook's handling of user data, the social media company's stock has slumped 29 percent from its record high on July 25. Alphabet is 15 percent below its July 26 record high close, while Amazon has fallen 12 percent this month.Microsoft has also stalled after doubling over the past two years.Still, Netflix and Amazon remain up 81 percent and 51 percent year to date, respectively, underscoring their places among Wall Street's crEeme de la crEeme. The S&amp;P 500's largest component, Apple Inc has gained 28 percent in 2018, even after falling 7 percent from its record high on Oct. 3.A 5 percent surge in Netflix on Wednesday after its upbeat quarterly report allayed fears the video streaming company was losing steam.But that did little to perk up its fellow stocks in the so-called FANG group that also includes Amazon, Google-parent Alphabet and Facebook. In the past, those stocks have often risen together.Powerful rallies by Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Netflix in recent years have made them must-own stocks for portfolio managers, making their ownership so widespread that they are at risk of a major sell-off should a majority of investors' views about them change for the worse.""So many funds are invested in the same stocks. They got less crowded in the past week, but at this point it's difficult to say if we are going to shrug everything off and go to new highs a month from now, or if we're going to test more lows,"" warned Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas.The recent slide has left Amazon and Facebook trading at discounted multiples of their expected earnings. Amazon's forward price-to-earnings ratio last week touched 74, a seven-year low, according to Refinitiv data. Facebook this month traded as little as 18 times expected earnings, the lowest since its 2012 public listing.ROBUST EARNINGS GROWTHHelped by a strong economy and deep corporate tax cuts, S&amp;P 500 earnings per share are expected to grow 22 percent in the third quarter, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. But some investors are already eyeing slower growth in 2019, when the corporate tax cut benefits will be a year old and no longer create an extra boost.Investors are also nervous about potential fallout from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade conflict with Beijing, and higher interest rates as the strong U.S. economy and low unemployment pressure prices.Propelled by its cloud computing business, Amazon is expected by analysts to report a September-quarter non-GAAP net profit of $1.54 billion, or $3.12 per share, compared to just $256 million a year ago, according to Refinitiv.Alphabet's September-quarter non-GAAP net profit is seen rising 9 percent to $7.36 billion, or $10.43 per share.Microsoft's non-GAAP net income is seen rising 13 percent to $7.46 billion, or 96 cents per share.Facebook reports its quarterly results on Oct. 30, followed on Nov. 1 by Apple.Amazon and Alphabet are widely considered technology companies. However, within S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices' Global Industry Classification Standard, Amazon falls into the consumer discretionary sector and Alphabet belongs to the recently renamed communication services sector.

611,2016-10-19T15:50:43-0400,"  Even if Microsoft reports fiscal first quarter earnings that beat analyst expectations, that might not be enough to prevent some investors from selling the stock if its cloud business results disappoint, said Pacific Crest analyst Brent Bracelin.   Analysts expect Microsoft to report earnings per share of 68 cents on revenue of $21.7 billion, according to estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. If Microsoft's quarterly revenue delivers on that expectation, this would stop a revenue slide that dates back five quarters.    But the focus for investors on Thursday will be how effectively Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is driving the technology giant towards a future of growth via its cloud-based software and services, Office 365 and Microsoft Azure. Microsoft's stock is trading up around 3.8 percent so far this year. The S&amp;P 500 is up around 5 percent.   ""We think of Office 365 and we think of Azure as really being the two most important growth drivers to the business,"" RBC Capital Markets' analyst Ross MacMillan. For a preview of what could happen to Microsoft if fails to deliver on cloud, just look to IBM's stock this week, said Bracelin.  On Monday, IBM reported quarterly earnings per share and and revenue that beat analyst expectations, but the stock traded down following those results because investors were disappointed with margins declines in the company's cloud business.   ""It isn't whether they slightly beat revenue, or slightly miss revenue, it's really about that cloud transition, because that's the future of these companies,"" he said.   Institutional investors are watching closely to see how well these tech dinosaurs are managing the transition to new lower-margin cloud-based businesses, which will impact their future earnings power, said Bracelin. Microsoft recognizes the need to bring visibility to this important segment of the business and last quarter revealed its commercial cloud margins for the first time, and announced it would continue to do so.   ""It is important because these are large companies that historically had large installed bases and they historically had high margin profiles and so you are going from a legacy business that had high margins to a newer immature business that's growing fast,"" said Bracelin.   The average gross margin for Microsoft across all of its businesses was 64 percent last quarter, and investors have become accustomed to those sorts of returns. The problem is, the higher margin segments of the business are in decline, while the lower margin cloud segments are growing, and cannibalizing those older businesses putting further pressure on earnings results.  Investors are likely to become nervous if cloud computing gross margins do not at least match the 42 percent figure Microsoft reported last quarter, despite several quarters of consecutive margin declines in this segment of the business, said Bracelin.   Microsoft expects commercial cloud gross margins to improve for the year, said CFO Amy Hood said last quarter. That said, the trend over the past three quarters has been declining margins, as Microsoft invests in things like giant cloud data centers to serve a growing roster of multinational customers. In the past several months, Microsoft announced it had added Adobe and Boeing to its Azure cloud customer list.    Like rival and cloud leader Amazon, Microsoft has significantly invested in a large data center footprint to serve these enterprise giants which are also transitioning their businesses to become cloud-based operations.   ""These are global entities, and so they need someone that has invested billions and billions of dollars in a data center footprint in specific countries that they might have operations,"" said Bracelin.  The December quarter is likely to mark an inflection point for commercial cloud gross margins — from that point on, margins should pivot to growth, said RBC's McMallan.   Pacific Crest is looking for Microsoft to report a $12.2 billion annual revenue run-rate for its commercial cloud business, which would equate to 49 percent year-over-year growth."
612,2016-10-20T16:47:06-0400,"  Wall Street apparently thinks that Microsoft's turnaround strategy is working out.    On Thursday, the company reported fiscal first-quarter earnings results and a commercial cloud annual revenue run rate of more than $13 billion. The stock spiked up more than 5 percent in after-hours trading.    Institutional investors have been laser focused on this number, looking for proof that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is successfully leading the company away from old businesses into high-growth cloud services.   Analysts had been looking for a lower annual revenue run rate closer to $12 billion, so this figure came as a nice surprise. Most importantly to Wall Street, the company also grew margins for the commercial cloud segment, showing it's able to squeeze more money out of its lower-margin cloud business. The company increased commercial cloud margins to 49 percent, up from 42 percent last quarter, handily beating analyst expectations.   ""Our first-quarter results showed continued demand for our cloud-based services,"" said Amy Hood, executive vice president and chief financial officer of Microsoft, in an earnings press release. ""We continue to invest, position ourselves for long-term growth and execute well across our businesses.""   Microsoft's cloud divisions, Productivity and Business Processes which encompasses Office 365, and Intelligent Cloud which includes Microsoft Azure, delivered $6.7 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively.    With these strong cloud results, Microsoft seems to have won over investors, many of whom were spooked earlier this week when IBM  reported disappointing results for its cloud business.  Here are all the details on Microsoft's earnings. "
613,2016-10-19T08:00:00-0400,"  Microsoft is set to surge after it reports earnings, predicts one trader who could make more than five times his money off a Microsoft bet.   Microsoft has surged more than 19 percent since its Brexit low in June. And though the stock has traded in a range for most of the summer, Andrew Keene of AlphaShark sees good signs in the charts for the tech giant, especially with earnings as a ""catalyst"" for Microsoft.   ""It has rallied five of the last eight quarters on earnings,"" Keene said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Trading Nation."" ""Combine that with the chart, and I think Microsoft is going higher.""   On a daily chart of Microsoft, Keene says that the stock has consolidated since jumping off of the company's last earnings beat in July. While Microsoft has been trading in a range of $56 to $59, the stock has generally managed to stay above its 50-day moving average, which indicates to Keene that this smoothing mechanism is serving as support.   Meanwhile, Microsoft's weekly chart shows what Keene terms a ""bull channel,"" and based on that trend, Keene believes that Microsoft could be headed to $62.50. In other words, Keene sees Microsoft climbing more than 8 percent in the short term, especially if the company's past earnings trends repeat. To take advantage of this expected move, Keene is buying the November 60-strike calls and selling the November 62.50-strike calls for a total cost of $0.45 per share, or $45 per options spread. If Microsoft closes at or above $62.50 at the trade's expiration on November 18, this ""call spread"" will be worth $250, meaning that Keene will have quintupled his money.    ""We have that measured move target to $62.50, so I think this is a great reward-to-risk set-up in Microsoft playing into earnings,"" said Keene.   Microsoft is currently up 4 percent year to date and closed Tuesday trading at $57.66. The tech giant is expected to report earnings on Thursday after the closing bell. "

615,2016-10-12T06:44:50-0400,"  Microsoft is pushing its ""mixed reality"" HoloLens headset into six new countries, the company said on Wednesday, as it looks to gain broader appeal for the nascent technology.  HoloLens, released in the U.S. way back in January 2015, is a headset that projects holographic images onto the real world. Users can interact with the things they see through gestures. Microsoft calls this ""mixed reality"" as it merges the digital and real world.   The device is based on Windows 10 and is powered by an operating system called Windows Holographic.  HoloLens is very different device from many of the virtual reality (VR) headsets that are currently on the market such as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive. These involve a user being completely immersed in a virtual world. Instead, HoloLens blends the real and virtual world in an augmented reality.   Customers in France, Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand will now be able to pre-order the device which is expected to ship later this year. In the U.K. the HoloLens costs £2,719, while the U.S. price is $3,000.  It's a device that's aimed squarely at enterprise customers, not consumers just yet. NASA, elevator maker Thyssenkrupp and aerospace and defence giant Airbus, are among the customers using HoloLens in their businesses.   At a demonstration in London, Thyssenkrupp showed how their engineers were given HoloLens to help them repair elevators. An engineer can load Skype on HoloLens and speak to an expert in an office who can see what the engineer sees. The office-based person can actually draw over the real world, to circle key components that need changing or point to a specific part that the engineer needs to look at. Thyssenkrupp said that it is cutting a job that would typically take two hours down to 20 minutes.   In one example, Microsoft used a fake watch brand to show how HoloLens could be used in product development or selling to consumers. Last year, Microsoft struck a partnership with Volvo Cars, with part of the deal involving the automaker putting HoloLens inside their showrooms to help customers explore a vehicle in a virtual way.    Ben Reed, HoloLens' head of strategy, said focusing on enterprise customers to begin with will allow it to grow the number of use cases for the headsets.   ""The focus on commercial customers is about building an ecosystem so if and when we are focusing on the consumer market there will be an exosystem of experiences to support that,"" Reed told CNBC in an interview.   The Microsoft executive also added that currently there are 80 third party individual developer experiences in the HoloLens app store.   The market for these kind of virtual and mixed reality devices has the potential to be huge. Worldwide revenues for the augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) market will grow from $5.2 billion in 2016 to more than $162 billion in 2020,"" according to IDC.    But Microsoft will need to expand the reach of Windows Holographic - the operating system powering HoloLens - in order to get more developers on board and increase the appeal of the device. In June, Microsoft announced that it was opening up Windows Holographic to be used by other headset makers in a bid to widen its reach.  "
616,2016-10-07T06:20:50-0400,"Dell EMC has poached Microsoft's head of mergers and acquisitions operations in Europe and Israel to run its venture capital arm, a source close to the situation told CNBC.    Yair Snir, who was previously the director of M&amp;A and business development at Microsoft in Europe and Israel, has moved over to Dell EMC to head up Dell Technologies Capital, the firm's venture arm.  Snir started the role this week, but his LinkedIn profile has not changed to reflect the move.   The position Snir left vacant at Microsoft is currently still open. Neither Microsoft nor Dell EMC have responded to a request for comment.   Dell Technologies Capital will focus on equity investments in early and late stage start-ups in areas including storage, security, hybrid cloud and big data, the source said.    Dell completed its $60 billion deal to buy EMC last month. As part of that deal, EMC Ventures, the company's VC division was incorporated into Dell Technologies  "
617,2016-10-04T06:31:01-0400,"Microsoft announced Tuesday it was expanding its strategic partnership with ABB, just as the Swiss engineering firm was rebuffing investor calls to split up its business.It was a busy day in Zurich for ABB, with a slew of headlines from the multinational corporation which operates in robotics, and power and automation technologies. The strategic partnership with Microsoft will allow its customers to access the U.S. tech giant's cloud technology.ABB's already has 70 million connected devices installed and more than 70,000 digital control systems, and with Microsoft it aims to ""develop one of the world's largest industrial cloud platforms.""  ""Together with ABB, we are providing industrial customers with the digital technology and cloud platform to empower every person, team and business system within an organization to glean new insights and drive faster decision making to seize new growth and opportunities,"" said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, in a press release on Tuesday morning.   But the announcements didn't stop there. ABB said it would step up cost savings and launch a new share buyback program. It also stated it would keep its power grids division, despite grumblings from activist investors.      Ulrich Spiesshofer, CEO of ABB, told CNBC Tuesday it would keep the unit as the board decided it was the best option to create value for shareholders. Accusations center on the low profitability of the power grid unit but Spiesshofer was quick to highlight that it was still a profit leader in the industry.   ""We have listened to all the expressed views, very, very carefully. We have listened to our customers. We have listened to the market. We have worked out a great transformation program to create a substantial value creation story for our shareholders going forward,"" he said.   International investment firm Cevian Capital, which has 10 billion euros ($11.2 billion) in assets under management on Tuesday expressed regret at ABB's decision not separate and reduce the complexity of the conglomerate.   ""ABB is a collection of top-quality businesses whose performance has been hindered for many years by the company's conglomerate structure. The potential is 35 Swiss francs ($35.7) per share in today's terms"" Lars Förberg, a managing partner and co-founder of Cevian Capital, said in a statement.   ""The board has decided to keep the conglomerate structure. We think this is an unfortunate decision. The board and management team will be held accountable for realizing 35 Swiss francs. The time horizon is now. ABB has under delivered during a long time period. Therefore, we are already in 'the long term',"" he added.  "
618,2016-09-28T08:00:00-0400,"Microsoft Chairman John Thompson spent a decade at the helm of security software developer Symantec. Since he stepped down in 2009, cyberthreats have gotten significantly more sophisticated and pervasive, which helps explain his latest bet.Contrast Security, a Silicon Valley start-up whose software protects applications from attack, said Wednesday that Thompson joined a $16 million investment in the company. The deal was led by venture firm General Catalyst Partners.Founded in 2014, Contrast was designed for a new era of software development. All types of companies — banks, retailers, automakers — now employ developers who are writing code, sharing it with co-workers, and pushing it to any number of devices and servers. Every step of the way that code can be corrupted by hackers.Contrast is deployed at the beginning stages of software development to keep the bad guys out throughout the whole process. On the other side, the start-up's products can be used by companies that are constantly using new apps and programs, which all need to be vetted and monitored to make sure they don't contain malicious code. ""We've got to start to rethink the application security paradigm, not just the information security paradigm,"" Thompson said in an interview. ""There have not been a lot of ideas that have emerged in that domain.""Security breaches are getting more frequent and extreme, seemingly by the day. Yahoo said last week that 500 million customer accounts had been stolen, marking potentially the biggest hack in history.   In response, companies and governments are expected to spend $202 billion a year on cybersecurity tools by 2021, up 66 percent from this year, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets. Thompson, who ran Symantec from 1999 to 2009 and remained as chairman for another two years, joined Microsoft's board in 2012 and spearheaded the search for Steve Ballmer's successor as the software company's CEO. Ultimately, Satya Nadella was promoted to the top job in February 2014, and at the same time Thompson was named chairman of Microsoft's board.Since leaving Symantec, Thompson has invested in about 20 start-ups in security, storage and data analytics. He was also CEO of performance analytics start-up Virtual Instruments from 2010 until earlier this year. His tenure there ended in disappointment when Virtual Instruments hit a growth roadblock and merged with Load DynamiX in March.Thompson brings obvious security expertise to Contrast. But his role at Microsoft could also be beneficial.All apps are moving to the cloud, where they're typically hosted by big infrastructure vendors like Amazon, Google, IBM or Microsoft. Amazon Web Services is by far the market leader and currently the only one that counts Contrast as a formal partner.   Contrast CEO Alan Naumann said there are four to five cloud vendors, including Microsoft's Azure service, that would make for natural partners.   The company also teams up with services like corporate chat providers Slack and Atlassian's HipChat, because those are popular tools for developers in collaborating and communicating. Contrast wants to be wherever developers are working.   ""The deployment model is to give a copy for every developer and every application,"" said Naumann. ""Our tech goes everywhere the app goes.""   Contrast is still in its early days, but the company has signed up more than 60 clients, Naumann said. He wouldn't give Contrast's exact head count, saying only that it has 50 to 100 employees and plans to quickly double.    That was all more than enough to get Thompson excited.   ""I would've loved to have put in more money than where I ended up,"" he said. "
619,2016-09-22T13:36:23-0400,"A few companies like Microsoft are continuing to buy back billions in their own stock, but last quarter saw a significant decline in the number of companies making such large repurchases. The number of S&amp;P 500 companies with buybacks over $1 billion dropped to a 3-year low in the second quarter of 2016, according to data released by FactSet this week. Overall, fewer companies were opting to buy back any stock at all, marking the lowest participation rate since the end of 2010. Microsoft announced Wednesday that it was authorizing up to $40 billion in buybacks. (The software company did not reveal a timeframe for the buybacks and told CNBC it has ""nothing further to share"" on timing.)In the last quarter, we've seen other big spenders including Apple ($10.9 billion) and GE ($7.6 billion). Those two companies are also leading the market for most stock repurchased in the last 12 months.  In the last decade, companies have spent large sums on stock buybacks, which are often used to boost the price of the remaining shares and to prop up per-share earnings.    Despite the decline in buybacks last quarter, S&amp;P 500 companies are still using an extremely large amount of their income to buy back their own shares. They spent nearly 72 percent of net income over the last 12 months on buybacks — up about 17 percent from a year ago.    With debt high and earnings expected to fall, buybacks will likely be even less affordable in coming quarters, especially if the U.S. Federal Reserve decides to raise interest rates. Put Microsoft's $40 billion purchase in context: If the company does buy that full amount, and it doesn't reissue any of those shares, then that $40 billion alone would be bigger than most S&amp;P 500 companies have done in total over the last 10 years.   Only 14 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have spent at least $40 billion in net stock buybacks over the past decade. The leaders include ExxonMobil ($189 billion), Apple  ($111 billion), IBM ($109 billion), Microsoft ($101 billion), Walmart ($66 billion), Pfizer  ($60 billion), Procter and Gamble ($48 billion), Home Depot ($47 billion), and HP ($47 billion).       There is some evidence that buybacks may not help support a company's share price over the long term. FactSet's data showed that companies with repurchase programs have underperformed the S&amp;P 500 in the past year by more than 5 percentage points.    The Fed decided to leave rates unchanged in its September meeting on Wednesday, but if credit tightens, more companies may find that burning cash or taking out debt for buybacks simply aren't worth the cost.

620,2016-09-22T06:06:54-0400,"Computer users have faced major technical issues with Microsoft's new Windows 10 software since its launch in July last year, according to research by U.K. consumer charity Which.""We've received well over 1,000 complaints about Windows 10, as well as plenty of comments ... with PC users telling us that this software update has brought them nothing but problems,"" Andrew Laughlin, a senior researcher at the consumer association, said in a blogpost on Thursday.Consumers in the U.K. have told the company about being ""nagged"" by Microsoft to install the operating system update and, despite declining advances, have experienced the Windows 10 software installing itself anyway.   Various problems, once it is installed, have included printers, wi-fi cards and speakers no longer working, as well as instances of lost files and email accounts no longer syncing, according to Which.   ""In some cases, members' computers were so badly affected that they had to pay someone to repair it,"" Laughlin stated.   A spokesperson for Microsoft told CNBC via email that the Windows 10 upgrade is a ""choice designed to help people take advantage of the most secure, and most productive version of Windows.""  In June, Which surveyed 5,500 of its members, according to the BBC. The results showed that 12 percent of the 2,500 who had upgraded to Windows 10 had later reverted to an earlier version. Which has called on Microsoft to do better, adding that the tech giant is offering free support to anyone affected by Windows 10 upgrade.   ""With more than 350 million monthly active devices now running Windows 10, the vast majority of customers who have upgraded to Windows 10 over the past year have had a seamless, positive experience,"" the Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.   ""For the relatively small number of users who may have issues with their upgrade experience, Microsoft offers a variety of options to get assistance including free customer support."" "
621,2016-09-19T10:09:45-0400,"Salesforce.com founder Marc Benioff has done his part to revolutionize the software industry, and he's far from done.Back when Benioff was a top executive at Oracle in the 1990s, salespeople stored client and prospect data on proprietary machines that required expertise to use. Marketing teams had separate tools as did customer support representatives. Data was siloed, limiting the capabilities of analysis and business intelligence software.Fast forward two decades and Benioff hast turned that model on its head. Salesforce is a $50 billion enterprise that businesses rely on to connect their sales, marketing, support and financials in the cloud — a term that didn't exist when the company was launched in 1999. Rather than mimicking Oracle and trying to do everything, Salesforce has enabled scores of niche software developers to plug their apps into the platform and get instant access to many thousands of prospective customers. AppExchange, as it's known, features more than 3,000 products, some from companies that have built billion-dollar businesses on top of Salesforce. Now that Salesforce has over 150,000 businesses spending $8 billion a year on its customer relationship management (CRM) software and other products, Benioff is attempting to take the next giant step into the future. Enter artificial intelligence.At next month's Dreamforce, Salesforce's mammoth annual customer conference that takes over downtown San Francisco, the company will introduce technology called Einstein, which it's describing as the ""world's first comprehensive AI for CRM."" On the company's second-quarter conference call in August, Benioff called it ""AI for everyone.""Salesforce executives on Thursday gave a group of reporters an early look at Einstein in preparation for the unveiling. The general idea, as the name implies, is that sales tools are getting a whole lot smarter.Who are the best prospects to call this week? Which leads are most likely to become prospective clients? Why am I getting outsold by my competitors in certain markets? How long will it take a deal to close?These are the types of questions that Einstein aims to answer, in turn leading to more frequent conversions and more efficient sales teams. The same technology can be applied to marketing, customer support and commerce data, thanks to a team of 175 data scientists and a string of deep technology acquisitions. Developers on AppExchange will get to utilize the same AI software in deploying their own apps.""Each and every product that we market and sell will be impacted by AI,"" said Alex Dayon, president and chief product officer at the San Francisco-based company. ""It's really an investment for the long run.""According to CB Insights, more than 30 private companies working to advance artificial intelligence have been acquired in the past five years, and Salesforce has been among the most active buyers along with Alphabet, Intel and Apple. Salesforce's Chief Scientist Richard Socher joined the company in April through the acquisition of deep learning start-up MetaMind.Investors know Einstein is coming but they've yet to get much detail on it. Of late, they haven't been so bullish. The stock has dropped 6.5 percent this year, while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 4.7 percent.Still, the company is richly valued compared to its peers at 6.8 times revenue, compared with a price-to-sales ratio of 4.4 for Oracle, 5.4 for Microsoft and 1.8 for IBM, according to FactSet.""All eyes shift to Dreamforce in early October with the release of Einstein and discussion around long-term targets,"" Joel Fishbein, an analyst at BTIG, wrote in a Sept. 1 report, following Salesforce's earnings release. ""The company has invested heavily in artificial intelligence (six deals in the past 12 months), and they believe imbuing their platform with machine learning will be the next catalyst for sustained growth."" Fishbein has a buy rating on the stock and a $100 price target, 36 percent above Friday's close of $73.29. One major challenge for Salesforce is renewed competition from Microsoft. While the software giant badly trails Salesforce in CRM, Microsoft is using its dominance in other areas of enterprise technology along with its Azure cloud infrastructure and $100 billion-plus cash pile to regain relevance.Microsoft outbid Salesforce for LinkedIn, giving its customer database called Dynamics a huge data infusion. LinkedIn's network has more than 450 million members who have populated the site with their professional information, potentially providing a whole new way for Microsoft to target workers with relevant stories and connections. Last week, Microsoft Dynamics nabbed HP's CRM business in a six-year deal. Tom Roderick, an analyst at Stifel, said Microsoft is displacing Salesforce and Oracle at HP. ""The move will raise some eyebrows among investors in the cloud world as it is one of the strongest acknowledgments of MSFT's CRM suite we have seen,"" wrote Roderick, who rates Salesforce a buy.Salesforce's Einstein press release has all the buzz phrases, such as deep learning, predictive analytics and natural language processing. Should it all work together as planned, the dream scenario for Salesforce is that its technology becomes so valuable that existing customers buy more of it, and businesses currently favoring Microsoft opt to give Salesforce another look. Salesforce reached $5 billion in annual sales faster than any enterprise software company, and Benioff's goal is to top $10 billion in record time. Analysts predict Salesforce will get there late next year.In striving for that milestone, Benioff told CNBC'S Jim Cramer on  ""Mad Money"" earlier this month that AI is among the next big growth drivers.""It's amazing what is now possible, whether it's machine learning, deep learning, machine intelligence that we're able to do today that we weren't able to do just a couple of years ago,"" Benioff said. ""Our customers are going to get that for the first time in October."""
622,2018-10-29T14:50:00-0400,"(Google corrects the amount it will grant to $25 million, not $20 million, in the headline and 1st paragraph)SUNNYVALE, California Oct 29 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google announced on Monday that it would grant about $25 million globally next year to humanitarian and environmental projects seeking to use artificial intelligence (AI) to speed up and grow their efforts.The ""AI Impact Challenge"" is meant to inspire organizations to ask Google for help in machine learning, a form of AI in which computers analyze large datasets to make predictions or detect patterns and anomalies.Google's rivals Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc tout ""AI for good"" initiatives too.Focusing on humanitarian projects could aid Google in recruiting and soothe critics by demonstrating that its interests in machine learning extend beyond its core business and other lucrative areas, such as military work. After employee backlash Google this year said it would not renew a deal to analyze U.S. military drone footage.Google AI Chief Operating Officer Irina Kofman told Reuters the challenge was not a reaction to such pushback, but noted that thousands of employees are eager to work on ""social good"" projects even though they do directly generate revenue.At a media event on Monday, Google showcased existing projects similar to those it wants to inspire. In one, Google's computers recently learned to detect the singing of humpback whales with 90 percent precision from 170,000 hours of underwater audio recordings gathered by the U.S. government.The audio previously required manual analysis, meaning ""this is the first time this dataset has been looked at in a comprehensive way,"" said Ann Allen, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ecologist.Identifying patterns could show how humans have affected whales' migration, Allen said. Eventually, real-time audio analysis could help ships avoid whale collisions.To be sure, the data have gaps since whales are not always singing, and getting vessels to use animal location data could require new regulation, two whale experts said.Julie Cattiau, a Google product manager for the whale work, said Google plans to make the whale software available to additional organizations to improve.Google will not charge for such tools, Cattiau said, though users could choose to pair them with paid Google cloud services.Jacquelline Fuller, vice president of Google nonprofit arm Google.org, said impact challenge applications would be due Jan. 20 and judged on total potential beneficiaries, feasibility and ethical considerations.This year, Google.org filtered grant applications with its own machine-learning tool for the first time, Fuller said, after receiving a record number of entries for an Africa-specific competition.

623,2019-01-02T19:40:00-0500,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Apple's warning on Wednesday about weak iPhone demand in the holiday quarter is a gloomy omen for Wall Street bulls hoping for an early gift in 2019 following December's steep selloff.After the bell, the Cupertino, California company cut its sales forecast for its quarter ending in December, citing slowing iPhone sales in China.That sent its stock down 7.5 percent after hours and knocked 1.3 percent off S&amp;P 500 futures, suggesting the market was set to open weaker on Thursday as already skittish investors reconsider their earnings expectations for U.S. multinationals.""People are looking for a January rally effect as they place bets for the new year. Apple puts a bit of a sour tone on that,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager of Synovus Trust Co. ""It raises concerns about whether current estimates for the quarter are too high.""Including its after-hours drop on Wednesday, Apple's stock market value has tumbled to below $700 billion from over $1.1 trillion at its peak in October. Although it has fallen behind Amazon and Microsoft in value, Apple remains one of Wall Street's most widely-held companies, and its warning will affect sentiment across the stock market.Following the S&amp;P 500's worst December performance since the Great Depression, many investors this week returned from holidays optimistic that a correction that started last September may have run its course. The S&amp;P 500 on Wednesday was up nearly 7 percent over five sessions from its recent low on Dec. 24.Apple's revised fiscal first-quarter revenue estimate of $84 billion was nearly 12 percent short of the average analyst estimate, even after recent warnings about slow demand from iPhone component suppliers Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo .With the S&amp;P 500 recently trading at 14 times expected earnings, down from 18 times a year ago, a key argument for Wall Street bulls is that the stock market has become undervalued after its recent sell-off. But if Apple's warning is followed by many more, the S&amp;P 500 may appear less of a bargain at current levels.Analysts on average expect S&amp;P 500 companies to increase their earnings per share by nearly 7 percent this year, far below their expectations of 24 percent EPS growth for 2018, according to the most recent estimate from Refinitiv's IBES. At the start of October, analysts had been forecasting 10 percent EPS growth for 2019.Tech sector profit growth, a whopping 29 percent in the third quarter, is expected to slow to 12 percent for the fourth quarter and to dwindle to just 2 percent in the first quarter of 2019, according to the most recent IBES data.

Founded in 2016 by conservative Andrew Torba, Gab bills itself as the ""free speech"" alternative to Twitter Incand Facebook Inc and has become a popular place to post content unwelcome or prohibited on other platforms. Bowers, 46, joined the site in January. Notable users include right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, as well as media personalities Alex Jones and Carl Benjamin. The free website charges for access to additional features and also raises money on the crowdfunding website StartEngine. Torba did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Utsav Sanduja, Gab's former chief operating officer, said the company and its mission will survive ""guilt by association"" and could do more fundraising through cryptocurrencies in order to bypass tech companies. ""We created Gab for the purpose of letting off steam not to kill. That was not our intention,"" he said. In earlier statements, the website said it was cooperating with law enforcement authorities and described the moves by PayPal and others as acts of ""direct collusion between big tech giants."" It also called on U.S. President Donald Trump to act. PayPal declined to comment beyond an earlier statement that the company takes immediate action when ""a site is allowing the perpetuation of hate, violence or discriminatory intolerance."" Joyent could not immediately be reached, and Stripe declined to comment on individual users. Sanduja did say that there could be room for Gab to improve. ""The mission should not change, but certainly there does need to be better checks and balances in place,"" he said. Sanduja said he left his role at the website in June after Gab users threatened his life and that of his wife, who works at a synagogue. On Sunday, Gab's forum lit up with comments about the Pittsburgh attack. One user celebrated Gab being banned by PayPal while another user responded, ""You are going to get shot at ur local synagogue."" Another posted, ""I WAS RIGHT, THEY FAKED THE SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING."" Gab raised $1 million through crowdfunding last year, but recorded a loss of $201,704, according to a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Microsoft Corp said in an emailed statement that it terminated Gab's accounts on its Azure cloud computing platform last month.Alphabet Inc's Google and Apple Inc's mobile app stores previously blocked Gab, cutting off a crucial source of access to new users. Facebook's archive of ads that it considers political in nature shows Gab has run only one such ad since May. It paid less than $100 for that ad and generated 1,000 to 5,000 views last month, according to the archive. The company had no active ad campaigns on Facebook orTwitter Inc as of Saturday, according to those companies' ad transparency databases. Gab's account on Twitter warned users on Saturday to expect that they would be banned from that website and Facebook soon. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company is reviewing Gab's presence on its website. Twitter declined to comment.(Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt and Paresh Dave; Additional reporting by Philip George in Bengaluru; Editing by Daniel Wallis, Meredith Mazzilli and Gopakumar Warrier)"

The software giant released a new build of Windows 10 testers yesterday with very few visible additions, but Windows enthusiasts have already started picking it apart for clues on new features. Twitter user ""Core"" has discovered references to a ""BlueLightReduction"" setting deep within the next major update to Windows 10 (codenamed Redstone 2). It appears to be a setting that will be toggled from the Action Center (notification center) in the operating system.   More from The Verge:Facebook's editorial purge has completely backfiredGoogle is reportedly retiring the Nexus brand nameAcer's Swift 7 is the first laptop thinner than a centimeter  F.lux has been the most popular option for Windows users looking to reduce blue light in the evenings, but Microsoft's own native toggle will bring this feature to every Windows 10 user. Apple  has also integrated a similar feature in iOS 9, but it hasn't announced any plans to bring blue light reduction to Mac OS yet. Microsoft only appears to be testing the feature right now, so there's no guarantee it will ship in the update due early next year. If Microsoft does implement it fully then it will presumably be available on the mobile version of Windows 10, too. "

""I really like Microsoft. I think its cloud activities and also the new management have brought a revival of Bill Gates' initial strategy. I think that's a great company,"" said Robertson. On Air Canada, he said, ""It's an airline that's doing all the right things, and it's priced at about 3.5 times earnings.""    In this wide-ranging conversation, the investor also discusses:   Views on the upcoming presidential election, and why he's voting for Libertarian Gary Johnson.

The pound's fall has affected profitability for many companies, as imported goods have become even more expensive.   Recently, Britain's biggest grocery chain, Tesco, pulled dozens of Unilever brand products from its website after a disagreement over prices, in the wake of a the slump in the British currency.  Unilever had been trying to raise the prices it charges Britain's big four supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - across a wide range of goods by about 10 percent, saying it needs to offset the higher cost of imported commodities.

629,2016-08-23T01:07:45-0400,"  Microsoft said on Monday it has agreed to acquire Genee, an artificial intelligence (AI) app that acts as a digital personal assistant to schedule meetings.   The start-up, which was founded in 2014, will shut down its service on September 1. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed by Genee founders Ben Cheung and Charles Lee, who will join Microsoft.   It's unclear whether the product will be integrated with any of Microsoft's existing applications, but comments from the company suggest Genee's expertise could be used across Microsoft's Office 365 suite of products.   ""As we continue to build new Office 365 productivity capabilities and services our customers value, I'm confident the Genee team will help us further our ambition to bring intelligence into every digital experience,"" Rajesh Jha, Microsoft's corporate vice president of Outlook and Office 365, said in a blog post announcing the deal.  Scheduling meetings can often involve a lot of back and forth over emails, something Genee solved with its solution.    This is how the process works.   A user sends an email to the person they wanted to set up a meeting with and copy in Genee, like a personal assistant. Genee claims to understand the details of the meeting, including the date and location of the meeting.  The app then emails the recipient directly with options that fit the user's calendar and preferences.   Genee can do this because it uses natural language processing, according to the company.    Computers traditionally found it hard to understand normal language, but improvements in AI have now made it possible. So Genee can understand if you want a coffee or lunch, and can also make sense of the time of day you'd like it.    Major tech firms are focusing on bolstering the capabilities of their digital personal assistants. Genee's expertise could be used to improve capabilities of Microsoft's Cortana as it competes with the likes of Google Now and Apple's Siri.    Genee marks the latest acquisition in Microsoft's buying spree, particularly in the productivity and artificial intelligence space -  a big focus for a number of major technology giants.    Last year, Microsoft bought a calendar app Sunrise before shutting it down the following year. And in February 2016, the Redmond, WA-based firm acquired a British AI keyboard app called SwiftKey.    Rivals are also actively looking to boost their AI capabilities. Earlier this year, Apple bought Emotient, a start-up that uses AI to analyze facial expressions, and this month it added machine learnings start-up Turi to its ranks.  "
630,2016-08-17T08:15:44-0400,"  The medical industry could be set for a ""revolution"" with the emergence of more complex artificial intelligence (AI), one of Microsoft's top researchers told CNBC on Wednesday, as technology giants look to enter the health care space.    AI is a broad area, but one part of this called ""machine learning"", can be used to analyze a large amount of data, make predictions, and offer personalized recommendations. In theory, machine learning means that a piece of computer software can learn and get smarter.    Microsoft and other major U.S. technology giants have been investing in AI, acquiring smaller companies, and finding applications.    For Microsoft, the medical industry could be transformed with the tech.    ""I think artificial intelligence is probably the biggest transformation in the IT industry. Medical is such a big area in terms of GDP that that's got to be a good bet,"" Christopher Bishop, lab director at Microsoft Research in Cambridge, U.K., told CNBC in a TV interview.    ""I think the medical domain is set for a revolution.""   The Redmond, WA-based firm has been trialing ways in which AI and machine learning can be used to analyze medical scans of patients. For example, the technology can be used to scan an image of a brain tumor to quantify how big it is, the different tissues it is made up of and then decide on the best course of treatment. This could help doctors discover details about the tumor that they may not have been able to before, or that might have taken a long time to uncover.   Bishop said that as the medical industry becomes more digitized, an increasing amount of data is being produced which can be analyzed to create personalized treatments.    Technology companies see the medical arena as an area in which they can have a big impact. Earlier this year, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said health care is an ""enormous"" opportunity. In June, Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google parent Alphabet predicted that in the next five to ten years, people will be wearing smartwatches that can detect if you have an illnessand will then call your doctor for you.   Health care is certainly one key area of focus, but Bishop also said that AI will make it possible to have a ""personal companion"" able to assist you through life.    ""I think one of the most exciting prospects is the idea of a digital agent, something that can act on our behalf, almost become like a personal companion and that can do many things for us. For example, at the moment, we have to deal with this tremendous complexity of dealing with so many different services and applications, and the digital world feels as if it's becoming ever more complex,"" Bishop told CNBC.    ""But now imagine an agent that can act on your behalf and be the interface between you and that very complex digital world, and furthermore one that would grow with you, and be a very personalized agent, that would understand you and your needs and your experience and so on in great depth.""   He said that people should think of this as something ""rather abstract that lives in the cloud"" and can be accessed through text, voice and gesture.    Currently, digital personal assistants like Microsoft's Cortana, Apple's Siri and Google Now allow users to talk into their devices and receive information. Bishop said these are just ""an early step"" to the longer-term vision.    The idea of having an assistant that can assist you is something that many technology leaders have floated. In January, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said that he planned to build ""a simple AI to run my home and help me with my work"" this year.  "
631,2008-02-14T11:51:59-0500,"Yahoo, which has rejected a $44.6 billion takeover offer from Microsoft, is holding talks with News Corp. about combining MySpace and other News Corp.-owned online properties with Yahoo. A source close to the situation told CNBC that Yahoo's talks with News Corp. focus on the media giant acquiring a stake in Yahoo. Just last week, News Corp. chairman Rupert Murdoch made it clear that News Corp would not buy the whole company. The source stressed that Yahoo is actively considering a series of alternatives, and that Google and Time Warner's AOL are also talking to the company. Under a deal detailed in the Wall Street Journal, News Corp. would get a stake in Yahoo that could be more than 20 percent. Media investor blog Silicon Alley Reporter quoted unnamed sources on Tuesday saying that News Corp and Yahoo are still discussing a possible transaction, but provided no details. According to the Journal, which is also owned by News Corp., the deal under discussion is similar to one considered by the two companies over the past 18 months. The deal would allow Yahoo to remain independent while giving News Corp. substantial control  over a huge array of Internet properties and advertising opportunities, the Journal said. The report came as Yahoo's second-biggest investor urged Microsoftto raise its $42 billion bid for the Web pioneer and warned Yahoo it has few options left, raising the pressure on them to seal a deal. In a quarterly letter to investors released on Tuesday, Bill Miller, the star stock-picker at U.S. asset manager Legg Mason, estimated fair value for Yahoo to be near $40 per share, versus Microsoft's original offer of $31 per share. Microsoft ""will need to enhance its offer if it wants to complete a deal,"" Miller wrote in a February 10 letter, one day before Yahoo formally rejected Microsoft's plan for the company. ""It will be hard for (Yahoo) to come up with alternatives that deliver more value than (Microsoft) will ultimately be willing to pay,"" Miller wrote. ""We think this deal is a strategic imperative for (Microsoft) and that (Yahoo) is in a tough spot if it wishes to remain independent."" Miller's comments came as major institutional Yahoo shareholders have been working behind the scenes to get the parties to strike a deal, analysts say. Around 53 of the top 100 big funds in Yahoo hold shares in both companies, according to the most recent shareholder data available from September. Institutional shareholders hold about 75 percent of Yahoo's stock, according to Reuters data, versus 10 percent for company insiders, including co-founders David Filo and Jerry Yang. Legg Mason Capital Management, the unit of Legg Mason run by Miller, owns more than 80 million Yahoo shares, or 6 percent of the company, trailing only Capital Research &amp; Management's 11 percent holding. Besides talking with News Corp, Yahoo has explored an advertising partnership with its biggest rival, Internet search leader Google.Although Google probably could help elevate Yahoo's recently drooping profits, the alliance would likely face antitrust hurdles because the two companies operate the Web's two biggest ad networks and eliminating one would reduce competition.If Yahoo is able to work out a deal with News Corp, analysts believe Microsoft will simply raise its offer because it needs the acquisition to counteract Google's dominance of the online ad market -- a battleground that is rapidly reshaping the technology and media industries.""Buying Yahoo makes tremendous sense for Microsoft, more sense than any other company in the world,"" said Ken Marlin, a New York investment banker specializing in media and technology deals."
632,2008-02-13T15:54:08-0500,"Are they or aren't they? Only their investment bankers know for sure. Today began with blog rumors of a potential asset swapbetween Yahoo and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., or even an outright competing bid to Microsoft's  $44.6 billion hostile offer.Now there's word from our partners at the Wall Street Journal, citing unnamed sources, that discussions are underway--matching the kinds of discussions that have been making the rounds for the better part of a year; that an asset swap between News Corp. and Yahoo is on the table. The latest speculation has News Corp. swapping its MySpace property to Yahoo, along with some News Corp. cash and cash from an unnamed private equity firm, all for a 20 percent stake in Yahoo. The deal would hinge, however, on MySpace attracting a valuation of between $6 billion and $10 billion. A stretch, to say the least. Such a plan would let Yahoo keep its independence and give News Corp. enormous control over some of the web's top properties, but it's not clear that Yahoo shareholders would go for such a deal. That's because it would likely torpedo all the gains Yahoo shares have enjoyed since the Microsoft bid was made public. And unless there's been a significant change of heart from his company's recent earnings conference call, this is Rupert Murdoch's most recent public comments on the topic, courtesy of reader Matthew Alvarez who just sent them to me: ""We are definitely not going to make a bid for Yahoo! We're not really interested at this stage,"" Murdoch said. Sources I have spoken to say you can't blame Yahoo for trying to shop around for a better deal. It's just that an asset swap is likely not what weary investors were hoping to see. If you had $45 billion sitting on the table, or an asset swap that might or might not work out eventually, which would you rather see happen. Message to Yahoo: Bird in the hand. Questions?

633,2008-07-23T08:43:53-0400,"News Corp'sPresident and COO Peter Chernin took the hot seat, talking about competition and the 'MySpace effect."" Fortune's media correspondent Richard Siklos interviewed Chernin in front of attendees of the Fortune Brainstorm:Tech Conference. In an event crammed with Chernin's competition-- other media and tech execs -- Chernin says the competitive set is ""much less relevant."" There's so much competition, infinite possibilities, Chernin says he thinks of News Corp's biggest competitor as itself and its own limitations. There's been a ton of buzz about Facebook here at Brainstorm:Tech, so MySpace is a natural topic. News Corp bought MySpace for a steal, a mere $580 million, making News Corp seem quite forward thinking (Facbook's value is some $15 billion based on a Microsoft investment). So Siklos asked ""Is there are MySpace effect"" -- i.e. is the acquisition changing the way the rest of the company does different? Chernin says MySpace helps push the company to focus on the consumer experience even more directly. Say, with Hulu, which News Corp is co-owns with NBC Universal. But what about monetization? MySpace may have the number one marketshare in social networking and millions upon millions of page views and users but it's still ten percent short of billion dollar target. It seems MySpace's challenge growing advertising is the same one other online sites face: there's infinite inventory, so it's tough to convince advertisers of a certain banner ad's value. Chernin's solution? Creating category scarcity, which is easiest to create with premium video, simply because there's less of it. He said the company's challenge is to convince advertisers that the eyeballs they should reach aren't on portals, but are on social networks, pointing out that the MySpace homepage gets more his than American Idol. It may be a while before advertisers look at a banner buy as a mass media opportunity like a Super Bowl ad but he has a point. Chernin is also bullish on mobile-- News Corp co-owns mobile video startup Jamba. But it sounds like Chernin thinks the real mobile potential hasn't been tapped yet. Media companies have been talking about mobile for years. At every one o these conferences I go to plus all the CES and National Association of Broadcaster type events it's always a hot topic. Maybe the new iPhones so many of the folks here are toting will push mobile distribution along. Questions?  Comments?  MediaMoney@cnbc.com"

635,2016-08-02T11:27:45-0400,"  As Microsoft released an updated Xbox gaming console Tuesday, the company's stock was up more than 20 percent from a year ago.   That's significantly better than the technology industry as a whole, including the other dividend-paying tech stocks like IBM, Cisco and HP, that have seen a boost this year as investors seek steady payments. That may be because analysts and investors finally see potential for tech veteran Microsoft to seize market share from its younger competitors, even if some of its products are still struggling.   A cornerstone of the company's budding turnaround is Windows 10, which was released last year and which fixed many of the problems that made Windows 8 and 8.1 unpopular. It may be the fastest-adopted operating systems in Microsoft history. According to data from Net Applications, Windows 10 has gained more market share in the first 12 months than the successful Windows 7 did after its 2009 release.    The rapid growth in Windows 10 adoption was due in part to the oldest trick in the book: giving it away for free (the promotion just ended). For the first year, anyone running Windows 7 or 8 could upgrade for no cost, attracting hundreds of millions of devices to the new platform. Among organizations that switched to the new version, 66 percent cited the free upgrade as a major reason, in a Spiceworks survey released in July.    The strategy didn't do much to help PC sales, but it did breathe new life into Bing, the company's much-ridiculed search engine. Bing comes as a central component in the latest OS, and some users report difficulty  switching to competing search options.    By the end of 2015, Bing had become profitable for the first time, with $1 billion in revenue. In the first fiscal quarter of 2016, search revenue was up by nearly 30 percent as the company experienced higher volume and higher revenue per search.    Almost 20 percent of search revenue in September was driven by the new OS, according to the company. Bing now has around 10 to 20 percent of the global search engine market, an uptick which coincides with the success of Windows 10. That's not bad for a product that had been compared to ""throwing money down a rat hole,"" but it remains to be seen whether it will remain profitable.    Analysts also have high hopes for Microsoft's Azure cloud services. Azure has more than 10 percent of the worldwide market for the cloud and has doubled its revenue from those services in the last year, according to a report by Synergy Research Group released Monday.    The cloud service has also gained high-profile clients recently, including Boeing's aviation analytics applications and NBC's streaming of the Summer Olympics in Rio. While all cloud services are behind Amazon's market share of more than 30 percent, Azure has been slowly gaining ground in the marketplace.   Cloud services were a major focus of the new strategy put in place by CEO Satya Nadella in 2014. Nadella declared that the company would be ""mobile-first"" and ""cloud-first,"" but the company seems to be seeing more success with the second goal than the first.   ""While Microsoft is seeing strong growth in its cloud and commercial service business, we remain concerned about the consumer-facing businesses, and particularly by the large hole in the company's product line left by the slow demise of the Windows phone,"" wrote Argus Research analyst Joseph Bonner after the July earnings call.    The question is whether the most promising Microsoft products can make up for ongoing failures like the company's mobile phones. Other efforts, like its acquisition of LinkedIn  and ""Project Scorpio"" — a planned high-resolution virtual reality console — are still big question marks.    Investors seem to be banking on the upsides of Microsoft's products, driving the stock close to the company's all-time high in late 1999.   Disclosure: CNBC parent NBCUniversal owns NBC Sports and NBC Olympics. NBC Olympics is the U.S. broadcast rights holder to all Summer and Winter Games through the year 2032. Correction: The results of the Spiceworks survey were released in July. An earlier version misstated the timing."
636,2012-11-02T04:59:00-0400,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Two weeks before trial in a high-stakes lawsuit pitting Google's Motorola Mobility unit against Microsoft, Google made what has become a common request for a tech company fighting for billions of dollars: a public court proceeding conducted largely in secret.Google, like its counterparts in the smartphone patent wars, is eager to keep sensitive business information under wraps -- in this case, the royalty deals that Motorola cuts with other companies on patented technology.Such royalty rates, though, are the central issue in this trial, which starts Nov. 13 in Seattle. U.S. District Judge James Robart has granted requests to block many pre-trial legal briefs from public view. Though he has warned he may get tougher on the issue, the nature of the case raises the possibility even his final decision might include redacted, or blacked-out, sections.Legal experts are increasingly troubled by the level of secrecy that has become commonplace in intellectual property cases where overburdened judges often pay scant attention to the issue.Widespread sealing of documents infringes on the basic American legal principle that court should be public, says law professor Dennis Crouch, and actually encourages companies to use a costly, tax-payer funded resource to resolve their disputes.``There are plenty of cases that have settled because one party didn't want their information public,'' said Crouch, an intellectual property professor at University of Missouri School of Law.Tech companies counter that they should not be forced to reveal private business information as the price for having their day in court. The law does permit confidential information to be kept from public view in some circumstances--though the companies must compellingly show the disclosure would be harmful. Google argues that revelations about licensing negotiations would give competitors ``additional leverage and bargaining power and would lead to an unfair advantage.''Robart has not yet ruled on Google's request, which includes not only keeping documents under seal but also clearing the courtroom during crucial testimony. It is also unclear whether he will redact any discussion of royalty rates in his final opinion. The judge, who will decide this part of the case without a jury, did not respond to requests for comment.NOT PAYING ATTENTIONApple Inc and Microsoft Corp have been litigating in courts around the world against Google Inc and partners like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , which use the Android operating system on their mobile devices.Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS smartphone software, and Microsoft holds patents that it contends cover a number of Android features. Google bought Motorola for $12.5 billion, partly to use its large portfolio of communications patents as a bargaining chip against its competitors.Robart will decide how big a royalty Motorola deserves from Microsoft for a license on some Motorola wireless and video patents.Apple, for its part, is set to square off against Motorola on Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, in a case that that involves many of the same issues.In Wisconsin, Apple and Motorola have filed the overwhelming majority of court documents entirely under seal. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb did not require them to seek advance permission to file them secretly, nor did she mandate that the companies make redacted copies available for the public.Judges have broad discretion in granting requests to seal documents. The legal standard for such requests can be high, but in cases where both sides want the proceedings to be secret, judges have little incentive to thoroughly review secrecy requests.In Apple's Northern California litigation against Samsung, both parties also sought to keep many documents under seal.

The yields rose as high as 3.26 percent on Oct. 9.Weve had issues getting through this 3.13 (percent) level and staying below it, mainly because I think it was a big breakout level in the market, said di Galoma.The Treasury Department will sell $31 billion in seven-year notes on Thursday, the final sale of $108 billion in coupon-bearing supply this week.A $39 billion sale of five-year notes on Wednesday saw the weakest demand since 2009 by direct bidders, which includes some foreign central banks.A $38 billion sale of two-year notes on Tuesday was marked by solid demand.This week's economic focus is Friday's reading of gross domestic product for the third quarter.

639,2012-11-02T10:59:00-0400,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Two weeks before trial in a high-stakes lawsuit pitting Google's Motorola Mobility unit against Microsoft, Google made what has become a common request for a tech company fighting for billions of dollars: a public court proceeding conducted largely in secret.Google, like its counterparts in the smartphone patent wars, is eager to keep sensitive business information under wraps -- in this case, the royalty deals that Motorola cuts with other companies on patented technology.Such royalty rates, though, are the central issue in this trial, which starts Nov. 13 in Seattle. U.S. District Judge James Robart has granted requests to block many pre-trial legal briefs from public view. Though he has warned he may get tougher on the issue, the nature of the case raises the possibility even his final decision might include redacted, or blacked-out, sections.Legal experts are increasingly troubled by the level of secrecy that has become commonplace in intellectual property cases where overburdened judges often pay scant attention to the issue.Widespread sealing of documents infringes on the basic American legal principle that court should be public, says law professor Dennis Crouch, and actually encourages companies to use a costly, tax-payer funded resource to resolve their disputes.``There are plenty of cases that have settled because one party didn't want their information public,'' said Crouch, an intellectual property professor at University of Missouri School of Law.Tech companies counter that they should not be forced to reveal private business information as the price for having their day in court. The law does permit confidential information to be kept from public view in some circumstances--though the companies must compellingly show the disclosure would be harmful. Google argues that revelations about licensing negotiations would give competitors ``additional leverage and bargaining power and would lead to an unfair advantage.''Robart has not yet ruled on Google's request, which includes not only keeping documents under seal but also clearing the courtroom during crucial testimony. It is also unclear whether he will redact any discussion of royalty rates in his final opinion. The judge, who will decide this part of the case without a jury, did not respond to requests for comment.NOT PAYING ATTENTIONApple Inc and Microsoft Corp have been litigating in courts around the world against Google Inc and partners like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , which use the Android operating system on their mobile devices.Apple contends that Android is basically a copy of its iOS smartphone software, and Microsoft holds patents that it contends cover a number of Android features. Google bought Motorola for $12.5 billion, partly to use its large portfolio of communications patents as a bargaining chip against its competitors.Robart will decide how big a royalty Motorola deserves from Microsoft for a license on some Motorola wireless and video patents.Apple, for its part, is set to square off against Motorola on Monday in Madison, Wisconsin, in a case that that involves many of the same issues.In Wisconsin, Apple and Motorola have filed the overwhelming majority of court documents entirely under seal. U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb did not require them to seek advance permission to file them secretly, nor did she mandate that the companies make redacted copies available for the public.Judges have broad discretion in granting requests to seal documents. The legal standard for such requests can be high, but in cases where both sides want the proceedings to be secret, judges have little incentive to thoroughly review secrecy requests.In Apple's Northern California litigation against Samsung, both parties also sought to keep many documents under seal. After Reuters intervened to challenge the requests, on grounds it wanted to report financial details, U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh ordered both companies to disclose a range of information that they considered secret -- including profit margins on individual products -- but not licensing deals.

640,2018-10-25T05:49:00-0400,"BEIJING, Oct 25 (Reuters) - China finds it ""hard to understand"" why the United States is not sending senior government officials to a major import expo in Shanghai next month, the foreign ministry said on Thursday.The world's two biggest economies are locked in an escalating tariff row, with President Donald Trump having railed against China for what he sees as intellectual property theft, entry barriers to U.S. business and a gaping U.S. trade deficit.Set to run from Nov. 5 to Nov. 10, the China International Import Expo will bring together thousands of foreign and Chinese companies, aiming to boost imports, allay foreign concern about China's trade practices and show readiness to narrow trade gaps.But the United States does not plan to send senior government officials to the fair, a U.S. embassy spokesman said on Wednesday, urging China to end what he called harmful and unfair trade practices.Speaking at a daily news briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that it was the right of the United States to send whoever they wanted, adding:""The United States, on the one hand, asks China to open its markets to U.S. products and services, yet on the other hand, the United States is not willing to send anyone to come when we open the door and invite people from all over.""""This way of speaking and acting, I think everyone will believe, as I do, is extremely contradictory and hard to understand,"" she said.The import fair shows that China is willing to open its doors to other countries and share the benefits of Chinese development, Hua added.More 130 countries and 2,800 companies have decided to take part, including 180 U.S. companies such as Microsoft Corp , Disney and Intel Corp, she said.""Many U.S. companies have said to China that they wish to make full use of this expo to increase cooperation between Chinese companies and regions and U.S. companies and regions and to create a more effective platform for this,"" Hua said.China has said British trade minister Liam Fox will attend, while diplomats say most major trading partners will send delegations, including some that have been critical of its trade practices, such as Australia, Canada, France and Germany.President Xi Jinping announced the import expo in early 2017 and is expected to speak at its opening.However, some critics have dismissed the event, which China plans to hold every year, as largely a propaganda effort.

Initial demand appeared solid, but customers were wary.Early reviews of the Surface tablet were mixed, with praise for its slick hardware, but concerns about battery life and limited software and applications available.``We've seen steady pre-order sales on Windows 8 devices from early adopters,'' said Merle McIntosh, senior vice president of product management at online electronics retailer Newegg. ``However, we expect that most average consumers are waiting until after launch to make a purchase decision.''Investors were uncertain about the prospects for success of Windows 8, but many feel a solid launch could help Microsoft's stock, which has languished between $20 and $30 for much of the last decade.Apple's shares have significantly outperformed Microsoft's over the past 10 years, and its market value is now more than double Microsoft's. Microsoft was little changed at $27.87; Apple fell 0.7 percent at $612.73.``This really is about debunking the notion that Microsoft is a dinosaur and they are relevant in a new climate of tablets and mobile,'' said Todd Lowenstein, portfolio manager at HighMark Capital Management, which holds Microsoft shares.``Extreme pessimism and almost utter failure is priced into the shares, so any kind of positive delivery on units, customer perception, would be really beneficial to the stock.''"
643,2016-07-20T16:29:12-0400,"  Microsoft surged on Wednesday after beating earnings estimates, but one strategist says that the hype will be short-lived.   The tech giant's stock rallied 5.3 percent to reach a three-month high during Wednesday trading. But Boris Schlossberg, managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, says that a ""short-term Microsoft story"" is in the works that will see the company unable to maintain its momentum.   ""You are never going to be buying Microsoft products unless you absolutely have to,"" he said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch.""  ""Ultimately, I think that's a negative thing for the stock, even though of course they did well with the cloud. So I'm not really a big believer into this big move today.""   In fact, Microsoft's total second-quarter revenue only reached $20.6 billion compared with $22.2 billion from the same quarter last year. While the company's cloud services saw a 7 percent increase in revenue, phone sales declined as the Windows Phone failed to gain traction. Even Microsoft's gaming division is in a slump as Xbox One sales disappointed, though the company is releasing the Xbox One S in August to compete against Sony's top-selling PlayStation 4.   However, not everyone believes that Microsoft could see a downtrend soon. Dennis Davitt, chief investment officer at Harvest Volatility Management, believes that Microsoft has become a strong stock.   ""The other story about this is this is a stock that's now a yield stock,"" he pointed out. ""So we see it similar to Coca-Cola, Philip Morris, Procter &amp; Gamble. Those stocks all have a 3 percent dividend yield. Microsoft now pays a 2.5 percent dividend and it trades roughly at a 26 P/E.""   ""It's been around, it has good cash flow, so you see people investing in those stocks, and I think there is growth there,"" he added.   Microsoft closed on Wednesday at $55.91, just slightly under its intraday high of $56.76. "
644,2016-07-20T18:12:56-0400,"  As stock valuations rise each day, Jim Cramer says investors need to figure out what they can handle in the market. He compared Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft to explain the concept of risk and reward amid elevated prices.   ""As we go higher and higher, the risks grow and you need to know not just the rewards but what can go wrong after this historic run,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.   Cramer chose these three stocks because they are well-known, and provide insight on the different ways that stocks can be valued in an overheated market.   The cheapest of the three is Microsoft, which reported a very strong quarter on Tuesday. It is transforming itself from a software company focused on PCs to be a large provider of cloud. With a growth rate of approximately 7 percent and the stock selling at 19 times earnings, Cramer noted that it is actually cheaper than the average stock in the S&amp;P 500 right now.   ""In an era where there are precious few ways to get decent income, Microsoft, after this incredible quarter, represents a very strong opportunity,"" Cramer said.  The reason why it's still so cheap? Because of its history, Cramer said. For a long time the company was perceived as a boring one with a product that was becoming outdated. Its previous CEO Steve Ballmer made a series of bad bets, including when the company purchased Nokia's phone business for $7.2 billion. Cramer thinks it was ""one of the most boneheaded acquisitions in history."" ""They would have done better if they just set that cash on fire, like the spoils from the Armenian money-train heist,"" Cramer said of Microsoft's decision.  Facebook hit an all-time high on Wednesday when it confirmed that its messenger service now has 1 billion users, with 200 million new users since the beginning of the year.   The stock seemed expensive to Cramer at 31 times earnings, but he thinks the growth rate is actually accelerating, even with a 31 percent monster growth rate. That actually makes it cheap in Cramer's perspective, because growth stocks tend to trade between one or two times their growth rates and Facebook is at the bottom of the range.   ""I pronounce Facebook as being relatively inexpensive versus a ton of other growth stocks in this market, suitable for those individuals willing to take on some risk in order to get a lot more reward than stock like Microsoft can offer,"" Cramer said.   Then there was Amazon, which doesn't even seem to trade on earnings. Even if Cramer could compute the valuation, he estimated that it trades at 117 times next year's earnings estimates. This one is so difficult because Amazon doesn't play by the rules, he said.    Cramer can easily justify paying $56 for Microsoft or $122 for Facebook. But Amazon? That one could be a different animal from them all, thus Cramer warned it is only for investors who are willing to take on a serious amount of risk.   ""You really have to believe that it will do the same thing to every other retail category that it has already done to books and electronics and apparel. You have to believe Amazon will destroy the mall,"" Cramer said.   Amazon could be a leap of faith, but Cramer advised that a lot more things have to go right for the stock to keep climbing, even if history suggests that will happen.   Questions for Cramer?

645,2016-07-20T18:44:07-0400,"  Microsoft may have blown away Wall Street's earnings predictions, but it has another key challenge ahead, market watchers told CNBC's ""Squawk Alley"" on Wednesday.    ""LinkedIn is absolutely critical—they have to nail this,"" said Brent Thill, managing director at UBS. ""This is their biggest deal they've ever done. It's three times larger than the last acquisition.""   Microsoft offered to buy LinkedIn in June for $26.2 billion—a huge deal after a mixed track record of buys for the company, Thill said. Microsoft's past failures may leave investors skeptical of the LinkedIn deal, but Thill said he thinks CEO Satya Nadella knows what it takes to preserve the culture of LinkedIn.    Now LinkedIn has opened up the pathway to human resources for Microsoft, Thill said. There could be some opportunity for acquisitions, Thill said.    Thill's comments come as Wall Street digests Microsoft's latest earnings report, when it posted fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of 69 cents. Revenue came in at $22.64 billion, as its key cloud product, Azure, saw revenue grow 102 percent. Shares of the software company bounced 5 percent on Wednesday, as the results alleviated some concerns about whether cloud could offset the company's transitioning server business, said Walter Price, managing director, senior analyst, and portfolio manager on the AllianzGI technology team.  Price said he thinks Microsoft is a solid no. 2 in the cloud space, while Thill said Microsoft is a close second, behind Salesforce.com, when it comes to financials and customer relationship management.    ""They're moving to the cloud, and they're growing really rapidly,"" Price said. ""That's impressive."" Disclosure: Microsoft is an investment banking client of UBS.  "
646,2016-07-19T20:41:33-0400,"  Wall Street analysts are feeling better about Microsoft's stock following the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings results, which showed it was making progress in two key areas that investors care about: Intelligent Cloud and Office 365.   Microsoft stock traded up as much as 4.25 percent to $55.34 in after-hours trading on Tuesday after the company easily topped analysts' expectations.   ""People were uncertain and maybe a little nervous going into this print, based on what happened last quarter,"" Scott Kessler, an analyst at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, said. ""There was nothing to really suggest that things would change so significantly.""Commercial revenue from Office 365 grew 54 percent (59 percent in constant currency) in the quarter, and cloud-computing plaform Azure had revenue growth of 102 percent (108 percent in constant currency), the company said.  ""This past year was a pivotal one in both our transformation and in our partnership with customers who are also driving their own digital transformation,"" chief executive officer Satya Nadella said on a conference call with analysts.   Nadella said that Microsoft was focused on the new workloads and growth that came from its cloud offerings, which do more than the company's servers did. Microsoft sets itself apart from rival Amazon Web Services by having better support for developers and options to customize applications around Azure, he said. There are now more than 27,000 applications across Office 365 and Dynamics 365. Microsoft's application stores will be a new way for developers to reach consumers, he said.  Nadella also highlighted the big name customers using Office 365,   including Facebook, Hershey's and Discovery. Azure was also drawing high-profile customers, including General Electric, Boeing, SAP and Citrix, thanks to its international footprint, security and support, he said.   ""Companies looking to digitally transform need a trusted cloud,"" said Nadella.   ""Every conversation with have with customers is cloud-led,"" executive vice president and chief financial officer Amy Hood added. ""What we're talking about now is really pivoting your business for the long term. I'm sure there are cases where that has lengthened the sales cycle, for good reason.""  Hood said she felt good about Microsoft's cloud momentum and expected material improvement in the fiscal year 2017 thanks to investments and partnership deals. Commercial cloud gross margins would improve over time, Hood said. At the same time, as Microsoft's cloud continued to build momentum, she said she expected the company's tax rate to increase.   On competition with AWS — the public cloud leader — Hood had this comment for investors, ""I think I have a strong line of sight to AWS's margin profile.""   Despite the positive comments from the company, some analysts remained cautions.   ""We expect these results will help investors feel better about top-line trends at Microsoft,"" Citi analyst Walter Pritchard said in a note to investors. ""However, an uncharacteristic increase in expenses points to better revenue having to come at a trade-off of lower profitability."" "
647,2016-07-19T13:51:12-0400,"  Microsoft is set to report earnings today after-the-bell.   With shares up 14% over the past year, should you get in ahead of earnings? The ""Halftime Report"" experts discuss.Kevin O'Leary, Stephanie Link, and Sarat Sethi own Microsoft "
648,2016-07-18T17:06:33-0400," Microsoft's quarterly sales are expected to fall short of last year's — marking the fifth consecutive year-over-year decline — when the company reports earnings after the close of trading Tuesday.    Wall Street analysts on average expect the tech giant to post fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $22.14 billion on earnings per share of 58 cents, according to a Thomson Reuters survey of 23 analyst estimates. This would mark the smallest year-over-year drop in quarterly revenue since the fourth quarter of last year.    Overall, revenue is expected to decline 2 percent for fiscal 2016, but the company is headed in the right direction: Revenue growth is expected to return next quarter. Analysts project Microsoft to report 2 percent growth in the September quarter and 4 percent growth for fiscal 2017.   Perhaps, then, the worst is behind Microsoft.    One bright spot is certainly the company's cloud business — up 120 percent last quarter — as more companies migrate to the cloud and Microsoft closes the gap with market leader Amazon Web Services. (Microsoft recently announced a high-profile new partnership with General Electric.)    Azure is emerging as a public cloud winner, said Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss, who has an overweight rating on the stock and a $64 price target.   Microsoft is proving that it can successfully leverage existing relationships to offer customers a combination of on-premise and cloud products, a unique advantage over cloud rivals AWS and, Alphabet's Google Compute, said Stifel analyst Brad Reback in a note to investors Thursday. Reback has a buy rating on the stock and a $58 price target. He expects Azure to have grown 95 percent year over year to a $630 million business. Though Office 365 — the subscription to access Office applications and services in the cloud — offers lower margins than Microsoft's declining software licensing business, it is reaching an inflection point, said Reback. It now has more than 22 million subscribing customers and recurring subscription revenue should continue compensating for lost license revenue.   ""Microsoft continues to make steady progress with its cloud transition and expect Office 365 and Azure will be healthy contributors to the top and bottom line for the next several years,"" he said. Office growth is expected to turn positive and accelerate starting in fiscal 2017, with subscription growth finally offsetting licensing declines, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan in a note to investors on Tuesday.  As the Nokia saga draws to a close, Wall Street is breathing a sigh of relief.   Microsoft is in the process of restructuring its money-losing phone business, cutting up to 1,850 jobs and limiting its phone business to a few Windows 10 and Lumia devices. By shuttering most of its hardware activities, Microsoft will save between $500 million and $800 million, said Reback. (MacMillan put potential savings even higher, at $950 million.)    Though it is too soon for Microsoft's $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn — expected to close later this year — to impact earnings, analysts will be listening for commentary regarding the rationale behind the deal, timing and integration on the earnings call.   ""We believe there are a number of angles for Microsoft to drive growth,"" said Reback. LinkedIn is expected to begin to contribute to Microsoft's business starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, said MacMillan who is ""cautiously positive"" on the deal. The company's growth profile already looks ""very attractive,"" he said. Excluding currency fluctuations, Microsoft has grown earnings per share by 14 percent so far this fiscal year.  ""This is unrivaled at mega-cap peers,"" said MacMillan. ""We think Microsoft deserves a premium, especially given our conviction on earnings growth sustainability."" He has an outperform rating on the stock and a $61 price target."

650,2016-07-11T11:48:31-0400,"  The CEOs of two of the largest U.S companies — Microsoft and GE — pushed back strongly against a political tide that threatens to weaken America's ties to the global economy. Monday on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took aim at U.S. trade policies that would prevent the country from remaining a ""beacon of progress"" on the world stage.""Right now what I'm looking for is the politics in our country to get to a place where people can win elections by making a case for both globalization and addressing the inequities that do exist in our society,"" Nadella said.  ""That's where we need to get to. It can't be one versus the other,"" he said.     Nadella spoke along with General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt from the Microsoft's Worldwide Partner Conference in Toronto on Monday, an annual gathering ""with the goal of increasing partner profitability and accelerating business growth."" Immelt said that national policies promoting 2 percent GDP growth, for instance, aren't enough for U.S. companies.    It comes as presidential candidates like Donald Trump have called for more protectionist trade policies, like tariffs on Chinese goods, renegotiating NAFTA and restructuring NATO. Democrat Hillary Clinton has also shown mixed support for some trade deals.    ""We can compete,"" Immelt said. ""I understand that there's people that haven't done as well as others have as we've globalized. But the fact is that this country is quite competitive. We have great people that work in our factories. We have great products. I would love to see more policies that would help us compete globally versus closing the door on globalization.""    Microsoft and General Electric on Monday announced a deal to make GE's industrial software platform available on Microsoft's cloud, a move that puts Microsoft one step closer to its cloud computing rival Amazon. The deal also bolsters GE's software ambitions.    ""The way we've always thought about partnerships is, 'What are the companies that are innovating in software? Building solutions that we can partner [with] as a platform provider?'""Nadella said. ""In the past it was mostly about tech companies. But now every company is a tech company.""     Immelt that GE supports policies like an export-import bank, and if there isn't one in the U.S., they'll move production around the world and take advantage of export banks elsewhere.    ""Everybody looks at these trade deals and things like that to be for Microsoft and GE or big companies like that,"" Immelt said. ""We've already globalized. We have 400 factories around the world. Microsoft is in every country around the world. These trade deals help small companies, not big companies.""   — CNBC's Jon Fortt contributed to this report.  "
651,2016-07-11T15:02:58-0400," Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said he's happy that Pokemon Go was successful for Nintendo — because it will be good for him, too.    ""This Pokemon interest will hopefully will translate into a lot of interest in HoloLens,"" Nadella said Monday on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""   HoloLens, Microsoft's augmented reality play, takes the form of a headset. That's different than Nintedo's Pokemon Go, which has exploded in popularity by using mobile phones to let users interact with virtual cartoon characters in the ""real world.""       That huge mobile phone audience helped send Nintendo shares up 24.5 percent in the Japanese trading session Monday.    Still, Nadella doesn't think that Microsoft missed the chance to have the next Pokemon — rather, he sees enterprise applications of augmented reality headsets taking off in the next two years, as people can use augmented reality hands-free for things like education and training.     ""I think it's fantastic to see these augmented reality applications getting built, because the best thing that can happen when you're creating a new category is for applications that are these killer apps, whether it be game or in the industrial scenario, to get invested in,"" Nadella said.    Even General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt said that by helping field engineers fix machinery better the first time, augmented reality could be worth $50 billion to industrial companies like GE.    ""I'm not a great gamer, so I can't really say how much that's worth — but the industrial applications of this are going to be billions of dollars of productivity,"" Immelt said.    He sees uses from refineries, to jet engines, to utility plants, he said.   ""If you get sick of your iPhone you just throw it away and get another one. You don't do that with a jet engine or a gas turbine,"" Immelt said. ""So our ability to deliver ... more productivity tools is like gold for our customers.""  "

But it's an important step for Microsoft, which wants to establish itself as the favored partner for big business.It won't be easy. Amazon is still the leader in renting cloud computing resources over the internet, a practice commonly called ""infrastructure as a service."" There's also nothing in the GE deal that steers customers away from running GE's industrial platform in Amazon or Oracle's clouds. Microsoft will now be available as a third option.Still, Microsoft hopes that when GE's Predix becomes available on Azure next year, its longtime industrial customers will be more likely to adopt Azure. Microsoft also intends to make its other cloud offerings, including Office365, Dynamics and Cortana, work well with Predix.Monday's announcement puts a spotlight on GE's software ambitions. The industrial giant projects $6 billion in digital revenue in 2016 and has targeted $15 billion by 2020. At the center of that effort: GE's Predix. It aims to securely link industrial equipment to the internet, to both boost its performance and lower its operating costs. "

Turner, 51, plans to start the Citadel job in September, according to a person familiar with the matter. Having spent 10 years at Microsoft, including overseeing the sales and marketing of Office 365, he is well-versed in managing a large global team and launching technology platforms for wide distribution.   Turner will join Citadel as chief executive officer of the company's securities business, which is centered on a multifaceted trading platform that handles orders for everything from stocks to interest rate swaps. He will also be a vice chairman of the firm.   A one-time cashier at Wal-Mart, Turner was named a corporate officer there at age 29, the retailer's youngest ever at the time. He later became CEO of Wal-Mart's Sam's Club division.   In a statement released Thursday morning, Turner said he was excited to lead an ""exemplary team"" at Citadel ""as we grow this global business."" He also thanked Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and his colleagues there for their leadership and friendship.   Citadel Securities is a huge player in market making. The firm often processes more than a billion equity shares per day in its securities unit; on its website, the company boasts that its share of the U.S. retail investor market is 35 percent.   It also has made a major push into new markets of late. Over the past year, Citadel has begun trading U.S. Treasury bonds, interest rate swaps and custom-designed swaps. Earlier this year, it bought the market-making arm of KCG Holdings on the NYSE floor, giving it the single-biggest footprint of any trader there."
655,2016-07-07T18:26:55-0400," LinkedIn Chairman Reid Hoffman says that Microsoft is a natural partner for the business network he co-founded. The $26 billion sale to the tech giant is the best way to generate value for shareholders, customers and employees, he told CNBC on Thursday.    For LinkedIn, whose shares were down 40 percent in 2016 before the deal was announced, it was simply too hard to compete with the public tech giants like Microsoft, Facebook and Google. Hoffman said it's easier for private companies to compete.  ""Once you get into a public company, if you're not throwing a lot of ability to do R&amp;D, and to progress your technology at a very fast rate, then it's difficult to compete with [the tech giants],"" he said. ""I think start-ups compete with them, I think private companies compete with them. I think the question is, as a public company you're held to, 'OK, what is your quarterly earnings? How does that growth look like?'""   Hoffman said that companies like LinkedIn need to be investing in technology over a five-year time horizon. But then it makes it hard to get into the same league as the tech giants. ""I think it's possible we could have done it,"" at LinkedIn, Hoffman said. ""But it also is risky.""   LinkedIn and Microsoft first explored the idea of partnerships and product integration before settling on a full sale. Hoffman said a full integration was the best solution to bring value to customers.     ""To reach a lot more people and to grow much more strongly, especially internationally, Microsoft brings all that,"" he said. ""From Microsoft's perspective, we bring a network of individuals that tend to bring productivity to corporations. ... Those two things together make great benefit for the individuals and the corporations, and that reflects into kind of a good economic value.""  Hoffman said he's already impressed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's suggestions of how LinkedIn can be integrated into Microsoft's tools, while the company continues to operate independently. The two companies, Hoffman said, have missions that are ""naturally aligned."" "

657,2016-07-02T03:43:16-0400,"  A bidding war with Salesforce.com forced Microsoft to pay nearly $6 billion extra to seal its planned takeover of LinkedIn last month, according to new details released on Friday.   The contest eventually led Salesforce to offer $500 million more than Microsoft, at least on paper, though its cash-and-stock offer was heavily dependent on its own share price, in contrast to the all-cash bid from the software company.   A month-long back-and-forth between the two rivals pushed the value of the all-cash deal to $26bn, making it the third-largest acquisition in the tech industry.   Details of the frenzied bidding were revealed in a regulatory filing that LinkedIn made with the Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of a shareholder vote to approve the deal.   The high price that Microsoft ended up paying could now lead to deeper cost-cutting at LinkedIn after the deal is completed. Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella warned Jeff Weiner, his counterpart at LinkedIn, during the bidding that ""a discussion of cost synergies in the transaction would be necessary"" as Microsoft pushed its offer higher.   The seeds of Microsoft's giant bid were sown on 16 February, only 12 days after the professional networking site shocked Wall Street with a disappointing earnings report that wiped more than 50 per cent off its stock price. The idea of an acquisition was raised in a meeting between Mr Weiner and Mr Nadella, according to the report, though it did not disclose who broached the idea.  It was only a month later, after two other, unnamed companies approached LinkedIn about possible bids, that Reid Hoffman, the company's chairman and controlling shareholder, went back to Mr Nadella to ask if he was interested in making an offer.   Four companies in all expressed potential interest in an acquisition though two dropped out before bidding began, according to the filing. It did not identify Salesforce by name, but Marc Benioff, the company's CEO, has said that he was involved in the bidding for LinkedIn.  More from the Financial Times  Millennial investors warn wealth managers to go digital When the outside world intrudes on Silicon Valley  Airbnb sues San Francisco in fines dispute  Microsoft's opening ""indication of interest"" envisaged a price of $160 a share in cash. It later won the right to exclusive negotiations with LinkedIn after lifting its offer to $182, making it look like a deal was close.   However, a 10 per cent jump in Salesforce's share price during a 12-day period in mid-May boosted the value of its rival offer and forced a renewed round of negotiations. Microsoft finally clinched a deal with an offer of $196 a share, compared to the notional $200 a share value of the Salesforce cash-and-stock offer.   The bidding war boosted the premium that Microsoft paid for LinkedIn from 22 per cent to 50 per cent, eventually making up for the losses seen since the company's February stock price collapse.

658,2018-12-06T15:41:00-0500,"SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc, the biggest supplier of chips for mobile phones, on Thursday pushed further into the PC market with a line of chips designed to power business machines.Qualcomm's ""Snapdragon"" processor chips historically have been at the heart of mobile phones like Alphabet Inc's Google Pixel phone and many Samsung Electronics Co Ltd devices.Over the past year, though, Qualcomm adapted its chips to operate PCs running Microsoft Corp's Windows operating system, making those machines start up more quickly and stay connected to the Internet constantly, much like a mobile phone or tablet.But the chips Qualcomm used in those early PCs were essentially modified versions of the chips it sold for mobile phones. At an event in Hawaii on Thursday, Qualcomm officials said they have created a new series of chips called the Snapdragon 8cx that will be dedicated to PCs.The biggest difference is the new Qualcomm chips will support Windows 10 Enterprise, the version of Microsoft's popular operating system that is sold to businesses. Previous Qualcomm chips supported only the consumer versions of Windows, making business customers less likely to purchase computers powered by them.Qualcomm's move puts it in greater competition with chipmaker Intel Corp, which last year still derived more than half of its $62.8 billion in revenue from PC chips and dominates that market. Intel's association with Windows PCs was so strong that the computer industry referred to them as ""Wintel"" machines for decades.Qualcomm and others are also challenging Intel's supremacy in the data center business. Qualcomm's chips are powered by technology from SoftBank Group Corp-controlled Arm Holdings. Several companies - including Amazon.com's cloud division Amazon Web Services, a major Intel customer - are working to make ARM-based chips suitable for data centers.

659,2016-06-29T17:54:49-0400,"  Humans have a lot to contribute even in the face of artificial intelligence, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Wednesday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch.""    ""I definitely fall into the camp of thinking of AI as augmenting human capability and capacity,"" Nadella said. ""And then distilling a set of principles. Algorithmically, for example, how can AI be programmed to care for humans — not have bias built in? How can it be trustworthy? How can it be transparent? Those are the principles of AI design that are pretty core.""  Earlier this year, of course, Microsoft made headlines when one of its chat bots apparently became racist and sexist after a barrage of offensive Twitter comments. As machines get more intelligent in very narrow ways, technology has a role in amplifying empathy, curiosity and creativity, Nadella said.   Cortana, Microsoft's answer to Apple's Siri, is already become more intelligent every day, Nadella said, echoing his recent comments in Slate, where he argued that humans and machines will work together, not against each other.   ""With all the abundance we have of computers and computing, what is scarce is human attention and time,"" Nadella said. ""So having the personal digital assistant really helps me regain my time — empowers me to get more out of every moment of my life.""    Nadella spoke alongside Walter Isaacson, CEO of the Aspen Institute and author of ""Steve Jobs,"" at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado, where speakers covered broad topics like the role of machines in policy and the future of Mars. The interview coincided with the announcement of Nadella's new book, ""Hit Refresh,"" that will focus on the future of intelligent machines.    The meeting came amid a changing landscape for technology companies. Britain's vote to leave the European Union pressured stocks in the industry, just after Microsoft closed a monster acquisition of social network LinkedIn.    Microsoft's 30-year history in the U.K. means the company will continue to invest in its sizable business there, Nadella said. But Nadella said that technology companies need to make a better case for global trade creating local wealth.    ""What happens in Britain, what happens in the world, matters a lot to us in our core business,"" Nadella said. ""The real thing is, 'How do we bring back certainty that global companies and a global economy can thrive in a connected world?'""   Nadella said that Microsoft remains focused on organic innovation and what Microsoft can uniquely contribute to the world as a company. But the LinkedIn deal was ""game-changing"" because the two firms aligned so closely, he said.   ""LinkedIn was an amazing deal for us to do because of their mission,"" Nadella said. "
660,2018-12-24T09:15:14-0500,"Facebook, Elon Musk and the rise and fall of cryptocurrency dominated tech headlines in 2018.Microsoft, T-Mobile, Comcast, Disney and IBM all announced major acquisitions.Here's a look at the biggest tech and media stories from 2018, through tweets.Elon Musk, Facebook, cryptocurrencies and ""Fortnite"" helped define the year in technology in 2018.Here's a look back now at the year in technology media — in tweet form.It was less than 12 months ago when start-up Ripple was sitting on close to $80 billion of XRP, a cryptocurrency that trades publicly like bitcoin. Celebrities including Paris Hilton and Jamie Foxx were endorsing coin offerings.Since then, the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies has fallen by about 80 percent.This tweet from Ripple sums up the mood in January, when the buzz around crypto's surge had taken the tech world by storm.Ripple.Facebook didn't have the best year from a public relations standpoint. It got a lot worse as the year progressed. But the drumbeat had started by February, punctuated by actor Jim Carrey's tweet that he was selling his Facebook stock and deleting his page because of the company's dissemination of false information ahead of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.Carrey.In the land of video games, ""Fortnite"" owned 2018. It's still a bit unclear what the rise of the online video game means for the technology world. Will today's tweens and teens use video games as their primary methods of social contact, eschewing social networks? Will ""Fortnite"" become the bedrock game of choice for years to come, lifting the valuation of Epic Games even higher?We don't know yet, but it certainly made a star of Ninja, who told CNBC in March he made $500,000 a month playing the game in what is thought to be CNBC's most retweeted tweet ever.Ninja tweet.Mr. Zuckerberg goes to Washington.Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg answered questions from lawmakers about the company's use of a data, a problem that would linger throughout the year, after a series of investigative reports shed more light on its procedures.Tweet.And after years of flirting, T-Mobile and Sprint finally pulled the trigger and announced a merger, which could take the number of U.S. major wireless companies from four to three. It's still unknown if U.S. regulators will allow the deal, though it did gain approval from U.S. national security officials on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. last week. If a deal does go through, we'll miss T-Mobile CEO John Legere throwing shade at Sprint. He reminded us of that with this friendly announcement of the deal in April.Legere Tweet.Netflix announced that former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama entered into a multiyear agreement to produce content for Netflix, reinforcing the importance of original material to CEO Reed Hastings's strategy. Netflix actually topped Comcast and Disney in May in overall valuation for the first time ever, crowning the company as the world's most valuable media empire. That didn't last too long, as a sell-off of FAANG stocks later in 2018 pushed Netflix back down to earth — sort of. The company still has a valuation far higher than its media peers from a comparative multiple perspective.Netflix tweet.Microsoft made its big acquisition of 2018, acquiring GitHub for $7.5 billion. CNBC later reported how Microsoft outbid Google for the developer platform, cementing Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's reputation for being open to the outside developer community.

Would anyone have predicted that five years ago?Microsoft tweet.Tesla CEO Elon Musk had a big year on Twitter in 2018. His odd rant about British diver Vernon Unsworth, who helped rescue 12 boys trapped in a cave in Thailand, started chatter among onlookers that Musk might want to tone down the rhetoric as the CEO of a public company. Spoiler alert: That didn't happen.Musk would apologize later in July for calling the diver a ""pedo"" and a ""child rapist,"" claims he said ""were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths"" about Musk.Tweet.Musk shocked the world by announcing his intentions to take Tesla private for $420 a share with ""funding secured."" Who was funding the transaction? Tesla wouldn't say. It turned out the answer was no one. That's an SEC violation. Musk would eventually back down on the take-private thing and settle charges of fraud and market manipulation, agreeing to step down as chairman of Tesla and personally paying a $20 million fine. Musk's ill-advised tweet led to a significant market loss in Tesla shares, but shares have bounced back after Musk's settlement.Musk Tweet.Twitter made news of its own, permanently banning conservative commentator and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and his publication Infowars. The move followed similar decisions from YouTube, Apple and Facebook, which removed content from Jones, citing restrictions on hate speech and harassment. The reactions from tech's most influential companies marked a potential turning point for how they dealt with public discourse. Decisions on speech comes fraught with challenges, many of which will certainly extend into 2019 and beyond.Jones tweet.It's very unusual to have the fate of a $39 billion company come down to a public auction, but that's what happened when Comcast outbid Disney to acquire Sky in a three-round event, run by the U.K. takeover panel. The auction was a byproduct of a months-long bidding war between Comcast and Disney for the majority of 21st Century Fox, which had initially agreed to a deal with Disney last December. Comcast's higher offer for Fox in June eventually caused Disney to pay $20 billion more for the assets, but Disney ended up getting some of that money back when it agreed to sell its stake in Sky (part of the broader Fox deal) to Comcast.Tweet.IBM made the biggest tech acquisition news of the year, agreeing to buy Red Hat for $31 billion.

661,2018-12-17T18:00:00-0500,"Dec 17 (Reuters) - Growth of economic equality between the sexes appears to be stalling globally as proportionately fewer women join the workforce than men, and artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies are rife with gender gaps, according to a World Economic Forum report released on Monday.Women saw gains this year in some measures of economic parity, such as income, but declines in access to healthcare and education and political involvement, according to the report.""The overall picture is that gender equality has stalled,"" said Saadia Zahidi, head of social and economic agendas at the World Economic Forum (WEF). ""The future of our labor market may not be as equal as the trajectory we thought we were on.""Zahidi said participation of men in the workforce has increased more than women. This trend may be due to the impact of automation on jobs held by women and because women often are responsible for unpaid work including childcare, according to the report.Women are under-represented in growing areas of employment that require science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) skills and knowledge, the report finds.The WEF highlights that women represent only 22 percent of the workforce for artificial intelligence, a major driver of innovation focused on machine learning. As artificial intelligence grows, the divide between the sexes in the field may widen, according to the report.The analysis, which also uses data from professional networking firm LinkedIn, shows that women working in artificial intelligence are less likely than men to be in high-profile positions. They often work as data analysts or researchers, while men find employment as heads of engineering and information technology, according to the report.""It's going to be one of the roles growing in demand in the future,"" Zahidi said. ""Its a general purpose technology used across multiple sectors. Who's developing this technology matters.""The WEF calls for proactive measures to prevent the divide from growing in other industries that are applying artificial intelligence, including male-dominated fields such as manufacturing, hardware and networking.

Meanwhile, the Dow has fallen 6.7 percent in 2018 to mark its worst yearly performance since 2008.A key driver for Merck's outperformance was the strong ramp-up in sales of Keytruda, a drug used to treat various forms of cancer. Keytruda sales surged 150 percent and 89 percent in the first and second quarter, respectively. Sales of the drug also climbed 80 percent during the third quarter on a year-over-year basis.Vamil Divan, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said Merck and other pharmaceutical stocks also benefited from a ""rotation"" into defensive sectors like health care. ""We expect some of that rotation to continue, but also see our companies needing to deliver innovation in order to overcome pricing pressures and drive further upside,"" Divan, who has Merck pegged as a top pick, wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.Shares Pfizer, one of Merck's biggest competitors, were the second-best Dow performers this year with a gain of more than 18 percent, also benefiting from the rotation into more defensive names. Merck has a dividend yield of 2.9 percent, while Pfizer has a 3.3 percent payout.Microsoft, Nike and Visa rounded out the Dow's top five stocks as they all jumped at least 14 percent.These strong yearly performances were outweighed by steep losses in Goldman Sachs, IBM, DowDuPont, Caterpillar and 3M, however.Goldman Sachs was the worst-performing Dow stock of 2018, dropping about 36 percent. The stock has been under pressure this year as a scandal related to the defunct Malayan investment fund 1MDB lingers. Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded Goldman back in November, noting uncertainty over the scandal could fester.IBM, meanwhile, struggled this year as it continued its transition away from enterprise technology as its main source of revenue. Caterpillar and 3M were pressured by an ongoing trade war between China and the U.S. as a large portion of their profits comes from overseas.—CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."

665,2008-05-18T17:56:33-0400,"Microsoft Corp. is once again trying to team up with Yahoo Inc. to challenge Internet search and advertising leader Google Inc., although at this point the renewed talks haven't escalated to another attempt to take over Yahoo. The Redmond, Washington-based software maker disclosed the revived discussions Sunday without providing any specifics about the nature of the deal being explored except to say it involved bolstering the companies' position in the online search and advertising markets.""There of course can be no assurance that any transaction will result from these discussions,"" the statement said.In a statement late Sunday, Yahoo said its board is exploring several ""value maximizing"" alternatives and ""we remain open to pursuing any transaction which is in the best interest of our stockholders.""Microsoft emphasized that it hasn't resurrected a $47.5 (euro30.65) billion takeover bid that its chief executive, Steve Ballmer, withdrew May 3 after Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang — acting on behalf of Yahoo's board — demanded an additional $5.5 (euro3.55) billion.But Microsoft left open the possibility that it might dangle another buyout offer of Yahoo, depending on how the discussions progress between the two companies and their respective shareholders.Yahoo is facing intense pressure from its shareholders to reopen sales negotiations, with activist investor Carl Icahn threatening to replace the Sunnyvale, California-based company's entire board unless a deal can be worked out before Yahoo's July 3 annual meeting.Although Microsoft hasn't been in touch with Icahn yet, the software maker reached out to Yahoo after the billionaire revealed his plans Thursday to lead a shareholder mutiny, according to two people familiar with the current status of the discussions. These people requested anonymity because they aren't authorized to speak on behalf of the companies.Microsoft's latest talks with Yahoo could be aimed at providing an alternative to a search advertising partnership that Yahoo has been exploring with Google as part of its attempts to remain independent.Last month, Yahoo completed a two-week test that allowed Google to use its superior technology to sell ads alongside a sliver of Yahoo's search results. Since then, the two rivals have been mulling a long-term alliance that would likely raise antitrust concerns because the two companies combined control more than 80 percent of the U.S. search advertising market.While Google's help probably would provide Yahoo with a short-term lift, it might hurt Yahoo in the long run by making Google even stronger, according to some analysts.Ballmer already has said Microsoft will be less interested in Yahoo if it cedes control of search advertising to Google. Icahn has urged Yahoo's board not to enter into any deals, such as a Google partnership, that might diminish the company's value to Microsoft.Nevertheless, some analysts believe a formal partnership between Google and Yahoo could happen any day.The mere acknowledgment that Microsoft and Yahoo are at least talking again will likely cause more investors to conclude it's only a matter of time before the two sides work out an amicable deal.The theory that Microsoft would eventually renew its takeover attempt helped cushion the blow to Yahoo's stock since Ballmer withdrew an oral offer of $47.5 (euro30.65) billion, or $33 (euro21.29) per share, after Yang held out for $53 (euro34.20) billion, or $37 (euro23.87) per share.Yahoo shares ended last week at $27.66, down by just $1, or 3 percent, since Ballmer walked away from the discussions. They were trading at $19.18 when Microsoft announced its initial bid of $31 per share Feb. 1.Despite the intensifying pressure from Icahn and some of Yahoo's major shareholders, Yang and Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock reiterated last week that they won't sell the company for less than the board believes it's worth.While Yahoo's board has set a $37 (euro23.87)-per-share target, many analysts believe Microsoft could probably seal a deal by offering $34 (euro21.94) or $35 (euro22.58) per share.Most analysts believe Microsoft needs to make a dramatic move, such as buying Yahoo, to slow Google's rapid rise as the Internet reshapes the way people interact with computers. The shift is weakening Microsoft's core franchise of providing software tethered to the individual hard drives of personal computers.""We continue to maintain our view that there is no other company that needs Yahoo as much as Microsoft and Microsoft does not have compelling plan-B without Yahoo,"" Collins Stewart analyst Sandeep Aggarwal wrote in a research note last week.Although it still ranks as technology's richest company, Microsoft's Internet expansion efforts have been largely ineffectual. Since the end of the company's fiscal 2005, Microsoft's online operations have lost $1.5 (euro.97) billion.""The fact is that we are not where we want to be in this business yet and we've been in this position longer than we'd all like,"" Kevin Johnson, the head of Microsoft's online division, wrote in a Sunday e-mail to employees. Even if Microsoft can't work out a deal with Yahoo, Johnson assured ""we will be accelerating elements of our core strategy, and breaking ground in new areas.""Microsoft's latest advances in Internet advertising and search will be outlined in a conference this week, Johnson said.Once the Internet's kingpin, Yahoo was overtaken by the more nimble and innovative Google several years ago. With Yahoo's profits shrinking and revenue growth decelerating, Yahoo lost about half its market value — more than $25 (euro16.13) billion — in the two-year period leading up to Microsoft's initial bid.Yang, a Yahoo founder who became CEO 11 months ago, maintains the company is on the cusp of a turnaround that will boost net revenue by at least 25 percent in 2009 and 2010. That would be a dramatic improvement from the company's recent net revenue gains of about 12 percent.Microsoft first broached the possibility of forming a business alliance with Yahoo in late 2006, according to a letter that Ballmer released in February. In early 2007, Microsoft offered to buy Yahoo for about $40 (euro25.81) per share, according to a person familiar with those discussions. The person didn't want to be identified because that bid was never publicly disclosed."

The Redmond Wash. software maker didn’t provide details on the transaction being discussed.Microsoft on May 3 withdrew a bid for Yahoo that it made earlier in the year. Since Microsoft’s withdrawal, activist investor Carl Icahn has tried to push Yahoo into a deal with Microsoft by proposing an alternative slate of Yahoo directors and had bought 10 million shares and options to purchase 49 million more.The statement said that Microsoft is “not proposing to make a new bid to acquire all of Yahoo” but said that it “reserves the right to reconsider that alternative depending on future developments and discussions that may take place with Yahoo! or discussions with shareholders of Yahoo! or Microsoft or with other third parties, according to the WSJ report.

667,2019-01-05T11:09:15-0500,"Cybercriminals can now use a type of phishing to get around two-factor authentication, typically a code sent your cellphone that is needed to log in, according to cybersecurity firm KnowBe4.KnowBe4 used LinkedIn for its demo, but said many other websites are also vulnerable.The code for the attack is now public, according to KnowBe4.In a quest to make online accounts safer, many services now offer two-factor authentication. The system typically sends a code to a user's mobile phone that they need log in, along with a username and password.Cybersecurity professionals have advised enabling two-factor to add an extra layer of security — but according to at least one expert, this may not be a silver-bullet. Kevin Mitnick, who was once the FBI's most wanted hacker and now helps companies defend themselves, found that two factor authentication can be vulnerable.""Just by enabling two-factor authentication, you can't relax…a smart attacker could get access to your account,"" Mitnick said in an interview with CNBC. He is the chief hacking officer at KnowBe4, a cybersecurity company that trains people to spot phishing, or spoofed emails.Mitnick told CNBC he found out about the vulnerability when it was posted online for anyone to find.""The tool to actually pull these attacks off has been made public. So any 13-year-old could download the tool and actually carry out these attacks,"" he said.According to Mitnick, the attack begins when a cybercriminal sends an email that looks real, and asks the receiver to click on a link.Once the user clicks on the link, they are directed to log into the real website, including entering the code sent to their cellphone. Secretly, however, the log in went through the hacker's server and they were able to get the session cookie, the expert explained.""If we can steal the user session cookie, we could become them, and we don't need their username, their password, or their two-factor,"" Mitnick said.Mitnick showed CNBC that he was able to enter that code into his browser. ""When I hit refresh I'm going to be magically logged into the victims account,"" he said.Mitnick used LinkedIn to demo the attack for CNBC, but said many other websites are also vulnerable. The email he clicked on looked like a real LinkedIn connection request — but actually came from a fake domain, lnked.com. He said most people may not realize the difference.""It's not LinkedIn that's vulnerable. It's the actual user… It's a security flaw with the human,"" Mitnick said.In a statement, Mary-Katharine Juric, a LinkedIn spokesperson, told CNBC that the professional network took Mitnick's demonstration ""very seriously,"" and that LinkedIn has ""a number of technical measures in place to protect our members from fraudulent activity including phishing scams.""She added: ""When we detect this type of activity, we work to quickly remove it and prevent future re-occurrences. We strongly encourage members to report any messages or postings they believe are scams, and utilize our member help center as a resource to educate and protect themselves from frauds online.""This attack is part of what is known as social engineering, when hackers take advantage of human behavior to get you to do something, like click on a link. Another way to protect yourself is to pay close attention to email you get, even if you use two-factor authentication.""Social engineering if you do it right can be used to get into almost anything,"" said Stu Sjouwerman, KnowBe4'S CEO.To protect from attacks like this one, some companies are making tools called security keys.Instead of sending a code to your cell phone, security keys — which look like a keychain — contain a hardware chip, and use Bluetooth or USB to be the additional factor needed to log into your account. Recently, Google released its own version of the device, which it calls the Titan Security Key.""The security key stores its own password and requires the site to prove it's legit before releasing the password and getting you signed in,"" said Mark Risher, Google's director of product management for security and privacy.""It's not ubiquitous by a long shot but we are encouraged to see more and more sites and apps,"" he added."
668,2016-06-16T12:00:26-0400,"Call it a sign of the (high) times. After the legalization of medical or recreational marijuana in more than 20 states, Microsoft on Thursday will announce its first-ever partnership with a software company that supports the burgeoning cannabis industry. The collaboration involves Kind Financial, a Los Angeles-based start-up company that makes technology and tools for marijuana-related businesses to navigate the myriad rules and regulations in states across the country that allow the sale of marijuana. Kind sells what it calls ""Agrisoft Seed to Sale software,"" that lets growers track their plants from planting to the point of sale, and it provides kiosks that cannabis businesses use for cash management inside their stores.   It's the first time Microsoft has done a marijuana industry-related partnership, a Microsoft official told CNBC on Thursday. But the company's founder, at least, is not unaware of the issue. Bill Gates told BuzzFeed in a 2014 interview that he voted ""yes"" on the legalization of marijuana in his home state of Washington. ""It's an experiment, and it's probably good to have a couple states try it out to see before you make that national policy,"" he said at the time.    Now that experiment has turned into a business opportunity for the software behemoth. According to Kind, the deal announced Thursday involves Kind participating in Microsoft's newly created Microsoft health and human services pod for managed service providers. That means Kind's products will be available to customers using Microsoft's Azure government cloud product.    In a press release set to go out Thursday, Kimberly Nelson, Microsoft's executive director of state and local government solutions, said, ""Kind's strategic industry positioning, experienced team and top-notch-technology running in the Microsoft Azure Government cloud, made for an easy decision to align efforts.""    Kind's CEO, David Dinenberg, said ""No one can predict the future of cannabis legalization, however, it is clear that legalized cannabis will always be subject to strict oversight and regulations similar to alcohol and tobacco; and, Kind is proud to offer governments and regulatory agencies the tools and technology to monitor cannabis compliance."" "
669,2008-05-07T14:34:26-0400,"On Monday, the first day of our on-air coverage following the collapse of the Microsoft/Yahoo negotiations, we were rife with speculation about what, if anything, Microsoft might do next.We talked about every possibility: News Corp. and Microsoft blending their online businesses with Microsoft relying heavily on the MySpace property; Microsoft joining forces with Time Warner's AOL about some kind of partnership; Microsoft increasing its stake in Facebook or buying the company outright. Now there's word that, wait for it; wait for it, Microsoft's bankers have ""been in touch"" with Facebook, or ""contacted"" Facebook, or thought about Facebook, or logged on to Facebook, and the wires are going crazy with what may or may not happen next. I suppose it would be newsier if Microsoft decided NOT to contact Facebook. The story is on the Wall Street Journal's web site. It indicates that there are ""no active discussions"" between the two, that Microsoft put out ""subtle"" signals to Facebook to see if the company would be interested in a complete buy-out--which would build on the tiny equity investment Microsoft made in Facebook last year. That $240 million stake in Facebook ascribed a $15 billion value to the social networking powerhouse. But with no active discussions, and no comment from reps at either company, is there a ""there"" here? Nah. Or at least not yet. Microsoft is sniffing around for an internet strategy, and while publicly, Microsoft executives--including Bill Gates himself--say they want to grow the company's online business organically, it stands to reason that Microsoft wants to talk to lots of potential partners. As for me, I'm just working the phones trying to nail down who's returning those Microsoft calls; and what a potential deal with someone might really look like. Talk is cheap. As we learned from Yahoo , the news gets interesting when the offer is put in writing. Questions?  Comments?  TechCheck@cnbc.com"
670,2016-06-14T05:38:33-0400,"  With its colossal acquisition of LinkedIn this morning, Microsoft gets an immediate, powerful asset for its software sales pitch: A social dataset of 400 million-plus users.   That should fray nerves at Google, and raise pressure on it to respond with an acquisition of its own, one aimed at expanding its reach with business customers. It had already informally sounded out some mid-market business-focused cloud apps for acquisition earlier this year.   Over the past year, the search giant has directed considerable attention and resources to building out a sizable enterprise operation, an attempt to diversify its business (an ads one). One of the two pillars of the operation, apps for businesses, competes head-on with Microsoft.   And now Microsoft has a pool of valuable data — based on personal and professional information — that Google, despite its expensive past efforts, does not.   Google will have to answer — particularly since one product Microsoft said LinkedIn will assist with is Cortana, its artificial intelligence-powered personal assistant. AI is a linchpin feature that Google is using with its enterprise software sales pitch. Google's AI is widely considered best in the industry; but with LinkedIn's data, Microsoft could have a critical edge in its offering that trumps Google. If it wants to catch up, Google's not short on the cash. Nor is it short on will. Diane Greene, its enterprise SVP, who wields considerable power in the company, has an edict to grow her unit, even through acquisition, as Recode reported earlier.  Should Greene and Google go on a spree, here are some potential big targets:  Slack: The fast-growing workplace messaging app boasts three million users every day, and about a third of them use it from accounts paid for by their employers. While generally known as a popular tool at young tech and media companies, it's on track to launch an enterprise version that delivers the scale necessary for use in larger companies sometime this year. It's also working on enhancing the service with AI features that would give the Slack application the brains to anticipate a user's day-to-day business needs, boosting its appeal in an area Google already considers a priority.   And valued at less than $4 billion as of its most recent funding round, Slack is affordable. One important complication: Slack runs entirely on Amazon Web Services. Migrating it to Google's cloud service would be a big job.  Box: The cloud storage, sharing and collaboration platform was the darling of Silicon Valley ahead of its IPO last year. It's a different company today, with a fully imagined long-term strategy to help specific industries build custom applications and to act as the central cog connecting numerous existing business apps including Microsoft's Office, Salesforce.com, and, by the way, Google Apps. Its customers include household names like the Campbell Soup company, industrial giant GE and The Gap, and 10,000-seat deals with large customers are not uncommon.  Box's low share price, down 52 percent since its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, also creates an opportunity. Dropbox: What Dropbox lacks in a fully articulated vision for doing business with large companies, it makes up for with the scale of its numbers: More than half a billion people use Dropbox, plus 150,000 businesses. Its bread-and-butter business is file storage, sharing and syncing across multiple devices. And it works.   It recently moved its data off of Amazon's cloud and onto one of its own making. Privately held, its mutual fund investors have in recent months written down the value of their shares, suggesting it's worth about $10 billion. That may make it too big a bite even for Google, though parent company Alphabet has just over $75 billion in combined cash on hand.   —By Mark Bergen and Arik Hesseldahl, Recode.net.  CNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement. "
671,2016-06-15T10:16:58-0400,"  With Microsoft set to make the largest acquisition in its history, many are asking what is it about LinkedIn that made it worth the $26.2 billion? That's a hefty price tag, considering LinkedIn had 2015 revenue of $3 billion and a net loss of $166 million.In my opinion, the marriage of the leading professional social network and the world's largest software company demonstrates that we are decidedly at the start of a new era in software, where proprietary data is king, and will start to come bundled together with software. Moreover, I think we can expect that enterprise software will start to look and behave more like consumer internet services. It will be based upon the ability to harness behavioral data across the large sample of user inputs available in the cloud, and deliver useful and meaningful insight in a way that's never been done before. Taking a look back, it's safe to say that software has functioned relatively the same for the last 40 years. It's been a place for users to input information for tracking and reporting, and analysis — if any — was limited to one company's user base. Larger relevance or context of this data as part of a larger network of users has been lacking.Microsoft is about to bring the software industry forward, as it infuses relevance across its range of Office apps and cloud offerings. It will embed ""living"" profiles drawn from the proprietary professional information of close to half a billion people.  Next, Microsoft and their many rivals will battle for the more granular behavioral activities of users and customers in order to better serve them (and of course earn ever higher margins for this ""data-infused"" software.)  This is where ""machine learning"" will take center stage.  As each of our detailed actions is captured in software, analyzed along with hundreds of thousands of others, and provided back to users in the form of recommended next steps, software will no longer be a place to input data, but a place to go for specifically-tailored advice. We've seen this rise in the consumer realm, where technology companies are fundamentally aggregating and analyzing user behavior, and providing value back to users (and, of course,   advertisers.) For example, with wearable tracking devices like FitBit and others, users are able to receive actionable insight about their health and physical performance. Services like Facebook and Amazon are analyzing user flow and behavior to make the product easier to engage with — often in ways that we don't even notice.  There are countless other examples that also demonstrate that consumer technology puts behavioral and user data front and center, in a way that I expect we will start to see from the enterprise as the divide between these two segments starts to collapse.  Microsoft's latest move shows that we are already heading in that direction.Some may say that we've been hearing the promise of machine learning and data-driven insights for a decade now, and yet we are waiting to see the real results when it comes to the promise of software. There are two reasons why I believe that we really are on the brink of a massive disruption in technology.  First, Google has proven that server technology now has the ability to scale horizontally and bring unfathomable number-crunching power to each of us. Add this power to the structural change in software over the last 15 years, where Salesforce.com led software into the cloud.  Now, data across millions of end users is easily aggregated and analyzed. Taken together, this demonstrates that proven machine learning algorithms have both the horsepower and access to granular datasets that are unprecedented. It was never an issue about machines learning, it was whether machines could ingest and process enough data. Now they can.The technology world will be watching to see how the Microsoft integration plays out for users. Regardless of its success, the lessons here are plenty.  Software without an added layer of data and insights will soon become obsolete.  Commentary by Gordon Ritter, a founder and general partner at Emergence Capital.

672,2008-04-28T10:48:26-0400,"An overwhelming majority of Wall Street analysts see Microsoft preparing shortly to launch a hostile bid at its current price of $31 per share in cash and stock, a Reuters poll found.Most Wall Street analysts believe Microsoft now faces a drawn-out proxy campaign to win its unsolicited takeover of Yahoo, according to the poll.By contrast, the general view in February when Microsoft announced its offer was that Yahoo would agree to a friendly merger if Microsoft only sweetened its bid. By mid-March a Reuters poll showed that Wall Street expected Microsoft to buy Yahoo without raising its price.Microsoft last week repeated Chief Executive Steve Ballmer's 3-week-old threat that his company will go hostile, or even call off its bid, if Yahoo did not agree to a deal before this weekend. Microsoft executives said they will reveal their next move this week.""I'm betting that Ballmer is bluffing with his 'walk away' comments and that he's going hostile,"" said Jefferies &amp; Co analyst Youssef Squali, who believes Microsoft will stick with its current $31-per-share offer.Nineteen brokerages now say they expect Microsoft in coming days to move forward with a hostile bid after being frustrated in a three-month effort to entice Yahoo to reach a negotiated deal, the survey reveals.By contrast, only three brokerages see the possibility that the two sides will end their standoff over price and begin negotiations to reach a deal at a slightly higher price than the initial offer, which had been worth $31 per share in cash and stock, or $44.6 billion.Due to a drop in Microsoft stock, it is now worth $42.7 billion.Another three Wall Street houses see Microsoft walking away rather than raising its offer. Many Microsoft shareholders fear a higher-priced deal would dilute the value of their shares and have an uncertain payback.""There are times when the best deals are those that aren't done,"" Dinosaur Research analyst David Garrity wrote in a research note to investors Friday. Nonetheless, he expects Microsoft to begin a proxy battle to unseat Yahoo's board.Were Microsoft to walk away, Garrity estimates Yahoo's stock could drop around 14 percent to $23 a share, while Microsoft's stock might jump about 17 percent to $35 a share.The two companies are in a standoff over price. Yahoo has said last week it remained open to a Microsoft merger, but the current offer ""substantially undervalues"" the company and it continues to explore alternative deals.Fourteen brokerages say they expect Microsoft to begin a campaign to unseat Yahoo's board and encourage the company's shareholders to accept its current $31 bid. Another five brokerages expect Microsoft going hostile at a lower price.To counter Microsoft, Yahoo has held talks with Time Warner  on a deal to merge Yahoo with Time Warner's AOL unit in return for Time Warner taking a stake in Yahoo, several sources familiar with the negotiations said earlier this month. A Yahoo-AOL tie-up would be part of a three-way deal in which Yahoo may partner with rival Google to use Google's advertising system to sell ads alongside Web search results Yahoo serves up to its users, these sources said.Yahoo executives told investors on a quarterly conference call last week it was ""premature"" to discuss whether a trial run of the Google ad partnership will lead to a deal between the two companies, but declined to comment on progress Yahoo is making on a deal with AOL or other alternatives to Microsoft.Long-Term, Deal Gets DoneDespite pessimism, the two sides can resolve their near-term disagreements, most analysts agree that, in the long run, Microsoft will find a way to get the deal done.""It's in neither Microsoft's nor Yahoo's interest for this bid to go hostile given that could increase the integration challenges over time so it's our hope that the two companies come to mutually agreeable terms,"" said Andy Miedler, an analyst with Edward Jones.He rates Microsoft stock as neutral, which means he expects its shares to perform in line with the broad market.Microsoft sees buying Yahoo as critical to compete with arch-rivalGoogle, which dominates the market for Web search and related advertising.Citi analysts Mark Mahaney and Brent Thill hold out for the idea that Microsoft must eventually raise its offer ""at a somewhat higher price"" than $31 a share to get a deal done.""Microsoft seems too committed to walk away.Yahoo's board would be hard-pressed to turn down a sweetened bid,"" Citi wrote in a research note Friday, entitled ""There Is NO Plan B."" Stanford Group analyst Clayton Moran says the heated rhetoric coming from both camps represents negotiating tactics aimed at getting the other side to blink, then come to terms.But in a research note published late last week, he argued Microsoft has other options instead of buying Yahoo, although each has its own set of trade-offs in terms of value to Microsoft and its ambitions to a bigger Web rival to Google.AOL's Internet media and advertising assets represent the closest thing to Yahoo and would significantly enhance Microsoft's Web audience, he said. Microsoft has reportedly talked with News Corp, owners of the MySpace social network, about a joint bid for Yahoo, but Moran believes MySpace is less promising than Facebook, albeit one that is unlikely to sell at a price Microsoft would be ready to pay.The Reuters poll drew responses from 17 Microsoft analysts and 15 Yahoo analysts from 25 different Wall Street brokerages. It was conducted on Friday, a day before Microsoft's 3-week-old deadline expired for Yahoo to reach a deal."
673,2016-06-14T11:23:34-0400,"Microsoft's $26.2 billion deal to acquire LinkedIn came at a time when the professional social network's users were valued at less than ever before. Before the deal's announcement Monday, the market's valuation of a unique visitor on LinkedIn was languishing around $165. That's the lowest price in the company's history for each unique visiting member — a metric comparable to the monthly active users reported by companies like Twitter and Facebook. The same is true for total registered members, another metric that records anyone who has ever made a LinkedIn profile. (CNBC calculated per user value by dividing the company's market value by the unique visiting members reported for each quarter.)LinkedIn suffered a vicious stock market rout of more than 40 percent in February after issuing weak guidance for the next year. Microsoft's offer propped up the stock with a 50 percent premium, placing the value of each of the company's 106 million visiting members at $247 each. That's a big boost, but still 10 percent lower than the company's average over its lifetime.   That premium places the network's users slightly above the per unique user valuation for Facebook, which had pulled ahead during the company's weak performance so far in 2016. Twitter's per user valuation has been dropping since its initial public offering at the end of 2013.     All three social networks have seen their user bases grow substantially over the last three years. Twitter's monthly counts are up 52 percent, Facebook is up 49 percent and LinkedIn has gained 63 percent in monthly users and nearly doubled in users overall.    The challenge facing all three companies is convincing investors that they'll be able to effectively monetize those massive groups of users. Facebook has soared to new highs this year by demonstrating that its ad network can wring real earnings out of its 1.7 billion monthly users.    In response to questions about whether the company was getting LinkedIn members at a bargain rate, a Microsoft spokesperson noted that the premium and revenue multiples the company is paying in the deal are well within the range of recent cloud software transactions. A LinkedIn representative declined to comment.    LinkedIn's business model differs significantly from the other two social network companies in that it not only makes money from ads but also charges membership fees for its premium product. Its biggest segment is talent solutions, which includes professional recruiting and job posting services.    Those additional revenue streams mean that each person added to the network is worth more than a user who provides revenue through advertising alone. It also means that for some users, simply signing up and filling out a profile has value even if that user doesn't sign in every month.    CNBC calculated the per user revenue rate by dividing the quarterly revenue for each company by the quarterly unique visiting members (for LinkedIn) or monthly active users (for Facebook and Twitter). While LinkedIn has always had the highest per user revenue rate, the company hasn't seen the sort of per user revenue growth that the other two networks have seen over the last three years.    Working with Microsoft could help LinkedIn find more uses for its unique user data and give it a chance to expand its user base at a more accelerated pace.   ""Mostly, the Street had lost confidence that LinkedIn would be able to significantly diversify its business,"" wrote Evan Wilson and Tyler Parker in a note for Pacific Crest Securities on Monday. ""A partnership with Microsoft gives us new hope."" "
674,2016-06-13T11:55:57-0400,"  Microsoft's history of acquisitions reveals a list of companies that were once hot but have since lost momentum. But investors think LinkedIn can escape the same fate.    Microsoft agreed to buy LinkedIn for about $26.2 billion in cash, as Microsoft seeks to accelerate the growth of Microsoft Office 365 and Dynamics, according to a statement released on Monday. Investors have high hopes for the new tie-up between Microsoft and LinkedIn, sending LinkedIn shares soaring 47 percent on the news of their merger.    The merger hopes to place Microsoft at the forefront of professional software services, to both enterprise customers and individuals. Now the pressure is on new Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella to show how this buy will differ from Microsoft's spotty portfolio of past purchases.   Perhaps most famous is Microsoft's $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia's mobile device unit in 2014. After managing to grab just 2.2 percent of the mobile market in 2015, according to IDC, Microsoft wrote off the entire purchase and drastically cut headcounts.    Although it was unsuccessful, Microsoft also aggressively pursued an acquisition of Yahoo for more than $45 billion.    It's hard to know what would have happened if that acquisition went through.But as Yahoo again hits the auction block, current bids are said to be around $5 billion, a steep decline from what Microsoft would have paid if it had gotten its way.    Nokia and Yahoo provide the most stark examples of shortcomings in Microsoft's past acquisition strategy. Indeed, the fact that Microsoft has never done well with large mergers is a con of the LinkedIn deal for UBS analyst Brent Thill, who warned in a research note of a potential ""culture clash"" between the younger LinkedIn and the more grown-up culture of Microsoft.  Microsoft also owns a slew of seemingly middling companies that apparently lost their hype under the enterprise technology giant's umbrella.    Microsoft's workplace social network Yammer, for instance, failed to retain the buzz of rival Slack, Google Search trends data shows.    Still, while a company like Skype (acquired for $8.5 billion in 2011) may not appear cutting edge compared to Apple's FaceTime, it still holds significant usership. Google trends data shows that worldwide, Skype and even Hotmail (which was rolled into Outlook in 2013) retain heavy search volume compared to FaceTime or Gmail, respectively.   While the LinkedIn acquisition is a bold move, IDC researcher Crawford Del Prete said it could be great for LinkedIn, and could drive new value to Office, Skype and Azure.    ""It's also a thriving, relevant platform at scale,""  Del Prete said. ""Nokia had lost scale in smartphones, Hotmail was not at scale in messaging (compared to the winners), and I believe Skype is a long term play that's working.""  — CNBC's Arjun Kharpal and Ari Levy contributed to this report.  "
675,2016-06-13T15:57:13-0400," Microsoft's $26.2 billion takeover deal for LinkedIn will finally allow the social platform to compete with other tech titans, LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner told CNBC on Monday.   ""It takes our scale to a completely different level,"" Weiner said on ""Squawk Alley"" hours after the announcement. ""The combination of our two companies, having Microsoft behind us, just enables us to realize the things we always dreamed of doing, and so we're excited about it.""   Moody's Investors Service placed Microsoft's ""AAA"" rating under review for downgrade following the deal announcement. Standard &amp; Poor's though, reaffirmed its ""AAA"" rating, and said it maintains all other ratings and a ""stable outlook"" on the company.The acquisition would allow LinkedIn to create a social fabric that can be ""seamlessly integrated"" with other areas of Microsoft, like Outlook calendar, he said. The companies started talking about a deal in February, after Weiner said he noticed a clear pattern among tech giants' earnings.    ""You look at Google, Apple, Microsoft and Facebook, and within the span of a few days after their earnings reports, collectively those companies increased their market capitalization within somewhere of $100 billion,"" Weiner said. ""It used to be that scale was hundreds of millions of users and billions of dollars of market cap. Today it's billions of users or customers and hundreds of billions of dollars of market cap.""    LinkedIn will fit into Microsoft's cloud by bolstering Office 365, helping connect the world's professionals and make them more productive, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said.   ""These professionals are using Office 365 on one side, and LinkedIn on the other side,"" Nadella told CNBC. ""That's one massive opportunity for us to increase engagement in both.""   Nadella pointed to a potential for Microsoft Outlook users to integrate LinkedIn information. The news feed on LinkedIn for example, might now include what projects someone is working on, and what their Outlook calendar looks like for the next two weeks.   ""Think about how you can bring AI to improve the relevance of that feed, that's what excited us and the mission,"" he said. ""It's about putting them together with the crown jewels of Microsoft, which is Office 365 and the cloud.""   The CEOs met a few years ago at a Microsoft CEO event but began shopping the deal in early 2016, Nadella said.     ""Jeff and I started talking in February about what's that next phase,"" Nadella said. ""Can we truly take today what is a fragmented work environment for professionals and complete the scenarios more tastefully with better relevance?""   Weiner will stay on as CEO of LinkedIn and will report to Nadella. The deal was unanimously approved by both companies' boards, and is expected to close by the end of the year. The acquisition is still subject to approval by LinkedIn shareholders and regulators.   LinkedIn will still operate as an individual entity, much in the way that Google's YouTube and Facebook's WhatsApp and Instagram were able to after their acquisitions by the two giants.    ""[They] have all gone on to extraordinary success and impact on a global basis following their acquisitions,"" Weiner said. ""It was that combination of alignment on sense of purpose and structure that we both got really excited about.""   Shares of LinkedIn surged 46 percent Monday to near $193, while Microsoft's stock was down 2.6 percent. Trading in Microsoft had been halted briefly for news pending before the announcement of the deal. "
676,2016-06-13T18:12:20-0400,"   Microsoft is ready to move the Xbox to the next generation.    The company on Monday unveiled a new Xbox One system — code named Project Scorpio — that retains many of the features of the current generation and will play all existing games, but greatly enhances the hardware power, enabling true 4K gaming and better support for virtual reality.  ""We believe it will be the most powerful console ever built,"" said Phil Spencer, head of Microsoft's Xbox division. ""This is hardware built specifically to lead the gaming industry into true 4K gaming. … We're announcing it today to give our developers and partners the ability to take advantage of the capabilities now in order to deliver ... more great games.""  Set to release during the holiday 2017 season, Scorpio will be fully compatible with all existing and future Xbox One titles.    Spencer may not have called Scorpio a ""next generation"" system, but analysts say that was only because of the changing nature of how video game consoles will work moving forward.    ""The traditional console cycle is dead,"" said P.J. McNealy, CEO and Founder, Digital World Research. ""Microsoft is now developing the Xbox in lockstep with Windows 10, which has been a longtime corporate goal.""   Project Scorpio shouldn't be confused with the Xbox One S, a new system that will come out this holiday. That revision of the Xbox One will offer a stronger graphical processing unit and smaller form factor, and will enable 4K streaming, but is still inferior to the few specs Microsoft unveiled about Scorpio.    The upcoming system will offer eight CPU cores and six teraflops of GPU power. Beyond 4K gaming with greatly enhanced graphics, it will allow Xbox to be fully in the running as virtual reality becomes a stronger force in the gaming world.    ""We're moving Fallout 4 to virtual reality,"" said Bethesda's Todd Howard. ""And to have a console that can support that, I think it's going to be magical.""   News of Microsoft's Project Scorpio comes just days after Sony confirmed the long-rumored more powerful PlayStation 4, code named ""Neo."" That system will similarly focus on 4K video output and offer more powerful internal components. Sony did not announce a launch date for its new system.    ""They're timing this pretty well with the rising tide of 4K TVs,"" says McNealy. ""The new [Xbox One S] enables 4K streaming but not true 4K gaming, but there really isn't true 4K gaming yet. But by holiday 2017, you'll see plenty of true 4K games, which should look spectacular."" "

678,2008-04-13T13:31:47-0400,"Yahoo Inc's attempt to form an alliance with Google Inc to stave off Microsoft Corp could run into more trouble with antitrust regulators than Microsoft's unwelcome takeover bid.While Yahoo is seeking a business partnership with Google -- unlike the outright merger that Microsoft wants -- legal experts say any deal between the world's two largest Internet search services will draw heavy scrutiny from U.S. and European competition regulators. ""The Justice Department would certainly want to take a serious look at that because it would mean that a firm that would want to take advertisements or to place advertisements (online) would have only one place to go,"" said Aaron Edlin, who teaches law and economics at the University of California at Berkeley. In recent years, Web search services have taken over from once popular portals or home pages, such as AOL, MSN or Yahoo's own home page, as the primary starting point for many consumers seeking information on the Internet. Google held a 59.2 percent share of the U.S. Web search market in February, compared with Yahoo's 21.6 percent and Microsoft's 9.6 percent, according to research firm comScore. To counter that dominance, Microsoft offered in January to buy Yahoo in a cash-and-stock deal now valued at $42 billion. Yahoo rejects that price as too low and has been casting around for other partners. It announced last week a test to outsource search advertising to Google, which sources say is part of Yahoo's plans to form a three-way alliance with Time WarnerInc's AOL to fend off Microsoft. Antitrust experts said regulators would likely oppose any permanent alliance between Google and Yahoo, while they would likely approve Microsoft's proposed merger with Yahoo. ""A Yahoo/Microsoft merger would primarily be designed to attack Google,"" said Thomas Hazlett, who teaches law and economics at George Mason University in Virginia. ""What you're seeing here is the sort of merger that has ... a plausible efficiency case."" FRAGMENTED MARKET While Google dominates search, Yahoo argues the market for online display ads -- the splashy banners or video ads that companies love -- is so fragmented that Yahoo is the biggest player with just 8 percent of the market. But the proposed cooperation between Google and Yahoo has already prompted congressional concern. The House Judiciary Committee announced it would take up the issues in upcoming hearings. Sen. Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat and chair of a Senate antitrust panel, said he was watching the Google test. ""Should there be moves to make this agreement permanent, we will examine it closely in the antitrust subcommittee to ensure that it does not harm competition,"" Kohl said in a statement. Kohl expressed concern about the rapid consolidation of formerly independent players in the Web advertising market. A year ago, Google agreed to buy DoubleClick in a $3.4 billion deal that closed only last month. Microsoft paid $6 billion for aQuantive, Yahoo bought BlueLithium for $300 million and Time Warner Inc's AOL unit bought Tacoda for an undisclosed amount. Gregory Sidak, founder of the economic consulting firm Criterion Economics, said U.S. regulators are likely to view the tech market as so dynamic and fast-changing that they will abstain from blocking any particular deal or joint venture in what appears to be an ultra-competitive industry. But European regulators are generally more likely to act to block mergers than their U.S. counterparts. ""Europe poses a larger antitrust risk for any of the (Yahoo) deals,"" Sidak said. In the absence of certainty, U.S. regulators tend to opt for less intervention rather than more. The Justice Department, in particular, has a reputation for approving deals that antitrust experts consider suspect, most recently the merger of the only two U.S. satellite radio companies XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc and Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. ""I think any company contemplating a merger or acquisition would want to get it through during the Bush administration,"" said Sidak, expressing a commonly held view in the legal community that, even if Republican nominee John McCain wins the 2008 election, there will be stricter controls. ""Even if McCain is elected, I think there's reason to believe they'll be some tightening of antitrust enforcement,"" he said. Evan Stewart of law firm Spaeder Zuckerman LLP predicted that, when the dust settled on the various deal scenarios, Yahoo would lose its fight to stay independent, a view widely shared among Wall Street investors betting on the outcome. There are ""very creative investment bankers providing Yahoo with all these very different end-games,"" he said. ""If you're hooked, eventually you're going to be dragged into the boat.""

679,2016-06-13T13:58:29-0400,"Satya Nadella may have abandoned his prudent approach. The Microsoft chief executive's $26 billion deal to buy LinkedIn  could reinvigorate the software giant's slipping grip on corporate computer systems and employee interactions. Paying a 50 percent premium for a flawed business raises several red flags, however.   The Windows operating system and Office software suite once gave Microsoft a chokehold over corporate computing. But the growth of the cloud and mobile devices has thrown the market wide open — first to alternative operating environments, and more recently to new collaborative software that threatens Microsoft's email, word processing and spreadsheet revenue. The company's efforts to move users to cloud versions of its programs may help, but its traditional dominance is under attack.  More from Breakingviews: Mass shootings erode U.S. soft power    Buying LinkedIn means Microsoft will control the best-known network where companies and employees – especially potential employees – interact. Making the LinkedIn bazaar operate smoothly with tools like Office, Skype, and other services run on Microsoft's Azure platform is the overarching vision. LinkedIn has problems, though. Less than a year ago, its stock was trading nearly 30 percent higher than the agreed offer price of $196 a share. A growth warning, the reputational damage of a massive security breach and the introduction of new features that provide revenue but annoy users have hurt the company. The board's decision to sell suggests the stand-alone outlook was not especially alluring.  Meanwhile, Microsoft's M&amp;A history raises questions, too. It has written down essentially the entire $9.5 billion it paid for Nokia. In 2012, it wrote off nearly all the $6.3 billion shelled out for digital-advertising agency aQuantive. Those deals were sealed by Nadella's predecessor Steve Ballmer, and it may be the current CEO will prove more attentive to integration. But the LinkedIn deal is the biggest Microsoft has ever attempted. Making such transactions pay off is tough, especially when the seller's adviser, Frank Quattrone's Qatalyst Partners, is known for scoring improbably high prices.   It's also hard to see past the press-release drivel. Nadella says the merger could boost growth as ""we seek to empower every person and organization on the planet."" As for LinkedIn, ""today is a re-founding moment"" according to co-founder and board member Reid Hoffman. Concrete indications of the deal's financial benefits are in worryingly short supply.

680,2016-06-13T20:53:15-0400,"Microsoft just announced its heftiest acquisition, the biggest-ever in the software industry and among the largest in the history of technology.None of those were good things, experts warned.""Big deals don't work,"" said Roger McNamee, a career tech investor, who co-founded private equity firms Silver Lake and Elevation Partners, in an interview Monday on CNBC. ""It's going to be hard to get the value out of this that I think they plan to get."" McNamee was referring to the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn, a deal three times the size of Microsoft's biggest previous acquisition —the $8.5 billion purchase of Skype in 2011. While Skype has worked out OK for Microsoft, at least from a usage perspective, the company's next-largest acquisitions have been total flops. The $6 billion purchase of aQuantive in 2007 and $7.2 billion acquisition of Nokia's handset business in 2014 both ended up as almost complete write-offs. Microsoft is far from alone in struggling to make tech mega-deals work.The $160 billion-plus AOL-Time Warner deal in 2001 quickly became synonymous with the internet bubble and its subsequent burst. Hewlett-Packard's disastrous $25 billion purchase of Compaq in 2002 was a major reason Carly Fiorina was pushed out as CEO three years later. The other giant tech deals were completed recently, so it's too early to declare success or failure; Dell's $67 billion purchase of EMC closed in the first quarter, as did Avago's $37 billion acquisition of Broadcom.Culture clashes, technology differences, a lack of product synergies and the need to please investors with excessive costs cuts are just some of the reasons mega-deals so often result in mega losses.In fact, the first question Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella fielded on Monday's conference call was about this very point:""You've had a tough track record in large M&amp;A,"" Brent Thill, an analyst at UBS, noted, asking, ""Why is this deal different?""Nadella gave a classic CEO non-answer. He said LinkedIn accelerated the company's move to the cloud and gave it a much larger network, adding technology and a customer base that enabled some ""transformative things that we can now do."" Nothing about history, though, or why it was different this time. The one obvious difference with the LinkedIn deal is that Nadella is now the one calling the shots, instead of his predecessor Steve Ballmer. Since taking over in early 2014, Nadella has led the purchase of only one billion-dollar company: the $2.5 billion purchase of Minecraft creator Mojang that September.But Nadella was reportedly trying to scoop up Salesforce.com last year for upwards of $50 billion, a deal that would have added the biggest developer of cloud-based software to a company that was rapidly moving from desktop to web and mobile. And let's not forget that Ballmer infamously tried and failed to buy Yahoo for close to $45 billion in 2008, back when the internet portal was still a force in online advertising.Unlike fellow tech giants Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon, Microsoft wasn't born on the web. Nadella, who led Microsoft's cloud division before taking the helm, has aggressively invested in the company's cloud infrastructure to compete with Amazon Web Services, as well as investing in Microsoft's Office 365 suite, which vies with Google's business apps. Nadella said that LinkedIn, while keeping its brand and CEO (Jeff Weiner), would integrate with Office 365 and Microsoft Dynamics, the company's customer relationship management product that rivals Salesforce. The data on more than 400 million professionals registered with LinkedIn and the customer base of recruiters will give Microsoft a business that's not only expected to grow 25 percent this year, but also could help Microsoft sell its core products more effectively.""You're going to see Microsoft emerge as a force to reckon with in sales force automation and compete with Salesforce head-on, as well as both grow and dominate the B2B marketing space,"" said David Yuan, a general partner at Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV), in an e-mailed statement.  TCV, which invests in public and private tech companies, snapped up shares of LinkedIn in the first quarter after the stock plunged more than 60 percent from its record high. Microsoft's purchase price marks a 50 percent premium over Friday's closing price and is about double the stock's low in February.Still, it was 29 percent below the stock's high of February 2015.  ""Microsoft's bid is also notable in that it shows large incumbents are opening up their wallets to snap up publicly traded assets that have traded down,"" TCV's Yuan said.   The all-cash transaction was expected to be largely financed with new debt, which Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said would be raised ""opportunistically during favorable market windows.""   Microsoft has over $105 billion in cash and equivalents on is balance sheet, contributing to a $394 billion stock market value.    The money is there for Microsoft to do this kind of big deal, but until Nadella can prove history wrong, skeptics won't have a lot of faith in the company's ability to make it work.Correction: The article has been updated to remove reference to Apple as a company born on the web.

At Computex today, Microsoft released a demo video of its vision of ""mixed reality"" where VR headsets can interact with the company's HoloLens, and more. Microsoft demonstrated a concept of its vision for a mixed world of HoloLens and VR headsets, which included a HTC Vive headset. While HTC is working with Microsoft on VR experiences with Windows 10, it's not clear if the company is planning to shift its software over to Windows Holographic.   More from The Verge:Android Wear without your phone: LG Watch Urbane 2nd Edition LTE reviewThe Game of Game of Thrones: millennials are proud to be total selloutsThis time-lapse video of the expandable habitat inflating on the ISS is awesome  Central to Microsoft's vision is allowing VR headset makers to make use of the software and OS that powers HoloLens. At present, most VR headsets can't mix real people and real environments into the virtual world in the same way that Microsoft's augmented reality HoloLens headset can. Microsoft is hoping VR headset makers will take advantage of Windows Holographic to enable its mixed reality capability. That makes Windows Holographic a new platform, and the key part is Microsoft's perception APIs that power a lot of the HoloLens experiences.   If a VR headset maker opts to use Windows Holographic then things like the Holographic shell (virtual Start menu), user interface, Windows Store, and Xbox Live services will all be available. Microsoft isn't sharing details on exactly how existing VR headsets could integrate Windows Holographic, but the company is working with Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, HTC, Acer, ASUS, Dell, Falcon Northwest, HP, Lenovo, MSI, and others on making Windows Holographic a platform for VR as well as AR.   It appears that no additional hardware will be required for VR headsets to run Windows Holographic, but Microsoft is planning to outline more software and hardware details at a WinHEC developer conference later this year. Microsoft's demonstration is merely a concept right now, but if the company can convince VR headset makers to switch to its operating system, software, and services then it has a key platform for distributing apps and VR content in the future.

683,2018-10-20T04:46:00-0400,"apps -source@ (Fixes wording in fourth paragraph)BRUSSELS/SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google will charge hardware firms up to $40 per device to use its apps under a new licensing system to replace one that the European Union this year deemed anti-competitive, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday.The new fee goes into effect on Oct. 29 for any new smartphone or tablet models launched in the European Economic Area and running Google's Android operating system, the company announced on Tuesday.The fee can be as low as $2.50 and rises depending on the country and device size, the person said. It is standard across manufacturers, with the majority likely to pay around $20, the person added.Companies can offset the charge, which applies to a suite of apps including the Google Play app store, Gmail and Google Maps, by placing Google's search and Chrome internet browser in a prominent position. Under that arrangement, Google would give the device maker a portion of ad revenue it generates through search and Chrome.Tech news outlet the Verge reported the pricing earlier on Friday, citing confidential documents.The European Commission in July found Google abused its market dominance in mobile software to essentially force Android partners to pre-install search and Chrome on their gadgets. It levied a record $5-billion fine, which Google has appealed, and threatened additional penalties unless the company ended its illegal practices.The new system should give Google's rivals such as Microsoft Corp more room to partner with hardware makers to become the default apps for search and browsing, analysts said.Qwant, a small French search company that has been critical of Google, said in a statement on Friday that it was ""satisfied that the European Commission's action pushed Google to finally give manufacturers the possibility to offer such choices to consumers.""

684,2016-05-27T06:49:29-0400,"  Goodbye ""123456,"" ""password"" and ""qwerty"": Microsoft has announced that it is going to ban weak and common passwords, a move that comes in the wake of a high-profile hack of user credentials at LinkedIn.  Microsoft said in a blog post this week that its Azure AD (its cloud based directory and identity management service) and Microsoft Account system had come up with the proposal to ""dynamically ban commonly used passwords.""    ""The most important thing to keep in mind when selecting a password is to choose one that is unique, and therefore hard to guess. We help you do this in the Microsoft Account and Azure AD system by dynamically banning commonly used passwords,"" Alex Simons, director of program management at Microsoft's Identity Division said in the post.   ""When it comes to big breach lists, cybercriminals and the Azure AD Identity Protection team have something in common – we both analyze the passwords that are being used most commonly. Bad guys use this data to inform their attacks – whether building a rainbow table or trying to brute force accounts by trying popular passwords against them. What we do with the data is prevent you from having a password anywhere near the current attack list, so those attacks won't work.""   The announcement referenced the news earlier this month that hackers were trying to sell 117 million user emails and passwords used for LinkedIn. The news, originally reported by Motherboard, signaled that a 2012 data breach was larger than initially thought and the tendency for users to create simple and common passwords was also highlighted by security experts.   Microsoft said in a recent 2015 ""Security Incident Report"" that its account protection systems prevent more than 10 million accounts from being attacked daily, showing the extent of hacking activity.   From that data, Simons said in his blog post that the company has collected ""a lot of data about which passwords are in play in those attacks"" and that the company uses that data ""to maintain a dynamically updated banned password list.""   ""We then use that list to prevent you from selecting a commonly used password or one that is similar,"" he said. The system was already at work in its account services – such as Outlook, OneDrive and Xbox, but would also be rolled out soon across the Azure AD system.

685,2016-05-26T14:16:14-0400,"  Tech giants Microsoft and Facebook are investing big in high-speed internet access by building a subsea cable connecting Virginia and Spain.    The MAREA cable will be the highest-capacity subsea cable to ever cross the Atlantic, and will lead to faster growth in internet bandwidth rates, the companies said. MAREA will run farther south than existing cables, expanding coverage, and works with a variety of equipment to make it cheaper and easier to upgrade.   Microsoft has increasingly shifted its offerings, like Office 365, Skype, Xbox Live and the Microsoft Azure, to the cloud. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, has committed to expanding web access with initiatives like internet.org.    Between them, they said, it made sense to create a ""vendor-agnostic"" partnership to create the cable. The MAREA collaboration comes on the tail of FASTER, a $300 million cable built by Alphabet, in partnership with five Asian telecom companies. FASTER is expected to come online sometime this year, according to Reuters' initial reports.   MAREA will begin construction in August and is expected to be completed in October 2017, according to the companies. It will be operated and managed by Telxius, Telefonica's new telecommunications infrastructure company, which hopes to ""capture market opportunities"" in Western Europe and new emerging routes in Northern Africa  as part of the deal.    We want to do more of these projects in this manner — allowing us to move fast with more collaboration,"" Najam Ahmad, vice president of network engineering at Facebook, said in a statement. ""We think this is how most subsea cable systems will be built in the future.""— Reuters contributed to this report. "

687,2016-05-18T06:12:34-0400,"  Microsoft is selling its feature phone assets to a subsidiary of Taiwanese firm Foxconn Technology and newly-established firm HMD Global for $350 million, the company announced on Wednesday, in a move that will see Nokia devices return to the market.   The deal will see Microsoft transfer all of its feature phone assets, including brands, software and services, customer contracts and supply agreements to Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile to HMD Global. Around 4,500 employees will also transfer over to or have the opportunity to join either company.    FIH Mobile Taiwanese firm will also acquire Microsoft Mobile Vietnam – the company's Hanoi-based manufacturing facility.    Microsoft will continue to develop its Windows 10 Mobile operating system and support its Lumia brand of phones and devices from partners such as Acer and Alcatel that run Windows phones.    The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2016 subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions, Microsoft said.    HMD Global is a recently-founded company headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, and run by former Nokia and Microsoft executive Arto Numella.    The company said on Wednesday it had signed a licensing agreement with Nokia Technologies – Nokia's licensing unit – that gives HMD the sole use of the Nokia brand on mobile phones and tablets worldwide for the next decade, as well as key cellular patents.    HMD also said that it has conditionally agreed to acquire the rights to use the Nokia trademark on feature phones from Microsoft until 2024 and the design rights relating to Microsoft's feature phone business.    All of these deals will make HMD the ""sole global licensee"" for all types of Nokia-branded mobile phones and tablets.    HMD also said it signed an agreement with FIH and Nokia Technologies to allow it full operational control over sales, marketing and distribution of Nokia-branded devices. HMD will also have access to FIH's manufacturing and engineering capabilities, mobile technology, and distribution network.    It's important to note that Nokia will not be manufacturing these devices but instead licensing its intellectual property, a move it said was on the cards when the time was right. Nokia will receive royalty payments from HMD for sales of Nokia-branded mobile products.    HMD said it will invest over $500 million over the next three years ""to support the global marketing of Nokia-branded mobile phones and tablets, funded via its investors and profits from the acquired feature phone business"".    ""We will be completely focused on creating a unified range of Nokia-branded mobile phones and tablets, which we know will resonate with consumers. Branding has become a critical differentiator in mobile phones, which is why our business model is centered on the unique asset of the Nokia brand, and our extensive experience in sales and marketing,"" Arto Nummela , CEO of HMD global, said in a press release.    The sale by Microsoft marks a further pullback from its mobile phone business, one of the struggling areas of the company, since it purchased Nokia's mobile device unit in 2014 for $7.2 billion. Windows Phone had just a 2.2 percent market share globally in 2015, according to IDC.    Microsoft has shifted its mobile strategy focusing on its flagship Lumia devices and business phone. But as a company, it has been pushing other areas such as cloud and the Windows 10 operating system. Last year, Microsoft wrote off its entire purchase of Nokia and announced 7,800 layoffs, mostly in the phone division. "
688,2016-07-20T07:41:34-0400,"Microsoft's earnings beat is a sign that technology stocks could be joining the market's outperformers, TradingAnalysis.com founder Todd Gordon said Wednesday.   If the tech sector is on the verge of turning, that would be a significant development for the overall market, according to Gordon, a CNBC contributor who trades on technical analysis.   Gordon said the breadth in the market has been strong, meaning the number of stocks moving higher is outnumbering those on the slide. That, he said, makes him want to remain bullish.  However, he noted technology has not participated in that trend in recent weeks. Apple and Netflix are ""lost,"" while Google and Amazon.com have been doing the heavy lifting for the sector, he said.  ""Everything is firing except technology. With Microsoft, we might now have technology joining the party here,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""  Gordon has a 2,500 target on the S&amp;P 500 over the next 12 months, though he said there is room for a pullback before then. The S&amp;P closed slightly lower at 2,163.78 on Tuesday, though the index is up about 3 percent for July on pace for its fifth-straight monthly gain.   Tuesday's trading saw some of the lowest volume of the year. Gordon said he believes volume is down as the market consolidates in the early innings of the earnings season and as geopolitical uncertainty lingers.   Still, Gordon said he is not reading too much into recent market developments due to the weak volume.   To be sure, technology's underperformance is not the only headwind blowing through markets, Gordon told CNBC. The dollar appears poised to resume its rally following Tuesday's weak reading on consumer confidence in Germany in the wake of Britain's vote to leave the European Union.   A stronger dollar makes it tougher for U.S. multinationals to sell products overseas.  — CNBC's Daniel Mescon and Chris Hayes contributed reporting to this story. "
689,2018-12-30T08:44:14-0500,"New York-based tech startup executives say they are looking forward to Amazon HQ2's move to the city because they believe it will bring an influx of tech workers along with it. But some warn an economic downturn could make it more difficult for smaller companies to compete.Amazon plans to bring 25,000 jobs to NYC when it builds its ""second headquarters"" in Long Island City in Queens.While many New Yorkers are dreading the day Amazon moves into its new ""headquarters"" in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens and crowds the subway with 25,000 new workers, there's one group of people welcoming the company with open arms: Executives at other tech firms.It may seem counter-intuitive that smaller tech companies are eager for a large potential rival to move onto their turf. But New York-based recruiters and tech leaders say they're using a different playbook from Amazon. They theorize Amazon's presence will bring in new tech talent that might not otherwise come to New York. That could mean those new workers will eventually move on to smaller tech companies or come up with ideas for startups on their own, spurring interest from venture capitalists in the area.According to interviews with 15 New York-based entrepreneurs, tech executives and venture capitalists, Amazon's move to NYC will lift up the local tech sector across the board, though some warn that it could also make it harder for smaller tech firms to compete for talent in the event of an economic downturn.""We play the long game when it comes to talent,"" said Melissa Enbar, VP of People and Culture at Birchbox, an online subscription service for beauty products.Enbar said people are attracted to smaller firms for different reasons than large ones, like the opportunity to have more exposure and responsibility early on. She said she expects Amazon's move will bring a wave of new talent to the city that a smaller company like Birchbox couldn't afford to relocate on its own.""Maybe their second job, like after they're done with Amazon, is Birchbox,"" Enbar said.Amazon's arrival in New York will certainly mark a significant moment for a city already considered to be the tech hub of the East Coast. Executives and investors said the move reinforces the city as an important place for tech and will help infuse it with venture capital and elite talent.But what's yet to be seen is how that talent and money will be distributed across the existing tech companies in the city in an already-tight labor market. While New York tech executives are hopeful that Amazon's presence will spread the prosperity around, it may only last as long as the economy remains stable, some warn.""In my experience in the past, when there's been recessions, there's always been a flight to safety from tech startups to larger companies that can provide more cash and more security,"" said Dan Finnigan, president and CEO of recruitment platform Jobvite. For Amazon, that means ""they could be timing it perfectly.""Still, Finnigan and other tech leaders said Amazon's move will be a net positive for the city's startups. At the very least, they said, it won't change much about the way they're already competing for tech talent.""To be honest, this is like the fifth time this has happened,"" said Dennis Crowley, co-founder and executive chairman of Foursquare. Facebook and Google both have major offices in New York, with Google planning to invest another $1 billion in its new Hudson Square campus, following a $2.4 billion purchase of shopping and office complex Chelsea Market earlier this year. Between the two investments, Google said it could double its New York workforce of 7,000 over the next 10 years.Amazon's impact in New York is largely dependent on the types of jobs it ends up bringing there. Warren Lee, an independent New York-based investor who most recently worked for Canaan Partners, said that Google and Facebook would likely remain the chief rivals for engineering and product talent if Amazon opts to establish less technical projects in New York. Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.On the other hand, Lee said, Amazon could pose a serious threat to AdTech companies in the city if it builds its advertising arm there, as many suspect was a key motivator to select the marketing mecca. In that case, AdTech companies would have to consider upping their pay and benefits to keep their niche talent, he said. Amazon said it will pay employees an average salary of $150,000 at its Long Island City office.Amazon's move to New York could shake up the perception that Silicon Valley is the only viable place to be for tech. But it's unlikely to overturn it altogether, entrepreneurs and investors said.When Google first built New York operation in 2000, ""it legitimized New York as a destination for engineering,"" said Howard Lerman, founder and CEO of New York-based cloud technology company Yext. ""The more companies that pick New York as a headquarters, the more likely [engineers are] going to end up staying on the East Coast.""That's a stark contrast from the sentiment around tech even a decade ago. When Eliot Horowitz began the database company MongoDB in 2007, ""People thought we were kind of crazy for building a pure tech company in New York,"" said Horowitz, now the chief technology officer.""We literally had VCs telling us we wouldn't invest unless you move to the Valley,"" said Mediaocean co-founder and CEO Bill Wise about his time at a previous company. Even now, he said ""I still have people who ask me, 'Oh can you really get good tech talent sitting in New York?'""But it's not all about showing up the West Coast.""New York would have a long way to go to dethrone San Francisco, but I don't think people in New York see it as a competition,"" said Eric Hippeau, managing partner at the New York-based venture capital firm Lerer Hippeau. ""It's not a zero-sum game as technology affects pretty much every sector.""Besides growing the talent pool for established companies, Hippeau said, Amazon's move to New York will likely sprout new entrepreneurs.""You'll find some people who go work for Amazon and Google and Microsoft and some of the other big tech companies and decide to use their skills to start businesses,"" Hippeau said.Foursquare and Flatiron Health are two successful New York startups founded by Google alums. Crowley, the Foursquare founder, and Nat Turner, co-founder and CEO of Flatiron Health, both joined Google by way of acquisition before leaving to start new ventures. Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche said in April it completed its acquisition of Flatiron Health for a value of $1.9 billion, ""on a fully diluted basis, subject to certain adjustments."" Foursquare declined to disclose its valuation for its latest $33 million funding round in October, but said it increased its valuation from 2016 which was reportedly around $325 million, according to the New York Times.Finnigan, the Jobvite CEO, said Amazon's move to New York will mark the beginning of a cycle of investment.""Amazon's presence will attract capital that will seek out the Amazon alumni,"" Finnigan said.Any initial fear startups had about Amazon's move to New York seems to have abated for now.""I'm looking at Amazon the same way I look at J.P. Morgan"" and others, said Lorna Hagen, chief people officer at human resources software company Namely.

690,2016-05-06T12:29:51-0400,"On a Tuesday in late March, Vungle CEO Zain Jaffer arrived disheveled and jetlagged to Microsoft's developer space in San Francisco. He'd been on an overnight flight from Beijing following an Asian trip for his online advertising start-up.Jaffer returned home early when the opportunity arose for a one-on-one meeting with a key figure at Microsoft: CEO Satya Nadella. He sprinted through the airport to make it downtown in time for an intimate event with a handful of Microsoft's top-tier partners ahead of the company's Build developer conference. Nadella was flanked by corporate vice president and chief evangelist Steve ""Guggs"" Guggenheimer. ""We were the smallest company there,"" said Jaffer, whose ad business forged a deal with Microsoft in November to make video promotions available in games on the new Windows 10 operating system. ""I was flattered to be in the room.""A start-up CEO would, of course, be foolish to turn down face time with the head of the world's biggest software maker, grabbing a slot that would otherwise likely fall to a top executive at Google, Facebook or Twitter. That Nadella is carving out time for companies like Vungle shows Microsoft's renewed effort to lure mobile developers and the CEO's refusal to concede defeat after years of underperformance.It's hard to think of Microsoft as an underdog. Fifteen years ago the software giant was so powerful and dominant that the U.S. government sought to break it up.But in mobile computing, the struggle is real, and Microsoft is an afterthought. Windows commands just 4 percent market share, way behind Google's Android at 62 percent and Apple's iOS at 28 percent, according to Net Market Share. Microsoft has grown its share slightly from 2.6 percent at the end of 2015.Improving MIcrosoft's image as a serious mobile player won't be easy. In July, just over a year after acquiring Nokia's handset business for $7.2 billion, marking a head-first dive head into mobile phones, Microsoft wrote off the entire purchase and announced 7,800 layoffs, mostly in the phone division.Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, who recently partnered with publisher Spil Games to develop mobile apps for iOS and Android said of Windows, ""They're such a small footprint on phones and tablets that we may do it later, but not initially.""Yet there's a quiet but growing group of Nadella fans that sees Windows 10 differently. The new and improved operating system, advocates say, is part of an evolving Microsoft, a company that two years into a management overhaul is embracing openness, simplifying development and encouraging innovation from outsiders.  Read MoreAtari founder joins forces with Spil Games for mobileCan Windows 10 mimic Microsoft's growing presence in cloud computing? In that market, its Azure infrastructure is going head-to-head with Amazon.com and rescuing Microsoft's once dominant server business from potential extinction.""This is a new regime,"" said Jason Hardi, CEO of Muzik, a wireless headphone start-up that's getting engineering and marketing resources from Microsoft to create high-tech consumer products that work with all devices. ""They recognize that they're not going to be the number one phone in your pocket, but they might be the second or they might be the tablet. And they're one of the leaders in gaming.""As an early-stage start-up, Hardi is impressed by the level of support Muzik gets from Microsoft, including a coveted speaker slot at Build. The two companies are also co-sponsoring hackathons like an event called MuzikHack that was held in Vancouver last month. Hardi said the session, designed to let developers build apps and services for his company's headphones, filled up five minutes after it was announced online.There are more anecdotes pointing to early success.Vungle, whose ad technology gives developers a new way to make money in their apps, is seeing growth of at least 25 percent a month across the Windows platform by linking brands with relevant games. Random Salad Games, the creator of casual titles like ""Simple Solitaire"" and ""Hearts Deluxe,"" has seen downloads triple since the launch of Windows 10.Meanwhile, Chinese developer Yodo1, the publisher of casual game ""Crossy Road,"" has been on Windows for a year, and the platform already accounts for 15 to 20 percent of the company's revenue. CEO Henry Fong said he expects Yodo1's Windows business to double over the next 12 months.""We're seeing Microsoft having a vision for universal gaming across multiple devices and making it really easy,"" Fong said.""I upload once, save once and distribute across multiple platforms.""That idea of universal development is central to Microsoft's grand plan. In order to take advantage of its full device suite — Xbox consoles, desktops, laptops, Surface tablets, mobile phones and even Hololens for augmented reality — cross-platform game development is essential. Build one version, let the device of choice figure out screen size and controls, and have the software automatically sync so that a user can stop playing on one device and pick up on another.The Universal Windows Platform, first introduced as part of Windows 10, was on full display at Build. In March, Microsoft made a move that was as symbolic as it was lucrative. The company shelled out about $500 million for Xamarin, whose software helps developers create apps across all major platforms. (Yes, that means iOS and Android.) Microsoft knows that if small teams working on tight budgets have to choose where to focus their efforts, most are going to follow the audience — and the money. Indie developers like Alain-Daniel Bourdages of GreenCod still need to see the results. With Android and iOS accounting for over 90 percent of the market, Windows has to show it can attract users and deliver returns to developers.""I don't want the market dominated by two players, so I wish the best for Microsoft,"" said Bourdages, whose company's casual games include ""Pinball Deluxe,"" ""Bad Traffic"" and ""Snood,"" and has struggled to make money on Windows. ""As a developer, I want to spend dollars where I get the most bang for the buck. It comes down to market share.""Numbers out of Microsoft suggest that business is on the upswing. The company said on Thursday that 300 million devices are now running Windows 10, thanks in large part to Microsoft providing free upgrades to users of older software, a promotion that will end in July. In its first eight months on the market, the growth of Windows 10 outpaced Windows 7 by 145 percent and Windows 8 by 375 percent over the same debut stretches, said Lisa Gurry, a Microsoft spokesperson.""You're seeing a new, hungry, open approach that's starting to pay off for us,"" Gurry said. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Vine have all updated their Windows 10 apps in the past week with enhancements over the previous versions. The bigger story Microsoft is selling is that it's not all about mobile market share. That's because games and apps are everywhere. In the fiscal third quarter, sales of Surface tablets increased 61 percent and Xbox Live monthly active users jumped 26 percent. By focusing on Windows, Random Salad Games has enjoyed being a big fish in a small pond. The company, started by a pair of Carnegie Mellon University computer science graduates, has been developing on Windows since 2010. Even with its huge growth on Windows 10, only 40 percent of revenue across the platform comes from mobile, a sign that play on PCs and elsewhere remains popular. Co-founder Sam Kaufmann said Microsoft provides better tools for discovery than the competitive operating systems, and has always had top-notch technology when it comes to debugging, testing and loading apps. ""Microsoft has lots of advanced services that allow someone like an indie developer or single person to get their game released, monetize it well and acquire users in a way that's completely self-serve,"" said Kaufmann. ""It doesn't take a $50,000 or $100,000 advertising budget like it might on Android or iOS."""
691,2016-04-29T07:02:43-0400," Amazon saw tablet shipments rise a whopping 5421.7 percent in the first quarter of the year, a new study shows, amid a sharp decline for the overall market.   The e-commerce giant shipped 2.2 million tablets in the first three months of 2016, compared to around 40,000 in the same time last year, helped by its low cost Fire tablet, according to the analysis firm International Data Corporation (IDC).   ""The low-cost Fire tablet is certainly not the first of its kind, but its success speaks to Amazon's prowess as a household brand and a distribution powerhouse,"" IDC said in a press release on Thursday.   But there is one major caveat.    ""Though the year-over-year growth is an astronomical 5421.7 percent, it is important to note that Amazon's 1Q15 lineup featured a 6 inch tablet which was not counted by IDC as it did not meet the requirements of our taxonomy,"" the research firm said. The six inch tablet is the Amazon Fire HD 6 which was not counted as it did not meet IDC's requirements for a ""tablet"".   Overall, global tablet shipments hit 39.6 million, a 14.7 percent decline from the 46.4 million in the first quarter of 2015.   So-called slate tablets continued to decline but still accounted for 87.6 percent of all shipments. The bright spot for the market was that 2-in-1 tablets or those with detachable keyboards like Apple's iPad Pro, experienced triple-digit year-over-year growth with shipments of more than 4.9 million units, a record high for the first quarter of a calendar year, according to IDC.   This 2-in-1 space is heating up. Apple released the iPad Pro last year, while Microsoft, which is credited with inventing the category, recently launched the Surface Book. Chinese firm Lenovo also has products in the category and Huawei entered the fray in February with the unveiling of the Mate Book.    And IDC says that Apple is beating Microsoft at its own game, for now.    ""With the PC industry in decline, the detachable market stands to benefit as consumers and enterprises seek to replace their aging PCs with detachables,"" Jitesh Ubrani, senior research analyst at IDC, said in a press release.   ""Apple's recent foray into this segment has garnered them an impressive lead in the short term, although continued long-term success may prove challenging as a higher entry price point staves off consumers and iOS has yet to prove its enterprise-readiness, leaving plenty of room for Microsoft and their hardware partners to reestablish themselves."""

694,2016-06-30T07:10:42-0400,"  America's most valuable technology firms such as Microsoft and Google are unlikely to maintain their leading positions in the next 20 years, a top Silicon Valley venture capitalist and former Apple executive has warned.  Speaking at the Viva Technology conference in Paris on Thursday, Joe Schoendorf, a partner at venture capital firm Accel, said that developments in technology would see Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft - the world's biggest tech firms by market capitalization and among the largest companies on the globe, fall behind.   ""Nobody is safe (from disruption)...when I came to the Valley, the dominant force...was called Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Snow White was IBM, they owned 90 percent of the main frame market...in effect, all of those eight companies are gone and then we went to the mini computer companies...then we went to the PC companies, then we went to the server companies...so to sit here and say today's dominant players are forever, is just not going to happen,"" Schoendorf said.   ""The question is how long will they last? Some longer than others…but with all the wonders of nature the platform shifts, and boy are we going to have a platform shift. There is always a group of emerging new stars. If I come back here in 20 years, all five of the companies I just told you about, will not be on the top ten list, I can't tell you which ones, but there will be five new companies that will be on that top 10 or 20 list.""  Schoendorf was the vice president of marketing at Apple Computer (the name of the company before it was changed), in the eighties.   The VC told an anecdote about how he attended the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos for the first time 20 years ago and the major companies on the list were NTT, Coca Cola and General Electric. But those companies have been ""disrupted"" and are not there anymore, Schoendorf said, illustrating how even dominant players can fall behind quickly. "
695,2016-04-26T05:25:01-0400,"  Microsoft has played down the weakness of its cloud computing division in its latest results, saying that nearly three-quarters of its cloud customers are using more than one product on offer.    Third-quarter revenue in its intelligent cloud business grew just 3 percent to $6.1 billion, despite revenue from Azure more than doubling year-over-year. Investors were disappointed and its share price fell when it announced earnings on April 21.    But Azure is just one part of the cloud business which also includes its Office 365 apps and its customer relationship management software Dynamics. Jason Zander, corporate vice-president of Microsoft's Azure team, said that many of its customers are choosing to use several of its cloud products.  ""If you look at the cloud segment, we're actually getting triple digit revenue growth, we have about 85 percent of the Fortune 500 using the Microsoft cloud. Keep in mind our cloud efforts are Office 365, as well as Azure and Dynamics,"" Zander told CNBC in a TV interview.   ""So we have over 74 percent using more than one of those services. So our uptake is going incredibly well from that perspective and this is rarely a good time for us to be pushing for market share and getting more and more customers on board.""  Microsoft has been focusing heavily on the cloud in recent times amid a slowdown in the global personal computer market and the company's mobile division.   But there is intense competition in the space with Amazon Web Services (AWS), the e-commerce giant's cloud business, and the likes of Google and IBM all challenging in the space.    While AWS and IBM are two of the big players in enterprise cloud, Google has yet to make a big bid in the space, but analysts expect that this could be a big driver of the search giant's future earnings. But Zander said that Microsoft and Google would operate in different sectors and would not be in direct competition.   ""We're an enterprise company. We've spent 30 years building enterprise credibility. We see a significant amount of customers, they want to move to the cloud, they want a trusted partner to do that. And so, from that perspective we see really good uptake there,"" Zander told CNBC.    ""I think from a Google perspective, they haven't been an enterprise company for that long, and so I don't see as much competition showing up in those sorts of spaces."" "

RBC said in a that weaker on-the spot sales of Microsoft's server products and its Office line, as well as a shift in the way it recognizes revenue on those products, led to them lowering their expectations.

Baird said in a Friday note ""non-operating losses related to Alphabet's investment portfolio/FX hedges ... were primary drivers of an EPS miss."" The analysts cut their Alphabet price target to $860 from $880, but maintained their ""outperform"" rating on the stock.  Alphabet shares were down 5.4 percent at $737.77.

The company responded by releasing principles for use of its artificial intelligence tools.In its statement, Google said it would have been able to support ""portions"" of the JEDI deal had joint bids been allowed.The news outlet Federal News Network first reported Google's decision.

698,2016-04-21T09:51:34-0400,"  Investors are gearing up for Microsoft's latest quarterly report, and will focus on this key factor: operating expenditures.   ""Some of the head-count reduction they have done in the last calendar year … can drive some upside in the opex side,""Stifel Nicolaus analyst Brad Reback told CNBC.com.   Microsoft, which is expected to post fiscal third-quarter results Thursday after the bell, has been a beacon for financial discipline recently.   In a note Monday, analysts at Stifel said the company has beaten Wall Street's expenses forecast or come in below the midpoint of the company's guidance every quarter since Amy Hood took over as CFO in May 2013.   Analysts polled by Reuters expect earnings per share of 64 cents on revenue of $22.1 billion.   The tech giant expects operating expenditures to range between $7.7 billion and $7.8 billion.   ""The bottom line is we expect this cost discipline to continue, all while the company prioritizes opex spend toward higher growth areas (e.g., commercial cloud) and areas where Microsoft can differentiate,"" Stifel said.   Investors will also pay attention to Microsoft's cloud business, as the company continues its transition from a primarily PC-based company, incorporating products such as Azure and Office 365 into its enterprise business.   Analysts at Nomura said in a note last Thursday that ""Azure adoption is rising and as customers look increasingly to the cloud, we believe Microsoft can leverage its existing relationship with enterprise customers to sell more premium workloads and services in the cloud.""   Last quarter, revenue in Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud business grew 5 percent (11 percent on a constant currency basis) to $6.34 billion. That slightly topped Wall Street's expectations for $6.29 billion, according to StreetAccount.   Within that category, Microsoft said its server products and cloud services revenue increased 10 percent in constant currency, and Azure revenue saw massive 140 percent constant-currency growth. More than one-third of all Fortune 500 companies chose Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility solutions, the company said.   However, not everyone is as optimistic about Microsoft's cloud business.  ""It's very hard for a company that size to move the needle,"" Randy Warren, CIO at Warren Financial, told CNBC.com on Tuesday. ""I don't know if the cloud will be enough.""   The company also had to deal with further deceleration in the PC market.    On April 11, research firm Gartner said worldwide PC shipments declined 9.6 percent year over year in the first quarter, marking the sixth-straight quarter of PC shipment falls.   Still, Warren said the company has done very well recently. ""Clearly they've got a tremendous franchise that [has brought them a lot of money].""   Microsoft shares are only up 1.6 percent in 2016, but have spiked 11 percent in the last three months and 18 percent over the past six months. Microsoft in last 6 months   ""I do expect the stock to continue to outperform the broader market,"" Stifel's Reback said. ""The pace of gain may moderate, given the multiple expansion, but as far as these mega-cap legacy stocks [are concerned], this is one of the best out there.""Last quarter, Microsoft reported earnings per share of 78 cents and $25.69 billion in revenue, easily beating Wall Street's estimates.  —CNBC's Everett Rosenfeld contributed to this report.

The pair have also agreed that they will try to work among themselves to settle any future issues before running to regulators.  ""Microsoft has agreed to withdraw its regulatory complaints against Google, reflecting our changing legal priorities,"" a Microsoft representative said in a statement to Re/code. ""We will continue to focus on competing vigorously for business and for customers.""  Google, meanwhile, offered up a similar statement, affirming that it too will withdraw any regulatory complaints it has made. ""Our companies compete vigorously, but we want to do so on the merits of our products, not in legal proceedings.""  Neither company made any product commitments to one another as part of this deal.   The timing is interesting, coming just as European regulators charge that Google is abusing its position in the Android market. However, both sides say the deal was in the works for some time.   Microsoft says it isn't taking a position on either the European Union case against Android or an earlier EU inquiry with regard to search.

The technology giant posted fiscal third-quarter earnings per share of 62 cents, compared to 61 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the quarter came in at $22.08 billion, against the comparable year-ago figure of $21.73 billion.   Analysts expected Microsoft to report earnings of 64 cents a share on $22.09 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.   Shares of the tech giant traded more than 4 percent lower in after-hours following the release, and fell as much as 5 percent.   Microsoft's international business was hurt by a strong U.S. dollar, as well as declining PC sales. On April 11, research firm Gartner said worldwide PC shipments declined 9.6 percent year over year in the first quarter, marking the sixth-straight quarter of PC shipment falls.   However, its cloud business grew more than expected last quarter.

We will continue to add new members in China and around the world as we grow,"" said PAI in a statement on Tuesday.The inclusion of Baidu in the group comes as Chinese and U.S. companies are looking to ramp up cooperation on AI, despite a looming political scuffle between the U.S. and China over technology transfers.Last year China laid out a roadmap to become a world leader in AI by 2025, with plans to invest roughly $400 billion in the industry in the coming years.The ambitions have rankled the U.S. government, which has discussed plans to bolster security reviews of cutting-edge technology, including AI, over fears that China could access technology of strategic military importance.China's AI roadmap encourages technology sharing between private, public and military research groups.Despite the clash, U.S. companies have expanded their AI presence in China while Baidu and other Chinese firms have launched AI research labs in the United States.Last month China's cyber ministry hosted Google, Amazon Inc and Microsoft Corp at its annual AI forum. All three companies have launched AI research labs in China over the past year, despite tightening censorship and data restrictions that limit the companies' involvement in the market.At the forum, top government officials stressed that China's development of AI technology would be ethically conducted, adding that they have plans to retrain workers who lose their jobs to AI.(Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

On Monday, when bullish trades outpaced bearish ones, a trader bet Microsoft could rally another 5 percent post- earnings on Friday.    In the wager, the trader purchased 4,500 May 59/61.50 call spreads for 30 cents each. A call spread is a bullish strategy where a trader will buy a call and then sell a higher strike call to offset the cost. The goal is for the stock to rise to the strike you are short, or in this case as high as $61.50 by May expiration.    ""If you look at the 20-year chart, the highs on Y2K was [around] $59.97. ... If this trader is right you're going to have very close to a new all-time high,"" Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com said Monday on CNBC's ""Fast Money.""

705,2015-09-08T08:15:50-0400,"  Microsoft confirmed the acquisition Tuesday of Israeli cloud cybersecurity start-up Adallom on Tuesday, in a bid to bolster its security capabilities as businesses deal with an increasing number of online threats.  CNBC reported on Monday that the deal was likely to close and be announced this week and Adallom and Microsoft both confirmed the acquisition in separate blog posts on Tuesday.    The two companies did not disclose the size of the deal but it is ""one of the largest"" of the group's recent acquisitions, a source close to the situation has told CNBC, adding that the price tag is """"quite a few hundred million dollars"".    ""With more frequent and advanced cybersecurity attacks continuing to make headlines, customer concerns around security remain top of mind,"" Takeshi Numoto, corporate vice president of cloud and enterprise marketing at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post.   Adallom is the latest company to be snapped up by Microsoft which has been on a buying spree over the past year as the company pushes its fast-growing businesses such as the cloud unit.   The company's commercial cloud revenue grew 88 percent year-on-year for Microsoft in the fourth quarter. This includes its Office 365, Microsoft's suite of business productivity applications such as email, and Azure, its cloud platform.   Security is one of the top concerns for businesses following some high-profile hacking attacks on the likes of Sony Pictures last year andadultery website Ashley Madison last month.   And the likely Adallom acquisition comes as Microsoft continues to diversify its business away from just its Windows operating system and struggling smartphone unit. Having Adallom's solutions would expand Microsoft's range of cybersecurity solutions to businesses as it continues to focus on pushing its products and services to enterprises.   Last year, Microsoft bought another Israeli cybersecurity start-up called Aorato which made a product spefically aimed at Microsoft users. The product was aimed at protecting the so-called Active Directory -- a database that authorizes users to access a company's systems.   But unlike Aorato, Adallom's services are not only designed to work with Microsoft's cloud products. Adallom can also secure cloud platforms such as GoogleApps and Salesforce which is highly used by businesses.   Adallom offers services such as the ability to understand how and by who a company's cloud is being used, notify a firm about suspicious activity in its cloud and block cyber threats.   The firm was founded in 2012 by alumni of the Israeli Intelligence Corps. Adallom is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, but has an office in Israel. The employees will not be relocated to Redmond, Washington, a person familiar with the matter said.   "

""I don't want him to feel like it was something for a PR purpose. It really was something else.""While the name was certainly inspired by the search engine, Kai and his wife had also read an old English children's book about an imaginary creature called Google, and felt that naming their son after a big number — a googol — would represent how many friends he would make in his life.""It was something special and unique,"" he said. ""It also made a buzz.""For several years, he kept a blog about his son, which is still viewable via the Internet Archive.Karen Wickre, the former Google employee who wrote the company's blog post, still remembers the surprise and says she called up Kai before publishing.""It felt like an indicator of how well known and familiar Google was getting at the time,"" she said. ""But I don't think we viewed it as a point of pride as much as, 'People are funny.'""Kai says he still loves and trusts Google's services, despite some of the company's recent privacy failures.""I applied for a lot of jobs at Google actually,"" he said. ""I was doing some organic search engine optimization, some growth hacking. … I don't think I made it through their filtering system.""In 2011, another Silicon Valley giant got a shout-out when an Israeli couple named their daughter Like.Vardit Adler says the inspiration came from Facebook, but that she and her husband also loved the meaning of the word — ""to give good feelings to others"" — and thought that it sounded nice in both Hebrew and English.""People at first are surprised but after knowing Like and our family, will accept the name,"" said Adler, who works as an algorithm engineer.Unlike the Kais, the Adlers never heard directly from Facebook, even after their story was written up by the likes of tech news sites Mashable and Gizmodo. Vardit Adler herself didn't even have her own Facebook account until six months after her daughter's birth but does still check it today. She enjoys the app but believes that company needs to be clearer with its privacy and data policies.""Our older daughters have Facebook accounts, too, but both of them are more active on Instagram,"" Adler said. ""Like has a Facebook account that my husband maintains.""Four years before Like Adler's earthly debut, a baby girl named Vista Avalon Simser, named after the Microsoft Windows operating system, was born.Her dad, a software developer named Bil Simser, wrote at the time that if he and his wife had had a boy, his first name would have been Dev, for developer, and his initials would have been DOS, the name of Microsoft's former text-based operating system. Having a daughter would have been an upgrade, they joked, hence Vista.""Vista (the operating system) hadn't been released yet, but we looked at it on paper. Vista. I liked the sound of it. True, it was spawned from the name of Microsoft's next operating system but it was also a word seeded in the Italian language (from visto) meaning a sight,"" he wrote.While the Simsers, Adlers and Kais bestowed their children with brand names for free, other enterprising parents cashed in on their choices.At the start of the dot-com crash, an American couple reportedly received $5,000 for naming their son after the Internet Underground Music Archive, or Iuma for short.""My wife liked the idea because the child's grandma said this baby would bring prosperity, and this contest could be what she was talking about,"" father Travis Thornhill told the BBC at the time. ""Plus, the kid will have a cool story when he grows up.""The start-up imploded not long afterward, though, and based on Facebook, it seems that Iuma Dylan-Lucas Thornhill just goes by Dylan now.Laurel Sutton, co-founder of professional naming company Catchword, says that names given for publicity or prizes rarely stick. And without an official sponsorship, a brand might not want the attention of having a baby named after it.""Unless the company is sponsoring it, they would likely feel a bit ambivalent about it,"" said Sutton. ""On the one hand, it gets them more publicity and you want brand evangelists. But on the other, what if that kid grows up to be a serial killer? Companies like when their brands are used in ways they can control.""While the state of Sonora, Mexico did pass a law in 2014 explicitly banning parents from naming their child Facebook, there haven't been any recent news stories about kids getting saddled with high-tech names. An opposite scenario has caused trouble instead: A mother recently went viral after she wrote to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos about how her daughter, Alexa, has faced merciless teasing because of the company's smart assistant.""Kids are telling her, 'Turn on my TV, tell me today's weather,'"" the mother told NBC New York. ""They laugh at her and treat her like a servant, and this has been an ongoing issue, everywhere we go.""WATCH: Google's Larry Page has backed two flying-car start-ups — here's a look inside one of them"

708,2015-09-07T08:35:16-0400,"  Microsoft is set to buy Israeli cloud cybersecurity start-up Adallom in ""one of the largest"" of the group's recent acquisitions, a source close to the situation has told CNBC.    The deal is likely to close and be announced this week with the price tag set to be ""quite a few hundred million dollars"", the person said, choosing to remain anonymous because the information isn't public. The source did not reveal the exact price but said it would be bigger than any recent deals.   Adallom is poised to be the latest company to be snapped up by Microsoft which has been on a buying spree over the past year as the company pushes its fast-growing businesses such as the cloud unit.  The company's commercial cloud revenue grew 88 percent year-on-year for Microsoft in the fourth quarter. This includes its Office 365, Microsoft's suite of business productivity applications such as email, and Azure, its cloud platform.    Security is one of the top concerns for businesses following some high-profile hacking attacks on the likes of Sony Pictures last year andadultery website Ashley Madison last month.    And the likely Adallom acquisition comes as Microsoft continues to diversify its business away from just its Windows operating system and struggling smartphone unit. Having Adallom's solutions would expand Microsoft's range of cybersecurity solutions to businesses as it continues to focus on pushing its products and services to enterprises.    Adallom did not respond to CNBC's request for comment at the time of publication.    Last year, Microsoft bought another Israeli cybersecurity start-up called Aorato which made a product spefically aimed at Microsoft users. The product was aimed at protecting the so-called Active Directory -- a database that authorizes users to access a company's systems.   But unlike Aorato, Adallom's services are not only designed to work with Microsoft's cloud products. Adallom can also secure cloud platforms such as GoogleApps and Salesforce which is highly used by businesses.   Adallom offers services such as the ability to understand how and by who a company's cloud is being used, notify a firm about suspicious activity in its cloud and block cyber threats.    The firm was founded in 2012 by alumni of the Israeli Intelligence Corps. Adallom is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, but has an office in Israel. The employees will not be relocated to Redmond, Washington, a person familiar with the matter said.    "

Blockchain is the technology that underlies the cryptocurrency bitcoin. It works like a huge, decentralized ledger for bitcoin which records every transaction and stores this information on a global network so it cannot be tampered with. Banks feel blockchain technology can be utilized in areas from remittances to securities exchanges.   Banks around the world are looking into the technology which could disrupt the processes carried out by lenders.   Microsoft and the R3 Consortium, a group of the world's biggest banks including JPMorgan and Citigroup that is dedicated to researching and delivering new financial technology, said they would work together to ""accelerate the use of distributed ledger technologies, also known as blockchain"".    Under the terms of the ""strategic partnership"", Microsoft Azure will be the cloud service provider for R3.  Microsoft will provide cloud-based tools, services and infrastructure for R3 as well as dedicated technical architects, project managers, lab assistants and support services, the companies said.   ""With intelligent, cloud-based technology, R3 and member banks will experiment and learn faster, accelerating distributed ledger technology deployment,"" Peggy Johnson, executive vice president of global business development at Microsoft, said in a press release.    R3 and its members will have access to Microsoft's blockchain partners which includes the likes of start-ups Ethereum and Ripple. ."

However, the program once again went wrong and Tay's account was set to private after it began repeating the same message over and over to other Twitter users.   According to a Microsoft, the account was reactivated by accident during testing.   ""Tay remains offline while we make adjustments,"" a spokesperson for the company told CNBC via email. ""As part of testing, she was inadvertently activated on Twitter for a brief period of time.""   Twitter users speculated the program was caught in a feedback loop where it was constantly replying to its own messages.  @psychicpebble Tay is back, and she's hungry...   Tay was first launched last Wednesday, but had to be deactivated a few days later after it began writing messages using racist and sexual language.

""We are deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from Tay, which do not represent who we are or what we stand for,"" Lee wrote on the company's blog.According to Lee, the program was created as a ""chatbot"" to entertain 18-to-24 year olds and learn from interacting with humans.  However, some Twitter users were able to manipulate the program to send out the offensive messages.   ""Unfortunately, in the first 24 hours of coming online, a coordinated attack by a subset of people exploited a vulnerability in Tay,"" Lee explained. ""As a result, Tay tweeted wildly inappropriate and reprehensible words and images.""   Alastair Bathgate, CEO of Blue Prism, a software company that develops robotic process automation systems, said the incident proves that Microsoft has not learnt to control its AI program.   ""You can be devious with these things because, essentially, they are not that intelligent,"" he told CNBC over the phone.

711,2018-09-12T00:00:00-0400,"WASHINGTON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - After months of waging a behind-the-scenes war against President Donald Trump's trade tariffs that have escalated far beyond what business groups once imagined, more than 60 U.S. industry groups are launching a coalition on Wednesday to take the fight public.Emergence of the group, Americans for Free Trade, comes after Trump has warmed to the use of tariffs, implementing billions of dollars worth in an effort to use them as a threat to win concessions or in the belief they will create U.S. jobs.""A lot of other interest groups thought they wouldn't go this long or go this deep, but the layering effect (of tariffs) has finally gotten everyone to say: 'Enough is enough,""' said Nicole Vasilaros, the top lobbyist for the National Marine Manufacturers Association, whose members are weighing laying off workers after seeing costs rise as much as 35 percent.Trump has imposed 25 percent tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, mostly industrial machinery and intermediate electronics parts such as semiconductors.A pending $200 billion list would extend further into consumer goods, and the threat of an additional $267 billion would basically cover every Chinese export to the United States. China has threatened retaliation, which could include action against U.S. companies operating there.Washington has demanded that Beijing better protect American intellectual property, cut its U.S. trade surplus, allow U.S. companies greater access to its markets and roll back its high-technology industrial subsidy programs.The business coalition includes groups representing some of the nation's largest companies. Among them, the American Petroleum Institute, which represents the largest refiners like Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp, and the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which represents companies like Target Corp and Autozone Inc.""There has been a lot of work that has been going on over the last eight months to try to persuade the president and the administration that tariffs are not going to work. Our view is that it's not too late,"" said Dean Garfield, chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, whose members include Microsoft Corp, Google owner Alphabet Inc and Apple Inc.While Trump threatened tariffs on the campaign trail and ended America's participation in the Trans Pacific Partnership, a large multinational trade pact, few observers took his threat seriously.Trump has since demonstrated he is serious on tariffs, ramping up the attacks on China, threatening car import levies and pushing for a more pro-American North American Free Trade Agreement, even at the risk of killing the three-country pact.RETAIL LEADThe coalition grew out of weekly meetings featuring industries organized by the National Retail Federation (NRF), whose members include Amazon.com, Macy's Inc and Walmart Inc.""This is almost every sector of the American economy involved,"" said David French, the top lobbyist for the NRF.The group will target Republican members of Congress in five states - Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana and Tennessee. While not engaging in electioneering ahead of Nov. 6 elections where control of Congress is at stake, it will urge constituents to discuss the trade issue with lawmakers. The group plans to expand that effort to a dozen states by the end of the year.Members of Congress have failed to slow Trump's protectionist march and few have been willing to speak publicly for fear of arousing the ire of Trump and the Republican base.The coalition hopes to push Republican lawmakers to press Trump to abandon tariffs by convincing him that his trade policy could undo his tax and deregulation push.""The sugar high of the lower taxes and the reduced rules that have fueled the stock market since the president was elected are in jeopardy,"" said Gary Shapiro, head of the Consumer Technology Association, whose members include IBM Corp and Facebook Inc He warned that some of his members were considering layoffs.Steve Pasierb, head of the Toy Association, whose members include Mattel Inc, Hasbro Inc and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc said members of Congress were slow to be persuaded they needed to be concerned.""It's been this kind of slow build that got worse and worse and worse. I don't think anybody in D.C. saw this coming."" (Reporting by Ginger Gibson; Editing by Peter Cooney)"
712,2016-03-28T15:53:19-0400,"It's deja vu, sort of.With Microsoft reportedly in the mix for a potential acquisition of Yahoo, it's worth looking back on similar discussions that were taking place eight years ago at this time.On Feb. 1, 2008, in what would still be by far the software maker's largest ever acquisition, Microsoft offered close to $45 billion for Yahoo. Both companies were getting trounced by Google in search and online ads. Combining the two, so Microsoft thought, would create a credible challenger.Despite representing a 62 percent premium over its market value at the time, Yahoo rejected the offer. Co-founder and then CEO Jerry Yang said the bid ""substantially undervalues Yahoo.""Three months, another $5 billion and another rejection later, Microsoft withdrew its bid, deciding against taking a hostile offer to Yahoo's shareholders.Today, Yahoo is valued at $33.4 billion, or roughly $16 billion less than what Microsoft was willing to pay in 2008. The S&amp;P 500, by contrast, has gained 45 percent since Microsoft pulled its bid on May 3 of that year. ""They should've taken the offer — the board just didn't do what they should've done,"" said Martin Pyykkonen, an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities who has a ""sell"" rating on the stock. Pyykkonen was covering Yahoo at the time and recalls the deal as being ""such a no-brainer.""Re/code reported on Thursday that Microsoft is considering participating in an acquisition of Yahoo's core business, citing sources familiar with the matter. The story says those assets are deemed worth $6 billion to $8 billion, though Yahoo's board wants $10 billion.Most of Yahoo's current value, of course, is wrapped up in its Alibaba stake, which it purchased in 2005 for $1 billion and is now worth close to $24 billion. Back in 2008, Alibaba ""really hadn't flourished,"" Pyykkonen said, meaning Yahoo's core advertising assets were still seen as valuable. One thing to remember when looking at Yahoo shares now versus then: Ignore the actual stock price. Monday's price of $35.20 is actually worth much less than the $33 a share Microsoft was willing to pay then, thanks to the magic of stock buybacks. The company's aggressive repurchase plan means that Yahoo now has 946.8 million shares outstanding, down from 1.34 billion eight years ago. Yahoo said in its latest earnings call that during the new management's tenure, the company has bought back more than $9 billion worth of shares and ""reduced diluted share count by over 20 percent."""
713,2016-05-31T10:37:53-0400,"Facebook, Twitter, Google's YouTube and Microsoft pledged on Tuesday to review requests for the removal of hateful content posted on their platforms within 24 hours as part of a code of conduct agreed with EU regulators.Authorities across Europe have been trying in recent months to get social platforms to crack down on rising online racism following the refugee crisis, with some even threatening action against the companies.European Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said tackling illegal online hate speech has taken on added urgency because of the increasing use of social media by terrorist groups to radicalize young people and spread violence and hatred.The European Commission said the four web giants will review the majority of valid notifications for removal of illegal hate speech in less than 24 hours and remove or disable access to such content if necessary."
714,2016-03-24T19:58:11-0400,"According to numerous sources, Microsoft execs have been meeting with private equity firms mulling bids to buy Yahoo and telling investors the company might be willing to lend significant financing to their efforts.As most know, Yahoo has said it is for sale. Some question the company's commitment to the process, given how glacial it has been, which many attribute to CEO Marissa Mayer's antipathy toward it, favoring her own turnaround efforts instead.Today, activist shareholder Starboard Value said as much, mounting a long expected proxy challenge to Yahoo and naming its own slate of directors to replace current ones.Starboard's Jeff Smith noted that the new board was needed to bring ""credibility to a process that has been publicly criticized repeatedly for being too slow, fraught with conflicts of interest and very difficult for highly qualified and motivated strategic and financial buyers to access much needed diligence information.""Every single possible buyer I have spoken too this week agreed in spades, with many calling the Yahoo sale effort a farce. The current Yahoo board has said it is not, but the credibility of the current Yahoo board is — let's be honest — under some much deserved scrutiny.In any case, adding Microsoft into the mix does give this process some seriousness. Microsoft's partnerships and acquisition strategy head Peggy Johnson is part of the effort, as well as others at Microsoft, sources said (you can hear my Re/code Decode podcast interview with her from last fall below).To be clear, the software giant has made no commitments so far to any investors and any discussions now are exploratory. But sources said that the reason for providing financing would be because Microsoft wants to ensure that if Yahoo is sold that whoever buys it will be a good partner going forward. That makes sense, since Microsoft has close search and advertising ties with Yahoo, part of a longtime partnership.That deal was struck after Microsoft made a hostile bid to buy Yahoo in 2008. At the time, former CEO Steve Ballmer offered $31 a share, which then was worth about $45 billion.More from Re/code: Blendle Wants to Sell You Journalism on the Web, One Story at a Time Silicon Valley's Homogeneous 'Rich Douchebags' Won't Win Forever, Says Investor Chamath PalihapitiyaIsraeli Firm Reportedly Helping FBI Crack San Bernardino Phone (Updated)Ultimately, the effort was unsuccessful, but it was ugly by more friendly tech standards.Since then, the companies have had a more cooperative relationship, although there was some recent tension when Mayer tried to get out of parts of its current search deal via a lawsuit that failed. She ended up renegotiating the deal a year ago on more favorable terms for Yahoo and later signed another search deal with Google too.Preserving its current status is important to Microsoft, said sources, which is why it has been mulling the financing of possible Yahoo buyers, who will have to come up with billions of dollars in cash to be competitive. ""If Microsoft put in a billion, it would cost them almost nothing,"" said one investor who had spoken to the company. ""It's a minor thing and it buys them a lot.""Yahoo's market cap is currently $32.5 billion, but that includes its stakes in its Asian assets. After the spin-off of its AlibabaGroup assets and minusing out its shares of Yahoo Japan, most peg the price of its core business at $6 billion to $8 billion.But sources close to Yahoo's board said it wants $10 billion in a sale. (By way of comparison, I want a pretty pony from Microsoft comms head Frank Shaw and have a better chance of getting it.)Sources within Microsoft said the company had no interest in making a more significant bid, but others do. This week, sources said, Yahoo has begun engaging with ""strategic"" bidders that include AT&amp;T, Verizon and Comcast. PE and other investment firms will come next, the sources said, and those interested include Advent International, Vista Equity Partners (this one interests me the most), TPG, KKR and others.A Microsoft spokesman who will not buy me a pony anytime soon declined to comment."
715,2016-03-23T10:14:03-0400,"When Google hired VMware co-founder Diane Greene to run its cloud business late last year, the company was clearly indicating that third place isn't good enough.Amazon.com and Microsoft have built sizable leads in cloud infrastructure, capturing billions of dollars that businesses are spending to offload their computing and storage needs. IBM is third, followed by Google.Greene, who ran VMware from 1998 to 2008, will talk publicly about her progress versus the competition on Wednesday at the Google Cloud Platform user conference in San Francisco. It's Greene's first major appearance since taking the helm. One not-so-subtle participant at the conference is Netflix, which just happens to be one of Amazon Web Services' marquee customers.Google enters the event with momentum, after reportedly winning some business from Apple, another big AWS customer. (The company is also set to announce Wednesday that it won some of Home Depot's cloud business.)""This win helps Google Cloud Platform catch up to Amazon and Microsoft, at least in terms of perception, as a real third player in the space instead of a distant third,"" Evan Wilson, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, wrote in a March 16 report.  From a numbers standpoint, Google is actually a distant fourth in the $23 billion cloud infrastructure services market, according to Synergy Research Group. AWS ranks first with 31 percent, followed by Microsoft Azure at 9 percent, IBM at 7 percent and Google Cloud Platform at 4 percent, Synergy data show. That means of Google parent Alphabet's $75 billion in revenue, less than $1 billion came from cloud infrastructure. Gartner projects industry growth of greater than 30 percent annually through 2018 as more of the world's largest and data-heavy companies shift applications from their own data centers to the cloud to gain speed, efficiency and access across employees' devices.Google faces a big challenge in finding its place in the market. Among start-ups and developers, AWS has set the standard. Its first product launched a decade ago and the service has become so transformative to the current generation of Internet companies that it's established a near-monopoly in venture capital portfolios. To show that it's not just for emerging businesses, AWS has signed deals with Pfizer, Comcast (parent company of CNBC) and even the CIA.Microsoft is the established name in the enterprise, having spent the past three-plus decades selling Windows software and servers and creating the world's biggest software business. Microsoft already has the sales force, client relationships and customer support systems in place, enabling it to sell to some companies that may be wary of Amazon's e-commerce roots.Read MoreMicrosoft cloud grows, but dwarfed by old stuffGoogle doesn't have enterprise support in its DNA or a lengthy history in the market. What it does have is a popular suite of cloud business apps like Gmail, word-processing documents, spreadsheets and calendars. ""It's a huge asset,"" said Sacha Labourey, CEO of CloudBees, a developer of software that eases app deployment. ""Creating a culture of enterprise sales and support is Diane's biggest challenge.""  Google also knows how to build data centers as well as any modern-day Internet company. Just consider the technical sophistication required for processing over 1 trillion searches per year and billions of YouTube views a day.   ""We are able to take that infrastructure and computing power and optimize it for all customers,"" Google CEO Sundar Pichai said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings conference call.   Pichai said that much of Google's increase in capital expenditures this year would be dedicated to bolstering computing capacity. The company has said it's adding cloud data centers in Oregon and Japan in 2016.  Greene's success in cloud may hinge on her group's ability to build and sell technology that's fundamentally different from Google's rivals. They're all competing on speed, reliability and of course price, but is there anything Google offers that nobody else can match? Google's cloud division promotes products for data analytics, visualization and high-speed data processing, which should all be advantages for a company known for its wealth of data scientists. It also wraps in a host of open-source tools developed internally.  Pacific Crest's Wilson cites recent deals with companies including Snapchat, PricewaterhouseCoopers, General Mills and Best Buy as a sign that enterprises are taking Google seriously.""If Google continues this momentum, it will definitely be a factor in the conversation,"" he wrote.

Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo no longer simply rely on selling consoles and games to make a profit. These days, major gaming companies make money from in-game microtransactions, such as selling additional downloadable content or perks, or subscription services, such as apps to stream music and TV.    ""It's more and more important for those manufacturers to build brand loyalty by locking users into their ecosystem of games, services and online multiplayer components,"" Steinberg said. ""Because once you are locked into that suite of services  you are much more reticent, or much less willing, to change or move over to another gaming system.""   Gaming companies benefit from players who actively build their online profiles and become involved in the digital community. Gamers who have robust friend lists for multiplayer games or have racked up a large number of in-game trophies and achievements, are much less likely to abandon their console in favor of another brand. If other platforms were to agree to Microsoft's cross-platform play, Steinberg says that the companies would need to determine who is responsible for users' data.   ""Protecting users' data and ensuring they have a safe and secure place to play is always a top priority for us and remains so as we enable developers to support cross-network play,"" a Microsoft spokesman said when asked if the companies would have to share users and their data. That type information is richly valued, because companies use it to ferret out trends in gaming habits, shape marketing strategies and direct product development.  King Digital, the developer behind the ""Candy Crush"" series for mobile devices, changed the difficulty level of its free-to-play app after discovering that the majority of users stopped using the product around Level 65, according to the Toronto Star. Making the level easier enticed many users to play further into the game. While game developers would likely love to attract players from different platforms, Steinberg said, ""From a manufacturer's standpoint, there's not necessarily incentive to do it. In fact, there may be incentive to do anything but.""   Sony, Nintendo, Ubisoft, Valve, Electronic Arts, Activision and Square Enix did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. "

Contrary to an earlier statement, Microsoft users can still use the virtual currency to buy content in the Windows and Xbox stores. Earlier on Monday, the software giant mistakenly suggested it had stopped accepting payment in bitcoin. ""We apologize for inaccurate information that was inadvertently posted to a Microsoft site, which is currently being corrected,"" a spokesman told CNBC. A now-deleted post on Microsoft's website indicated there was no more bitcoin for Windows 10 and Windows 10 mobile users. The post was picked up by tech site Softpedia Sunday and sent the technology blogsphere buzzing.    ""You can no longer redeem Bitcoin into your Microsoft account,"" the errant post read. ""Existing balances in your account will still be available for purchases from Microsoft Store, but can't be refunded.""  In December 2014, Microsoft began accepting bitcoins for Windows 10 store purchases from users in the United States. Transactions were made through the bitcoin processor BitPay.   BitPay said it saw the volume of bitcoin transactions grow 110 percent in 2015 versus a year earlier, according to a blog post this January.

721,2016-05-05T07:30:00-0400,"Enterprise software company Pivotal will close a $253 million funding round led by new investor Ford and joined by Microsoft, GE, EMC and VMWare, the companies announced Thursday. It marks the second-biggest start-up investment this year, behind augmented reality company Magic Leap.   Fortune 100 companies like Ford are betting big that Pivotal can keep scaling its platform, which lets clients build and update cloud-based software more quickly. By giving developers the power to roll out continuous updates across any cloud platform, like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, the firm hopes to be the brains behind projects like personalized health care, connected cars and even space travel.    ""We're deeply involved in a lot of pretty big things,"" said Rob Mee, CEO of Pivotal. ""It's all going according to plan. A quite ambitious plan.""    Pivotal is behind projects like FordPass, an app that lets users find parking, track fuel levels and find Ford dealers, and promises to sync with new connected cars like the 2017 Ford Escape. Pivotal said it helped reduce the project delivery time from months to weeks at Ford.    It comes at a time when well-heeled legacy companies like Ford and GE are finding they need to also be world-class software developers, Mee said.   Indeed, Pivotal addresses a pain point consultants at PricewaterhouseCoopers have called the ""Goldilocks syndrome"" — changing regulations, productivity pressures and complex customer engagement models that have left businesses unsure how much to customize their software. Too much leaves a system expensive to maintain, while generic versions force businesses to cram their business model into the software's functions.   The new funding is more than double Pivotal's last $105 million round from GE and dwarfs the biggest funding round of MongoDB, a similar company. It leaves Pivotal valued at about $2.8 billion by some estimates, even as many venture capitalists report doling out less cash than last year. ""It's pretty exciting to have that kind of validation from a company that's been around for 100 years, like Ford,"" Mee said.  "

He warned however, that it may be a little late to trade big tech.  Trader Steve Grasso agreed with Najarian's last point, saying he's not bullish on IBM and a lot of these other big tech companies. He said that the environment of low interest rates has pushed people into riskier assets as they search for yield outside of traditional safe-haven government bonds. Grasso cautioned that the market could reprice soon.Trader Guy Adami said Cisco is an interesting stock because not only is it ""reasonably valued,"" but it also reports earnings in August, much later than some of the other major companies.

726,2016-02-03T04:23:08-0500,"  Microsoft has acquired Swiftkey, a London-based artificial intelligence (AI) start-up that makes a predictive keyboard for smartphones, the company announced on Tuesday.    The U.S. technology giant paid $250 million for Swiftkey, as the FT first reported. The figure was confirmed by a CNBC source.   Swiftkey raised an undisclosed amount of money last year and the buyout represents an exit for investors including Index Ventures and Octopus Ventures.    The acquisition is a continuation of Microsoft's buying spree as it looks to become the dominant player in productivity apps on mobile and desktop. In just over a year, Microsoft has bought email app Acompli, calendar app Sunrise and Wunderlist, an organizational app that lets you create to-do lists.   'Productivity', which refers to digital services to help people organize their lives such as calendars and notes, has been a big buzzword within Microsoft since Satya Nadella took over as chief executive as the company pushes its cloud-based software and services.   But artificial intelligence in particular has also been a key focus for U.S. technology companies on the whole. In 2014, Google snapped up DeepMind, which has demonstrated its ability to master the ancient Chinese game of Go. In January, Apple acquired an emotion-detecting start-up called Emotient.    Microsoft has also been developing software in the field of artificial intelligence. Its digital personal assistant called Cortana – like Apple's Siri – is an example of this. Swiftkey develops a smartphone keyboard that allows people to swipe across different letters in one stroke to spell a word. It can ""learn"" your typing style and claims to make typing faster.  The acquisition of Swiftkey will give Microsoft an expert team in AI.    The British start-up has not had the most comfortable ride as of late. It is installed on over 300 million devices but accounts for TouchType Limited, SwiftKey's registered company, showed revenues fell from to £9.9 million in 2013 to £8.4 million in 2014. It used to charge $4 for its app too, but scrapped the fee in 2014.    ""Our number one focus has always been to build the best possible products for our users. This will not change. Our apps will continue to be available on Android and iOS, for free. We are as committed as ever to improving them in new and innovative ways,"" Swiftkey co-founders Jon Reynolds and Ben Medlock, said in a statement on Tuesday.    "
727,2016-01-28T18:44:45-0500," Microsoft reported quarterly earnings and revenue on Thursday that handily beat analysts' expectations.   The company posted fiscal second-quarter adjusted earnings per share of 78 cents on $25.69 billion in revenue. Analysts had expected Microsoft to report earnings of about 71 cents per share on $25.26 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.  Shares in the computing giant jumping more than 8 percent in after-hours trading, but then gave back some of those gains.   ""Businesses everywhere are using the Microsoft Cloud as their digital platform to drive their ambitious transformation agendas,"" Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO said in a statement. ""Businesses are also piloting Windows 10, which will drive deployments beyond 200 million active devices.""  The company said it returned $6.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends during its quarter ended in December 2015.   Microsoft's fiscal second-quarter earnings per share rose 11 percent from an adjusted 70 cents in the year-earlier period, and its adjusted revenue fell about 2 percent from the $26.14 billion it recorded for the previous period.  Investors are particularly enthusiastic about Microsoft's future business. The company reported deferred revenue, or sales that have been booked but not yet recorded, of $25 billion, topping the average analyst estimate of about $23 billion.   ""It shows that momentum is building for Microsoft in 2016 rather than slowing, and that's different from what we're hearing from other enterprise tech companies,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets who has a ""buy"" rating on the stock.   As with other recent quarters, investors are expected to key into Microsoft's cloud business, which many believe represents a crucial component for its future growth. The computing giant has been transitioning from a primarily PC-based company into a cloud-focused one, incorporating products such as Azure and Office 365 into its commercial and enterprise business.   Revenue in Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud business grew 5 percent (11 percent on a constant currency basis) to $6.34 billion. That slightly topped Wall Street's expectations for $6.29 billion, according to StreetAccount.   Within that category, Microsoft said its server products and cloud services revenue increased 10 percent in constant currency, and Azure revenue saw massive 140 percent constant-currency growth. More than one-third of all Fortune 500 companies chose Microsoft's Enterprise Mobility solutions, the company said. ""It's really about cloud at this point, it's the Rock of Gibraltar in terms of what Microsoft's seeing,"" Ives said. ""Compare those to other tech dinosaurs — Oracle, HP — that they're competing against. ... They picked a right time to bet on cloud.""  But PC sales will also capture attention, as those (long-slipping) sales continue to be a major part of Microsoft's revenue. Katherine Egbert, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray, said in a Jan. 15 note that the weak PC sales number led her to trim her revenue forecast, citing a ""faster-than-expected deceleration in global PC shipments"" as a risk to the company.   Microsoft said its ""More Personal Computing"" revenue declined 5 percent (down 2 percent in constant currency) to $12.7 billion — primarily due to a fall in phone and Windows revenue. Wall Street had expected $12.29 billion for the business, according to data from StreetAccount.   On the Windows 10 front, Nadella said there are now more than 200 million monthly active devices — with the rate of adoption outpacing any of Microsoft's previous operating systems. The company has a goal of 1 billion active devices on the OS.   Revenue from Microsoft's Surface devices increased 29 percent in constant currency, the company said, citing the launch of its Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. Phone revenue, however, declined 49 percent controlling for currency.   Amy Hood, Microsoft executive vice president and chief financial officer, said on the company's earnings call that the personal computing segment's outperformance was due in large part to better-than-expected device launches.   ""It was a strong holiday season for Microsoft highlighted by Surface and Xbox,"" Kevin Turner, chief operating officer at Microsoft, said in the company's quarterly release. ""Our commercial business executed well as our sales teams and partners helped customers realize the value of Microsoft's cloud technologies across Azure, Office 365 and CRM Online.""   Xbox Live's monthly active users grew about 30 percent against the year-ago period to 48 million, and gaming revenue grew 9 percent in constant currency, the company said.   Looking ahead to the fiscal third quarter, Microsoft said it expects revenue of $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion in its Productivity and Business Processes segment (compared to Wall Street's expectation of $6.80 billion). For the Intelligent Cloud segment, the company is looking for revenue between $6.1 billion and $6.3 billion (compared to consensus $6.29 billion), and for More Personal Computing it expects $9.1 billion to $9.4 billion in revenue (compared to $9.32 billion).   The company expects about 4 points of total foreign exchange headwinds for its third quarter, Hood said.  Microsoft announced in February 2014 that Nadella would become its CEO. Since that time, Nadella has sought to reinvigorate the more than $400 billion market-cap company.  — CNBC's Josh Lipton, Ari Levy and Fred Imbert contributed to this report. "
728,2016-01-28T10:55:00-0500,"  The Iowa caucuses are headed to the cloud — but one candidate isn't too happy about it, according to MSNBC.   Microsoft will roll out new apps for each political party to help precincts vet and report their results. But Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' campaign has built its own independent reporting system — one its people said they are ""more sure"" they can trust.   ""It's just a way that our folks can have an app that we trust to get the numbers to us in a timely fashion,"" Pete D'Alessandro, who is running the Iowa portion of Sanders' campaign, told MSNBC. ""I'm always going to be more for sure on the stuff that my people had control over the entire time."" The introduction of the new technology has heightened the drama in a contest already considered the first big hurdle for presidential hopefuls.   Microsoft told MSNBC it created the cloud-based platform, run on Azure, ""solely to administer and facilitate a neutral, accurate, efficient reporting system for the caucuses."" But D'Alessandro questioned ""why they'd want to give something like that away for free,"" in his interview with MSNBC.   Members of the Sanders campaign noted that Microsoft employees have a history of donating to Democratic competitor Hillary Clinton, contributing over $200,000 in her 2008 campaign, according to OpenSecrets.org. But Clinton, too, is preparing a non-Microsoft system, a campaign aide told MSNBC. Microsoft shares ticked higher Thursday ahead of the company's evening earnings release, on a morning when stocks struggled for gains. For more on the story, see the full article at MSNBC.com. "
729,2016-01-28T09:29:14-0500,"  Investors will once again zero in on Microsoft's cloud business when dissecting the tech giant's latest earnings report, but they will also keep an eye out for two other factors: PC sales and expenses.    The company is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results after the bell Thursday, with Wall Street expecting earnings per share of 71 cents on revenue of $25.263 billion, according to a Thompson Reuters consensus estimate.   Last quarter, the company beat estimates on both lines, posting earnings per share of 67 cents on revenue of $21.66 billion.   Microsoft has been transitioning from a primarily PC-based company into a cloud-based one, incorporating products such as Azure and Office 365 into its commercial and enterprise business. PC sales have been slipping across the board for years, and global personal computer shipments fell 10.6 percent in the quarter year over year, according to research firm IDC. Gartner, another research firm, put the decline at 8.3 percent.   Katherine Egbert, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray, said in a Jan. 15 note the weak PC sales number led to her trim her revenue forecast. She also cited a ""faster-than-expected deceleration in global PC shipments"" as a risk.   But she also said Microsoft's cloud business, the world's second largest after Amazon Web Services, could offset PC weakness.    ""The cloud business is sort of becoming a duopoly between AWS and Azure,"" she told CNBC. Egbert estimates that Azure's revenue has grown 125 percent year over year for the December quarter.   ""Azure is their first significant new product,"" she said. ""That's what's exiting about the story.""   However, Keith Weiss, equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC that ""the real concern is that Azure growth is going to come at the expense of (server and tools data center businesses).""  Operating expenditures will also be in focus for Microsoft, as the company attempts to maintain its stellar efficiency, she said, adding that Microsoft's expenses have come in below the low end of their guidance for the past seven quarters.    ""They've done a nice job in opex,"" she said. ""But it's unusual for companies to maintain [strong] opex performance for a long period of time. You're essentially making cuts on top of cuts.""  However, Morgan Stanley's Weiss also said he remains optimistic about Microsoft's earnings. ""This is the year they come back to earnings growth,"" he said. Two of the company's main growth drivers will include its cloud business and operating margin expansion, Weiss said in a Jan. 13 note. — Reuters contributed to this report.  DISCLOSURES: Morgan Stanley makes a market on Microsoft. This story has been updated to reflect a slightly different earnings consensus."

It will run a custom version of Windows 10, Microsoft's new operating system due out in late July. Deliveries will start in September.Despite the hefty price tag, Microsoft is betting that the Surface Hub will appeal to businesses that are used to spending multiples of that amount on conference room facilities.""The theoretical market may be much bigger than the actual market,"" said JP Gownder, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. He said the device likely will not be an instant hit with businesses, but should appeal to companies where collaborative work is important, such as product design or marketing and advertising.  Integrating video-calling and note-taking onto a touch screen, the Surface Hub traces its roots back to products made by Perceptive Pixel, an Oregon-based company Microsoft bought in 2012. Microsoft unveiled a prototype of the new device in January.   It is the latest step in Microsoft's foray into high-tech hardware, starting with the launch of the Surface tablet in 2012 and the purchase of Nokia's handset business last year.   An 84-inch screen version will sell for $20,000. A smaller 55-inch version will sell for $7,000.   The Surface Hub will ""pay for itself and make money"" said Mike Angiulo, who runs Microsoft's devices group.   Angiulo would not reveal how many Surface Hubs are being produced, but said there was a large potential market of millions of conference rooms used by organizations worldwide.   There is no clear market segment for the Surface Hub, which blends elements of video conferencing systems such as those made by Cisco Systems Inc and digital whiteboards made by Panasonic Corp and others. The only directly comparable product is the Mondopad, made by InFocus, which is priced slightly lower than Microsoft's offering.   The larger Surface Hub model, which is just over 4 inches (10 cm) thick and weighs 280 lbs (127 kg), features the biggest single piece of glass for an electronic product in production, Angiulo said. Microsoft makes the devices in Wilsonville, Oregon. "
731,2018-09-20T09:44:00-0400,"(Corrects paragraph five and six to clarify that only one FANG stock will remain in its current sector)NEW YORK, Sept 19 (Reuters) - The most significant changes to Wall Street's broad industry sectors since 1999 will take effect Monday, reclassifying many of the hot growth companies that have been nearly synonymous with the ""tech"" rally that has fueled the stock bull market.While any immediate market impact will be hard to gauge, investors are preparing for volatility in stocks being moved from one industry to another when some investors readjust portfolios.It may affect how mutual fund managers chose stocks and force passively-managed sector exchange traded funds (ETFs) to reallocate billions of dollars.WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES?S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices is reorganizing the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS).It means only one of the so-called FANG stocks - Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc - will remain in their current S&amp;P sector.Facebook and Alphabet will leave tech to join an expanded S&amp;P telecom group, renamed communications services, along with Twitter Inc. They will accompany AT&amp;T Inc, Verizon Communications Inc and CenturyLink Inc, which made up the old telecommunications services sector .Apple Inc, part of the extended FAANG group, will stay in the S&amp;P technology index. It will account for 20 percent of the index's market capitalization, up from 16 percent, once Alphabet and Facebook leave.Other names moving from technology to communications services include PayPal Holdings Inc and videogame makers Electronic Arts Inc and Activision Blizzard Inc .Netflix will move to communications services from the consumer discretionary sector, where it resided alongside Amazon.com, which will remain. Consumer discretionary heavyweights Walt Disney Co and Comcast Corp will also move to the new sector.For a table of affected stocks, see.S&amp;P will make the changes after the close on Friday. MSCI, another index provider, will make the changes in November.WHY IS IT HAPPENING?The changes are meant to reflect how the tech, media and consumer industries have evolved.Maintained by S&amp;P and MSCI since 1999 and widely used by portfolio managers, the taxonomy classifies companies across 11 sectors. The most recently created sector was real estate , split off from financials in 2016. The move allowed an easier route to invest in real estate investment trusts (REITs).""The changes are a step towards acknowledging the convergence of telecommunications, media, and select internet companies and the overlapping services rendered by these companies, within the GICS Structure,"" S&amp;P wrote in a note.UBS in a research paper said telecoms have moved away from voice telephony to focus on fixed and mobile broadband data that is increasingly bundled with video content.""This business model looks a lot like what cable TV companies are offering,"" the investment bank said.Meanwhile, with only three constituents, the old telecom sector was only 2 percent of the S&amp;P 500 ""making it somewhat of an afterthought for many investors.""WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?Stocks being shifted account for about 8 percent of the S&amp;P 500, and S&amp;P sub-indexes will also reflect the changes on Monday. Select Dow Jones indexes will be affected, S&amp;P said.A higher weight in communication services and lower profile in technology will make sector composition more balanced, BMO Capital Markets Chief Investment Strategist Brian Belski wrote.The renamed communications services sector will include three out of four FANGs, even though investors widely view them as the leaders of a tech rally that has powered the stock market in recent years.While the technology sector's importance in the S&amp;P 500 will fall from 26 percent to 20 percent, the changes will also increase the weight of smaller tech companies. After Apple, Microsoft Corp, Visa Inc, Intel Corp and Cisco Systems Inc will round out the S&amp;P tech index's largest five components.HOW ARE INVESTORS POSITIONING?UBS said it did not expect the reclassification to significantly impact the trading of the three sectors. ""It has been well telegraphed by S&amp;P and MSCI and market participants have been preparing for these changes for several months.""Leading fund provider Vanguard Group started transitioning its sector ETFs in the June quarter, while State Street Global Advisors has already launched a new fund tracking communication services.Some active portfolio managers may ignore the new sector classifications. A number of telecommunications funds, for instance, compare their performance to utilities indexes or other benchmarks that will not be affected by the GICS changes.A technology mutual fund could hold Facebook even though it is no longer in the information technology index that the fund is measured against. And some funds use their own customized sector groupings that differ from GICS.""Managers are going to be reluctant followers (of the sector changes) because they're still going to want to choose stocks that fit their criteria,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA.Still, many such rule-based investment managers are constrained by contracts or company policy from deviating too much from specific sectors, according to Rosenbluth.""For some funds, being significantly underweight or overweight a sector that's as sizeable as communication services, or as sizeable as tech or consumer discretionary, is going to be problematic ... so I do think there are going to be stock movements as a result of this.""(Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco and Trevor Hunnicutt in New York Editing by Nick Zieminski)"
732,2018-12-27T09:00:51-0500,"The last time Amazon's stock had a quarter this bad the company had only been selling the Kindle for a year.Amazon is just one of many tech stocks to get hit hard in the fourth-quarter market rout.Even after Wednesday's rally, the shopping season has been a disaster for Amazon investors.Since the company's market capitalization briefly topped $1 trillion in September, the stock has been in free fall, losing 27 percent of its value in the last three months and putting it on pace for its worst quarter since the recession of 2008.It's not a company-specific story. The stock market is tanking on concern about rising interest rates, slowing global growth and political instability. Tech is leading the downturn. Apple has plunged 30 percent this quarter and Microsoft has dropped 12 percent.Facebook has slumped 18 percent, but for good reason. The social network has been bombarded by a constant stream of negative headlines related to the manipulation of its platform by foreign actors and the company's inability or unwillingness to adequately protect user data.Amazon is facing some challenges of its own. In the most recent quarter, the company's cloud computing unit didn't grow as fast as analysts had predicted, and overall revenue fell short of expectations. Fourth-quarter revenue guidance was also disappointing.The stock bounced back with the rest of the market on Wednesday, rising more than 9 percent to $1,470.90. Amazon didn't respond to a request for comment.Europe may be dragging Amazon down, analysts from Baird wrote in a note to clients last week. British online retail group IMRG reported the slowest annual revenue growth in November since 2011, the analysts said. They also cited ""weaker-than-expected revenue outlooks"" from U.K. retailers ASOS and Sports Direct and Visa's report on a decline in consumer spending there, ""reflecting uncertainty around Brexit.""WATCH: Brexit explained: The UK's big gambleThe last time Amazon suffered a more dramatic loss was the fourth quarter of 2008, when the company lost 30 percent of its value. The only quarters with bigger drops were during the dot-com collapse of 2000 and 2001, when Amazon suffered declines of 33 percent or more four times, according to FactSet.Amazon was hardly even the same company then. Amazon Web Services wasn't launched until 2006 and the Kindle e-reader came out a year later. Amazon Prime was introduced 2005. In 2001, Amazon had fewer than 7,800 employees, a number that climbed to 20,700 by the end of 2008. Today, the company employs 566,000 people.Even after the stock's plunge, it's up 245-fold from 2001 and 29-fold from the end of 2008.WATCH: Remember when Amazon's stock tanked 90%? Long-term investors still got richQuarterly revenue now exceeds $56 billion, while 17 years ago it was $700 million. Most of the revenue then came from sales of books, music and DVDs.During 2018, we've grown accustomed to launches of Alexa-powered devices, the opening of cashierless stores and the release of new movies produced by Amazon Studios. In 2001, the company launched an online computer store.""With the latest desktops and notebooks from leading brands like Apple, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Toshiba, the new store offers computer solutions for everyone from small-business owners, families and college students to gamers, road warriors, graphics enthusiasts, technophiles and others,"" Amazon said in a press release on Aug. 29, 2001.Amazon would soon introduce a feature that let users ""look inside"" a digital book on its website, flipping through a few pages.While the dot-bomb era was devastating to Amazon shareholders, the company was ultimately one of the few survivors, leaving it in position to win business as its counterparts withered. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the company's stock jumped 81 percent and it turned a profit for the first time. Bezos continued to expand and a year later started selling clothes in partnership with companies like Eddie Bauer and Gap.Similarly, the first quarter of 2009 saw the stock pop 43 percent, rebounding from the prior quarter. During that period, the company introduced Kindle for the iPhone and iPod touch, and later that year bought Zappos.In other words, Amazon has learned how to weather a downturn.WATCH: Growth rates are slowing for tech sector, says Gene Munster"
733,2018-12-19T10:02:33-0500,"Digital assistants with artificial intelligence, including Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, Google Assistant and Microsoft Cortana, are in the early days of being inserted into office life.AI will be able to monitor employees' every word, including for tone and sentiment, as well as monitor employees vital health stats.Backers say the productivity gains will benefit employers and workers who will lead better, lower-stress lives, but there is no regulation to oversee the constant monitoring of employees by AI in the office.Artificial intelligence has thoroughly penetrated home life through virtual assistants such as Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. Now it is making inroads into the office market, with companies of all sizes and across industries, from finance to natural resource companies and tech firms, testing AI across their workforces.Experts say virtual assistants have the potential to dramatically alter the lives of white-collar workers, providing employers with unimaginable levels of data that can be analyzed to improve decision-making. But to do so, these AI technologies — sitting on desks and in conference rooms — will be monitoring every word employees speak, along with their tone.""The amount of data being collected about every individual, every moment of the day, will explode as AI-enabled virtual assistants become ubiquitous,"" said Dr. Louis Rosenberg, CEO and chief scientist at the technology company Unanimous AI. ""These tools will not just be documenting what we say and what we type, but will be observing our reactions, predicting our next steps and tracking the accuracy of their forecasts, even documenting our moods.""Today most AI systems can listen and respond to verbal commands, but their ability to interpret nonverbal cues, such as pitch, tone, eye movement, hand gestures and how you stand is developing rapidly, said Josh Feast, CEO and co-founder of Cogito, a company that uses AI to help sales and service professionals. ""The way we interact with (virtual assistants) will evolve to resemble actual human-to-human interactions,"" he said. ""Everyone in an office will effectively have a personal-behavior assistant. ""Technology will be much more pervasive in the office.""Cogito's AI is currently being used by health care, banking and insurance companies to help agents. The system displays visual cues to call-center agents to alert them if they are interrupting or speaking too quickly. It will also suggest ways to respond appropriately if the customer is getting emotional and needs empathy. Apple — which declined to comment — teamed up with Salesforce to offer Siri to corporate customers in September.As the AI moves beyond chatbots for the customer service department and is inserted into all walks of office life, AI will be monitoring many employees in real-time and word by word. Even employees' health. Feast said the technology will monitor heart rate, breathing and blood pressure, along with verbal and nonverbal cues to determine the physical and emotional state of users and then coach them to improve behavior.""Unless regulations prevent it, AI-enabled virtual assistants will become the eyes and ears of HR departments, disseminating data on the work habits and enthusiasm of employees,"" Rosenberg said. AI will be able to listen in on meetings and take notes, assess who's participating and document the tone — positive or negative — used by speakers. ""I would hope regulations require companies to inform people when an AI is listening to a meeting and tracking participation.""Amazon — which did not respond to multiple requests for comment — has an Alexa for Business unit, which currently touts its use as a conference-call technology replacement, for use at an employee's desk and even at home. A recent blog post from the Alexa for Business team discussed new ""usage metrics across all shared devices managed by Alexa for Business, as well as private skill usage across users and devices.""On its website, Alexa for Business lists clients across a range of industries — Conde Nast, GE, Fender and Brooks Brothers are among customers referenced.Professional organizations are discussing standards that can be applied. One example of this is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a global technical professional organization. Its Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems seeks to encourage AI developers to prioritize ethical considerations, including how employers collect, store, use and share employee data.But ""it's not clear that institutions with the power to regulate yet appreciate the possible magnitude of the problem,"" Rosenberg said.While companies' current ability to monitor employees' keystrokes represents a privacy concern, Rosenberg sees greater threats coming. Keystrokes only capture words, whereas AI devices capture inflection and emotion, which means the software can determine the sentiment behind the words.""Listening in on verbal conversations is a substantial privacy issue. It's even worse than keystrokes because it's ubiquitous, continuous, and it's not just from the one person typing but from everyone in earshot."" He added, ""Without regulation ... the AI will report on you to your company — not just what you said, but how you said it.""Stephen Wakeling, CEO and co-founder of Phobio, a software development company, agreed that AI will be capable of listening in on many in-office conversations, but he takes a brighter view of the outcome. The ability to collect and analyze data points from these conversations will be of great use to companies and employees. ""There's a big vault of thought that executives don't have access to right now,"" he said. ""Robots can collect it, remove identifiers and look for trends.""Wakeling said employers' fear of litigation should go a long way to prevent privacy abuse. He also sees regulation stepping up. ""I would imagine that as rights-to-privacy regulation evolves, AI would eventually allow employers to mine communications by employees at work or on company-owned platforms but protect the anonymity of employees,"" he said. ""Yes, Big Brother is watching, but Big Brother that anonymizes data is helpful, not scary,"" Wakeling said.AI can be used to improve employee morale and productivity by better predicting which positions and shift times are most suitable for specific employees. ""People aren't effective if they're in a job that doesn't suit them, or if they're lonely and isolated at work. Happy people perform better,"" Wakeling said.AI can also be used to keep far-flung employees connected. As telecommuting and the gig economy grow, digital assistants could help employers keep tabs on workers. ""It will be much easier to measure all team-member effectiveness,"" Wakeling said. The positive view of all employee hours and productivity being tracked by AI is that companies will be able to better train and support remote workers.Wakeling said that even if modifying the hours of individual employees yields small increases in productivity, the cumulative difference could be substantial. ""When Google began to measure the performance difference between good and bad managers, the difference was almost imperceptible, but it turned out to be an impactful difference between keeping good engineers and losing them,"" he said. ""In a more competitive human workforce, lots of other industries will face the same challenges.""Alphabet, Google's parent company, declined to comment.Employee effectiveness and happiness already can be gauged directly through surveying, but also indirectly by having AI conduct sentiment analysis.Sentiment analysis is a process currently used by companies to scan social media and news sites for mention of a company and determine the extent to which it is positive or negative, said Noah Waisberg, co-founder and CEO of AI software firm Kira Systems, which is being used in the legal profession for document review that in the past would have consumed the lives of law firm associates. It would not be a huge technical leap to have these systems listen in on conversations, phone calls, email and text, he said. The data collected could then be analyzed to determine morale if a new corporate policy is popular with staff or, for instance, if a change to the 401(k) plan was well received.Svetlana Sicular, a vice president and AI analyst at the research firm Gartner, said another way the machines will be able to analyze the data they collect is called topic modeling — text is mined for patterns and language to identify the subject matter being discussed. But she added that the technology still has a ways to go, since many systems still cannot understand those speaking languages other than English.""The interactions with AI become another data stream that can be harvested and learned from,"" said Tom Hoglund, vice president in Avanade's Modern Workplace Center of Excellence, which has a joint venture with Microsoft and Accenture for the digital transformation of the workplace. ""Virtual assistants will be independent of the channel used to interact with them. For example, virtual assistants should use the same logic and machine learning to interact with users via audio, text chat, email or by observing activity on your computer, combining that with attributes it knows about you and proactively offering up help even before you ask for it.""Hoglund said that outside of call centers, companies typically begin using AI for internal employee-support functions.Avanade helped a large mining company roll out new Microsoft Office 365 technology to its 60,000 employees. Knowing that internal IT support calls would spike with so many end users experiencing a new system, the client had Avanade create an AI-powered bot to answer questions about the new technology and resolve problems without human intervention.""The AI was able to handle over 20 percent of the incidents that arose and 80 percent of the service requests,"" he said. ""We have created a similar bot for our internal use at Avanade, which covers much more than just IT support and have found that it is helping with employee engagement as they get their questions answered at any time of day and not just when the IT, HR or other departments are open.""Within a few years humans and AI will become one collaborative intelligence team, said Dr. Cheemin Bo-Linn, co-chair of Women Corporate Directors of Silicon Valley and CEO and president of Peritus Partners, an analytics-based marketing IT consultancy. ""Our DNA programs us to want to put people on problems. We need to widen our focus and accept that machines are better at some things.""A Microsoft spokeswoman said digital assistants for consumers and enterprise use are still in the early stages of innovation and development, and the technology will continue to evolve and get better over time.""We see great value and promise for digital assistants in the workplace, and that is what drives a lot of our product decisions and vision for Cortana,"" she said. The spokeswoman said imagine a scenario where a client is meeting with a sales team to discuss how to make sure they finish strong that quarter. Cortana can provide insights into deals that are at risk and then reach out to a nearby human expert with the expertise to help.""At the start of the 20th century, silent black-and-white filmmaking was cutting-edge,"" Gartner's Sicular said. ""Those involved in its earliest days could not have imagined that film would have sound and color in the 1930s. The future of AI will be different than what we can imagine now, but sound and color are coming.""Those sounds and colors hopefully will not make it to the office bathroom stall, but watch out for your desk and conference-room console.—By Joe D'Allegro, special to CNBC.com"

In Monday's trading session, the first trading session for mainland China investors since the two countries imposed additional tariffs on each other's imports, both Chinese stocks and the yuan slid.The dollar rose slightly in response to the turmoil in Chinese markets.

736,2015-12-28T21:29:48-0500,"  Air pollution in China could be big business.   Two of the world's largest technology firms, IBM and Microsoft, are vying to tap the nascent, fast-growing market for forecasting air quality in the world's top carbon emitters.   Bouts of acrid smog enveloping Beijing prompted authorities in the Chinese capital to declare two unprecedented ""red alerts"" this month - a warning to the city's 22 million inhabitants that heavy pollution is expected for more than three days.   Such alerts rely on advances in pollution forecasting, increasingly important for Communist Party leaders as they seek improvements in monitoring and managing the country's notorious smog in response to growing public awareness.   Official interest has also been boosted by China's preparations to host the Winter Olympics - Beijing's smog is worse in the colder months - in 2022.   ""There is increasing attention to the air quality forecast service,"" said Yu Zheng, a researcher at Microsoft. ""More and more people care about this information technology.""   A rudimentary forecast was pioneered by Dustin Grzesik, a U.S. geochemist and former Beijing resident who created Banshirne.com, a free website and smartphone app, in 2013 to predict clean air days using publicly available weather data on wind patterns.  ""If you can predict the weather, it only takes a few more variables to predict air quality,"" said Robert Rohde of Berkeley Earth, a U.S.-based non-profit that maps China's real-time air pollution. ""Most of the time pollutant emissions don't vary very rapidly.""   Now, advances in ""cognitive computing"" - machines programed to improve modeling on their own - allow more sophisticated forecasting software to provide predictions for the air quality index up to 10 days in advance using data on weather, traffic and land use, as well as real-time pollution levels from government monitoring stations and even social media posts. Business of smog  Both Microsoft and IBM secured their first government clients last year after developing their respective pollution forecasting technologies at their China-based research labs.   Chinese authorities only began releasing real-time levels of PM2.5 - airborne particulate matter under 2.5 microns in diameter that can penetrate deep into the lungs - in 2012, after denouncing the U.S. embassy for publishing its own real-time monitoring data on Twitter.   IBM's first client was the city of Beijing's environmental protection bureau, which bases its color-coded pollution alerts on the technology.   The company launched a ""Joint Environmental Innovation Center"" - staffed by government and IBM scientists - with the bureau earlier in December, allowing officials to better model pollution reduction scenarios during the worst episodes.   Still the municipal government only makes public a 24-hour forecast on its website, meaning residents aren't able to see for themselves when a ""red alert"" may be due.   The environmental bureau's monitoring center did not respond to a request for comment.   IBM has also signed a deal with Zhangjiakou, which will jointly host the 2022 Winter Olympics alongside Beijing, to do forward planning and scenario modeling ahead of the games.   For its part, Microsoft has signed up China's environment ministry, and the environmental protection bureaus in Fujian province and Chengdu, the capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan.   Outside China, IBM has also signed deals for air quality modeling with Delhi, one of the world's most polluted cities, and Johannesburg.   ""We should be able to use the same base system and do air quality forecasting in different parts of the world,"" said Brad Gammons, the business leader behind the IBM initiative, which the company calls 'Green Horizons'.   ""With the machine-based learning we can do it very quickly.""   The two tech rivals aren't just competing over government clients. Business clients - in particular renewable power generation companies - are another target, along with consumers. Already more than 30 solar farms in China are using IBM's forecasting technology, which can also help predict the availability of sunlight.   Microsoft has created a website called Urban Air and a smartphone app with a 48-hour forecast, while the China Open tennis tournament put IBM pollution forecasts for parks across Beijing on its public WeChat social messaging account.   But there are still kinks to work out.   The latest version of Microsoft's iPhone app lacked the forecasting function advertised, which the company blamed on a bug, while during a recent ""red alert,"" when the air was considered hazardous and schools were shut, the China Open IBM-based forecast recommended ""light exercise"".

737,2015-12-31T03:01:58-0500," Microsoft said on Wednesday it will begin warning users of its consumer services including Outlook.com email when the company suspects that a government has been trying to hack into their accounts.   The policy change comes nine days after Reuters asked the company why it had decided not tell victims of a hacking campaign, discovered in 2011, that had targeted international leaders of China's Tibetan and Uighur minorities in particular.   According to two former employees of Microsoft, the company's own experts had concluded several years ago that Chinese authorities had been behind the campaign but the company did not pass on that information to users of its Hotmail service, which is now called Outlook.com. In its statement, Microsoft said neither it nor the U.S. government could pinpoint the sources of the hacking attacks and that they didn't come from a single country.  The policy shift at the world's largest software company follows similar moves since October by Internet giants Facebook Inc, Twitter Inc and most recently Yahoo Inc.   Google Inc pioneered the practice in 2012 and said it now alerts tens of thousands of users every few months.   For two years, Microsoft has offered alerts about potential security breaches without specifying the likely suspect.  In a statement to Reuters, Microsoft said: ""As the threat landscape has evolved our approach has too, and we'll now go beyond notification and guidance to specify if we reasonably believe the attacker is 'state-sponsored'.""   In a blog post published late Wednesday, Microsoft said: ""We're taking this additional step of specifically letting you know if we have evidence that the attacker may be 'state-sponsored' because it is likely that the attack could be more sophisticated or more sustained than attacks from cybercriminals and others. (here)  The Hotmail attacks targeted diplomats, media workers, human rights lawyers, and others in sensitive positions inside China, according to the former employees.   Microsoft had told the targets to reset their passwords but did not tell them that they had been hacked. Five victims interviewed by Reuters said they had not taken the password reset as an indication of hacking.   Online free-speech activists and security experts have long called for more direct warnings, saying that they prompt behavioral changes from email users. "
738,2015-12-23T10:34:24-0500," It's been one hell of a year for Microsoft. The U.S. technology company's share price is up nearly 20 percent year-to-date with analysts saying the firm has transformed itself from a ""sleeping giant"" into a technology leader.   So what has Microsoft done this year to excite investors and change its image?    Chief executive, Satya Nadella, has made cloud computing a clear focus through 2015, with Microsoft's Azure and Office 365 products. The business one of the company's fastest-growing areas, with revenues up 8 percent to $5.9 billion in the quarter ending September 30.   Microsoft's success in the cloud pushed Goldman Sachs to raise its price target for the stock to $57 from $45 earlier this month and upgrade it to ""neutral"" from ""sell.""    ""The company has been successfully transitioning its Office-installed base to Office 365, is the no. 2 leader in cloud services behind Amazon Web Services and has shown strong operating expense discipline and capital allocation,"" Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note.   While Microsoft is behind Amazon's cloud division, analysts are bullish on the potential for the Redmond, WA-based company to be a big player in 2016.    ""We continue to believe 2016 will be a '206 area code street battle for the cloud,' with Microsoft firmly best positioned as the vendor to compete with AWS on the enterprise cloud front for years to come,"" FBR Capital Markets wrote in a note this week.    After widespread criticism of Window 8, Microsoft's new Windows 10 operating system (OS) impressed analysts.    Key features include ""Universal Apps,"" which allows developers to create one app and get it to run across different devices without the need to tinker the code much. There's also a new web browser called Edge, plus Microsoft's version of Siri — called Cortana — is now available on desktop.   In October, the company said that Windows 10 had been installed on more than 110 million devices since its launch on July 29.    It's been a rocky year for mobile for Microsoft. Windows Phone is forecast to hold just 2.2 percent of the overall smartphone market this year, according to IDC, a market research company.    Microsoft has decided to slash 18,000 jobs, with many of the layoffs coming from the handset division recently acquired from Nokia.    The company has also released the Lumia 950 and 950 XL flagship phones, which met with limited success.    ""Microsoft is accustomed to being the dominant player in PC and suddenly in 2015, they have realized they have lost in smartphones and they have pivoted their strategy dramatically,"" Ian Fogg, head of mobile at IHS, told CNBC.    The new strategy has seen Microsoft open its once-closed software such as Office to iPhone and Android users, realizing that it can win by getting its software onto the mass of devices, rather than trying to compete on hardware market share.   One of the most surprising hardware releases this year was HoloLens, Microsoft's augmented reality headset, which projects holographs onto the real world.    While still in its early stages, Microsoft announced plans to send HoloLens into space to help astronauts at the International Space Station. It also signed a deal with Volvo Cars to use the headset in its showroom.   The device's launch was important as it showed Microsoft is still innovative, analysts said.   ""It's important as brand positioning to show Microsoft isn't a sleeping giant but is a company that is tech leader that can be spoken about in the same breath as Apple, Google and Facebook,"" Fogg said."

740,2018-09-17T18:38:00-0400,"(Adds analyst's comments, forecast)Sept 17 (Reuters) - Oracle Corp on Monday reported first-quarter revenue that narrowly missed analysts' estimates, suggesting that the business software maker was struggling to make inroads in the highly competitive cloud computing market.Shares of Oracle fell 4 percent to $47.30 in extended trading as the company's biggest unit, which houses its cloud services business, also reported disappointing sales.Revenue in its cloud services and license support business rose 3.2 percent to $6.61 billion, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $6.71 billion, with the co-Chief Executive Officer Safra Katz attributing the miss to a strong dollar.Oracle is a late entrant to the cloud business and has been playing catch up with rivals, including Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Salesforce.com Inc.In its efforts to take a bigger share of the cloud computing market, the company said earlier this year that it would quadruple the number of its largest data centers.However, the company is yet to present a credible challenge to the dominant players in the industry.Oracle stopped breaking out its cloud computing numbers in the fourth quarter, a move that drew criticism from analysts and investors, who said it gave little insight into the performance of its key business.""We want to compare Oracle's cloud business to other cloud leaders that recently reported strong cloud growth ... but we cannot due to the lack of specific details,"" said Daniel Morgan, senior portfolio manager of Synovus Trust Co, which holds Oracle shares.""That's actually the nitty gritty why everyone is frustrated and the stock is down.""For the second quarter, the company said it expected revenue to be flat to up 2 percent and earnings of 78 to 80 cents per share, the mid-point of which was in line with analysts' estimates.Net income rose to $2.27 billion, or 57 cents per share, in the reported quarter ended Aug. 31 from $2.14 billion, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 71 cents per share, while total revenue rose 1 percent to $9.19 billion.Analysts on average were expecting an adjusted profit of 69 cents per share on revenue of $9.28 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

741,2015-12-17T05:31:51-0500,"  Microsoft has struck a deal with a Chinese technology company to sell its new Windows 10 operating system to the country's civil service, the company said late on Wednesday.    The new joint venture, which is subject to regulatory approval in China and is provisionally called C&amp;M Information Technologies, will see Microsoft and its partner China Electronics Technology Group (CETC), license, deploy, manage and optimize Windows 10 for China's government agencies and state owned enterprises. The joint venture will provide support and services for the customers.  C&amp;M Information Technologies will act as the ""exclusive licensor"" of Windows 10 and is working on a modified version of Windows 10 for the Chinese government. It will also provide support to the government customers.   The move comes as Microsoft looks to improve its image in the world's second-largest economy. U.S. companies in China received a bad reputation after National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden alleged that foreign products were being used for spying. And last year, China's antitrust regulator conducted new raids on Microsoft's offices in China.    ""We'll continue to keep Windows 10 secure and sustain our strong privacy standards, while recognizing that public sector solutions may differ from technology offered to private sector enterprises and consumers around the world,"" Yusuf Mehdi, corporate vice president of the Windows and Devices Group at Microsoft said in a blog post.    Microsoft has also been making a broader push into the consumer sector in China in order to get legitimate versions of Windows to users in a market that is dominated by piracy. In September, it announced a partnership with China's largest search engine Baidu to allow the service's customers to upgrade to Windows 10. It signed similar deals earlier this year with Lenovo, Tencent and Qihu 360. "
742,2015-11-20T02:39:19-0500,"Volvo has struck a deal with Microsoft that will see the two companies work together in developing driverless vehicle and giving potential car buyers an interactive shopping experience using the U.S. technology giant's HoloLens headset. The two firms announced on Friday that the main focus of the partnership will be to develop autonomous cars, the use of data to create ""meaningful services"", machine learning and how to modernize the car buying process.""Technology will transform when it comes to autonomous cars, connectivity and the car buying process. We believe this will happen it's naturally the tech and automotive industry comes closer to explore this together,"" Björn Annwall, senior vice president of marketing, sales and service at Volvo, which is owned by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, told CNBC by phone. ""We are exploring a number of different collaborations,"" Annwall added saying that exact details of what the partnership would entail would not be released yet. The move highlights the trend for technology companies to jump into the autos space. Last month, South Korea electronics giant LG announced that it would be providing key components for General Motors' upcoming Chevrolet Bolt electric car. At the same time, Google is testing driverless cars while speculation is rife that Apple will also come to market with its own vehicle.   Like many auto companies, Volvo is keen to develop autonomous vehicles. This week, the automaker unveiled Concept 26, a model of a driverless car's interior.  ""Autonomous driving is at the center of Volvo' strategy and future,"" Annwall said.   ""The Concept 26 is a concept of what we view the interior will look like quite soon as we have made the design compatible with our cars.""   But the marketing executive could not say how Microsoft and Volvo would work together in this area.    Data and so-called machine learning – where a computer can learn to adapt and make decisions based on vast amounts of data – is another area the two firms are hoping to collaborate on. Anwall said that modern cars are equipped with vast amounts of sensors which could be used to detect road conditions, such as an icy patch, and send that information to drivers who are behind to warn them, for example.  While details were scarce on many areas, one feature outlines by the firms was how HoloLens -- Microsoft's augmented reality headset which projects 3-D images on to real objects  -- could be used to help customers buy cars.    Annwall explained that customers who come into a Volvo showroom can use HoloLens to view the car in 3D, change colors and see how features work. A customer could overlay new colors over a Volvo car in a showroom, for example.   ""Here you will get full scale and can look up to it can touch it, get into it and get that mix of digital and feel and touch of physical world that we know customers will appreciate,"" Anwall told CNBC.

743,2018-12-21T12:34:21-0500,"Apple Siri has gotten smarter over the last 9 months according to data from Loup Ventures.Apple has continued to make investments in AI, hiring an exec away from Google.Siri has a perception problem, however, lots of people think it's much dumber than Alexa and Google Assistant.Apple's Siri has struggled to seem as smart as voice assistants from Amazon and Google, but new data from Loup Ventures' Gene Munster and Will Thompson suggests that Siri has made large improvements over the last six months.Munster and Thompson found that Siri correctly answered 74.6 percent of the 800 questions asked during their tests. That was better than Amazon Alexa (72.5 percent) and Microsoft Cortana (63.4 percent), but still behind Google Assistant (87.9 percent).Loup Ventures measured the voice assistants by asking questions across four categories including local information, commerce, navigation and general information. They also measured correct responses to commands. Siri scored lowest of the bunch in the ""information"" category -- meaning it wasn't able to answer general questions as correctly, such as ""Who do the Twins play tonight?"" That might explain why Siri is perceived as dumber than the other voice assistants.""Over a 12-month period, Google Home improved by 7 percentage points, Echo by 9 points, Siri (9-month) by 22 points, and Cortana by 7 points in terms of questions answered correctly,"" Loup Ventures said in its report.Apple has continued to put a focus on increasing its ability to compete in AI against Google, Amazon and Microsoft. In April, it hired AI exec John Giannandrea from Google, and earlier this week promoted him to Apple's executive team, reporting directly to Tim Cook. Giannandrea might very well help Apple surpass Google.If that happens, Apple will need to change the perception we have about Siri and find a way to promote that it's getting much smarter. Even now, as the Loup Ventures report suggests, Siri isn't as dumb as people might think, it's just not as good at answering general questions.Read more on Loup Ventures.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."
744,2018-09-14T11:06:00-0400,"NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - U.S. technology and consumer discretionary stocks have been insulated from global trade tensions, but if another round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods goes into effect, even those high-flying sectors could come down to earth.The United States and China have already imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of each other's goods. The White House has proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports, including furniture, handbags and some computer parts.U.S. President Donald Trump has said he is prepared to move forward with levies on an additional $267 billion - in essence, all Chinese imports into the United States.The inclusion of consumer goods is a shift from previous rounds of U.S. tariffs, which have primarily hit the industrial sector. Shares of companies such as Boeing Co and Caterpillar Inc have risen and fallen in tandem with trade sentiment.On Wednesday, the Trump administration said that it invited Chinese officials to restart trade talks, which has been welcomed by Beijing. U.S. stocks have perked up on the news, but that optimism could be fleeting.""Investors in general are too predisposed to react too positively to any signs of improvement in the situation,"" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco in New York. ""I don't expect the (Trump) administration to back down.""Companies in the tech and consumer discretionary sectors have begun sounding alarm bells. A broad array of U.S. industry groups, representing companies such as Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc, Walmart Inc and Mattel Inc , has voiced opposition to the new tariffs.Even Apple Inc, whose stock has contributed heavily to the S&amp;P 500's gains, has warned that the proposed tariffs would affect several of its products, including the Apple Watch and AirPods headphones, though it did not mention the iPhone.In part because of trade issues, shares of tech companies have gotten off to a rocky start in September. As of Thursday's close, the S&amp;P 500 tech sector had fallen 1.2 percent this month, versus a 0.1 percent rise for the S&amp;P 500 as a whole. S&amp;P 500 consumer discretionary stocks had risen 0.2 percent, less than the 2 percent advance in industrial stocks.""The next round of escalation really does impact the leadership of the market,"" said Lisa Shalett, head of investment and portfolio strategies at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management.In anticipation of heightened trade tensions, companies have built up inventory, which could have an adverse effect on supply chains later on, Shalett said. Inventory pile-ups have already pushed down pricing in the semiconductor industry. The Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index had fallen 2.8 percent in September as of Thursday's close.Consumer-oriented companies face a catch-22 in their response to tariffs. Those that compete on price, such as Walmart, will likely have to absorb the cost of levies, which will cut into their margins. But companies that pass costs onto consumers, as Apple has indicated it will do, risk dampening demand for their products.Invesco's Hooper pointed to washing machines as an example. Tariffs on steel and aluminum caused Whirlpool Corp to raise prices on its appliances, and its second-quarter earnings slumped as a result.To be sure, consumer electronics are flashier products than a washer-dryer set. And U.S. tech companies can skirt some tariffs by shipping Chinese-made parts directly to other countries for assembly and then importing the finished items into the United States, said Scott Yuschak, equity strategy analyst at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. The list of targeted items in the next round of tariffs excludes cell phones, for instance.With such mitigating factors, many investors are reluctant to make sweeping changes to their portfolios, though Morgan Stanley's Shalett has recommended a rotation into defensive sectors.Many are likely waiting for third-quarter earnings for more details on the impact of trade, said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston.But further signs of escalation in the U.S.-China trade war could quickly raise the stakes for the S&amp;P's leading sectors. The final round of levies would include consumer electronic products imported from China. Some market watchers fear that China, which cannot match the United States in tit-for-tat tariffs, would respond by restricting U.S. companies' ability to sell products in the country.""If you look at the broad base of technology, there isn't much impact at this point,"" said Daniel Morgan, portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta. ""But if you include the iPhone into tariffs, then that changes the whole game."" (Reporting by April Joyner; Editing by Alden Bentley and Phil Berlowitz)"

Suddenly, companies that have been remarkably consistent hit speed bumps and created what Jim Cramer described as a ""bizarre earnings season.""   ""What we really have in each case is a set of expectations created by stocks that have been moving up consistently —expectations that were too much for each of these companies' managements to muster,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.  Google-owner Alphabet, Visa, Microsoft and Starbucks all reported earnings Thursday, and in each case the market pronounced the quarters subpar and sent the stocks tumbling after hours.   Still, Cramer noted that each of those stocks had a magnificent run.

Therefore, Cramer interpreted the quarter as a continued transformation. Yet, the company's numbers weren't good enough to please investors who rang the register.   The only problematic miss, in Cramer's perspective, came from Alphabet, which simply failed to deliver on both the top and bottom line. After a series of better-than-expected earnings and sales that fueled the stock higher, its 17 percent top-line growth just wasn't enough.   ""The darned thing was priced for perfection, and we didn't get it. So, it is getting clobbered,"" Cramer said.

""Halo 5"" is exclusive to Microsoft's Xbox console platform, making it a key weapon in Xbox's battle with Sony's PlayStation. In fact, with the Xbox One lagging rival PlayStation 4, the appeal of ""Halo"" is considered a key way to help Microsoft recoup its investment in the gaming platform.

754,2015-10-23T13:02:01-0400,"  With technology stocks soaring off earnings beats, analysts broke down what's working — and what's not — in the sector.    ""The earnings yesterday showed that money is in the cloud, and Amazon, Microsoft and Google showed you the money,"" Venky Ganesan, Menlo Ventures' managing director, told CNBC. ""Paradoxically, in the same week, we have EMC and Dell merging, and IBM coming out with bad earnings. So you can see we know the …. haves and the have-nots in the big tech world.""    While companies like Microsoft and Amazon are widening their lead in cloud computing over competitors such as HP, it's still up for debate whether bets on core search will pan out for Google's parent company, Alphabet, analysts said.   All three stock markets opened higher Friday, buoyed in part to an earnings sweep from Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft. That's after other tech companies such as IBM and Yahoo got slammed in earnings earlier in the season.   The trio of stocks were up more than 7 percent Friday morning, on a day when the markets rallied between 1 and 2 percent. Alphabet beat estimates by 14 cents Thursday night, while Amazon posted earnings per share of 17 cents — blowing away the 13-cent loss expected by Wall Street.  Microsoft posted a beat on both earnings and estimates and accounted for 31 points of the Dow's gains.   Read More How to trade Amazon, Microsoft &amp; Alphabet earnings   So what did Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet do right?     Microsoft saw a boost from Windows 10 adoption and commercial cloud computing, while Amazon continued to post profits on the back of Amazon Web Services (AWS). Under a new reporting structure, Google's parent company Alphabet highlighted mobile search and return to shareholders.   ""AWS has hit a tipping point, and because they hit a tipping point, Jeff [Bezos] has decided to break it down and show you the … revenue. The Street is looking at that and realizing that this is a game changer,"" Ganesan said.     Amazon has managed to shake its reputation for posting losses by posting yet another profitable quarter — a trend that could continue, with one major caveat, Mark Mahaney, internet analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told CNBC on Friday.    ""We think they're about to launch a major investment cycle into Asia,"" Mahaney said. ""That could depress earnings. But I think what the market will do is take a 'sum-of-the-parts' approach on this, and look at the ramping profitability in North American retail, and the ramping profitability in AWS, and the market will look through that. But that's the major investment cycle to worry about.""   Read More Stocks rally on PBOC, tech earnings; Microsoft up 10%   Ben Schachter, analyst at Macquarie Capital also predicted the upward trend would continue for Amazon, noting that competitors such as eBay and Walmart have not posed a ""meaningful competitive response"" to premium service Prime in a Friday research note.    Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, echoed Schacter's sentiments.    ""If you look at Amazon, they grew their units at 26 percent last quarter. Ebay grew their GMV at 6 percent,"" he told CNBC. Munster added that unit-growth is ""the real story"" — something investors should focus on as opposed to margin growth.""The sustainability of commerce is probably a bigger, longer term theme,"" Munster said.   ""Looking at the e-commerce business … growth rate this quarter, the fact that it re-accelerated, considering that they are already by far one the largest market share companies in the world, tells you that business should be worth a lot more,"" Youssef Squali, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said. ""The unfair competitive advantage that Amazon has that Wal-Mart doesn't have, that Target doesn't have, and that eBay doesn't have is the fact that AWS is highly profitable… . They can continue to subsidize the e-commerce business, and really undercut anybody and everybody in terms of pricing.""    Though Schachter wrote that the sustainability of AWS is ""unclear,"" the remote computing service seems to be unstoppable in the near term.    ""AWS may be the single-most dominant trend in tech today,"" Mahaney said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" ""It's a very large market. This company's got eight times the share of its closest competitor. There's only really one big horse in this race, and it's a business that's a commodity business, so whoever has the most scale has the lowest costs, can charge the lowest prices, can gain the most market share.""    Munster said on Friday's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report"" that he raised his price target on Amazon to a street-high of $800 because of Amazon's large gains in ""the secular growth theme.""  ""An elementary student could tell you this, but it's still something that is an investable theme so we're very much on board with owning Amazon,"" he said.  However, this isn't without caution.   ""You gotta think about traditional retailers. They're the ones feeling the most pressure right now and they're not going to give up,"" Munster warned. ""So that could force Amazon into more of an investment phase and could cause investors confidence in the margin expansion to relapse. That's probably the biggest risk that' more near term.""   Alphabet made strides in shareholder transparency in its first report under a new structure Thursday, emphasizing a focus on its constituents with a stock buyback program, Schachter wrote.    ""The surprise last night was on mobile, when they [Alphabet] said that mobile now accounts for more than 50 percent of queries,"" Squali said. ""It kind of reminds me a little bit of Facebook three years ago, when everybody was basically saying that Facebook has a mobile problem, and they turned it into a huge opportunity. I think you're going to see the same thing with Google right now.""    Core search, Google's most well-known product, was particularly illuminated in the report.    ""The business fundamentals seem to indicate that concerns about core search may be exaggerated,"" Schachter wrote.   Read More GOOG, AMZN post earnings wins, other techs struggle   ""The market's been wrong on core search,"" Mahaney said. ""The market's assumed that core search is heading toward single-digit growth, and therefore this company doesn't deserve a large growth multiple.""   Mahaney believes the stock is undervalued, though he said he felt there was still more work to be done to disclose the impact of YouTube and advertising prices on the business.    ""This is extremely stable revenue growth,"" Mahaney said. ""I think that's something that's misunderstood about Google. This is now 11 straight quarters where the company's been able to grow its core advertising business somewhere between 16 and 21 percent. It's an accelerating growth story with what we think are stable to expanding margins in the core business. This stock should trade at a higher multiple, especially when you remove the management discount over failure to provide transparency.""    On the tailwinds of the new Windows 10 operating system and a series of upgraded devices, the tech giant has signaled its commitment to staying lean, and led the way on a ""renaissance of cloud growth,"" Daniel Ives of FBR &amp; Co. wrote in a research note   ""With many of the mature tech stalwarts (Oracle, Cisco, HPQ, IBM) on the 'innovation treadmill,' Satya Nadella has instead helped navigate Microsoft toward the cloud quicker and more successfully than its peers, and it clearly was on display for all to see this quarter,"" Ives wrote.  Ed McGuire of CLSA told CNBC's ""Power Lunch"" that Microsoft's increasing ""hipness factor"" is bearing fruit. ""They actually have some real cache with the new Surface Book and Surface 4 and you know maybe we'll see this drift into a Surface phone in the next few quarters ..."" he said Friday. In conjunction with its ""hipness factor,"" investors might want to pay attention to the tech giant's new holograph computer project called HoloLens.""I mean this whole concept of mixed reality is incredibly innovative,"" McGuire said. ""Now, the question is, how quickly will developers be able to write applications that are going to be usable in daily applications ... this is some of the most amazing technology they've showcased."" ""The consumer and the advertiser are very much alive,"" Squali said. ""There was a lot of concerns around the health of the consumer, both in the U.S. and especially in Europe. And in both cases, whether it's Alphabet/Google or Amazon, they ended up showing accelerated topline growth at a time when they are also providing more visibility into some of the areas that were, up until very recently, somewhat clouded. So I think the combination of the two is really what surprised people to the upside.""   —CNBC's Fred Imbert and Ritika Shah contributed to this report. "
755,2015-10-22T10:01:47-0400,"  Wall Street will keep a close eye on Microsoft's cloud business when the tech giant reports first-quarter fiscal year earnings.  ""Any speed bump on that front would be seen as a negative,"" FBR Capital Markets tech analyst Dan Ives told CNBC.com.   Microsoft has been transitioning from a primarily PC-based company into a cloud-based one, incorporating products like Azure and Office 365 into its commercial and enterprise business.  ""Commercial cloud growth will be important to gauge the strength of the underlying business as well as the progress of the business model transition,"" Nomura Securities analyst Frederick Grieb said in a note Monday.   Indeed, Microsoft's momentum in cloud growth is expected to continue, said Brad Reback, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.  ""We believe the company continues to make steady progress in its cloud transition and expect Office 365 and Azure to be solid contributors to [the] top and bottom line for the next several years,"" Reback said in a note Sunday.  Microsoft posts its earnings Thursday. It is expected to report earnings per share of 58 cents on revenue of $20.96 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate.   Last quarter, the company beat on both earnings and revenue as its cloud business surged 106 percent year over year.   Two other elements on investors' radar are Windows 10 and Microsoft's new reporting structure.  On Oct. 6, Microsoft said that about 110 million devices were running the new operating system, which was unveiled earlier this year.""While this number suggests strong initial adoption of Windows 10, we note that many of the users are likely due to free upgrades on existing devices and unlikely to have a major impact on revenues in first-quarter fiscal year 2016,"" Grieb said.  However, Ives contended in a note Sunday that ""this is the only way to go"" in order for Microsoft and CEO Satya Nadella to gain as many adopters of the operating system as possible.   As for changes to the company's reporting structure, Ives told CNBC.com they will provide more transparency, ""but could make for a knee-jerk reaction on earnings.""   The company announced in late September it will be reporting revenue and operating income on three businesses: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing.   Microsoft will be the second ""traditional tech company"" to report Thursday, following the disastrous earnings report this week from IBM.   Still, ""if you compare Microsoft with IBM … it's a stark contrast,"" Ives said. ""Right now, companies like IBM are facing massive headwinds because their business models are not equipped to successfully transition into the cloud as Microsoft.""   IBM, also Dow Jones industrial average member, reported Monday quarterly earnings per share that were slightly above expectations, but its revenue came in below even the most pessimistic of Wall Street estimates.  —Reuters contributed to this report.  DISCLOSURES: Stifel Nicolaus and FBR Capital Markets act as market makers for Microsoft. Nomura does not. "

Belfiore noted that the payments arena is tough because of the ""massive network of complexity."" Microsoft has been laying the groundwork, hiring Amazon payments product leader Iain Kennedy and applying for money-transfer licenses in various states.  ""Windows is going to have a wallet concept,"" he said. ""We're going to think about the range of payment scenarios.""

757,2018-10-02T07:00:00-0400,"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The technology sector appears to be doing just fine on Wall Street a week after it lost two of its highest-profile components to a newly christened communication services group. The S&amp;P 500 technology index has gained 1.3 percent since the start of last Monday, when Facebook Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc - half of the FANG group of hyper-growth stocks that propelled Wall Street higher in recent years - were pushed out of technology and into the telecom sector, renamed ""communication services."" During that short period of time, the technology index outperformed communication services and consumer discretionary, the third sector affected by the largest ever overhaul of the Global Industry Classification Standard. Bank of America Merrill Lynch recommended on Monday that investors be overweight technology and underweight communication services and consumer discretionary. ""Old Tech represents a lot of what we like: net cash and healthy balance sheets, free cash flow generation, leverage to unit volume sales growth and low earnings risk,"" bank strategist Savita Subramanian wrote in a report. Following the changes to GICS, Cisco Systems Inc and Intel Corp join Visa Inc, Microsoft Corp and Apple Inc as the tech sector's largest five components. Mature companies with storied histories compared to many of their Silicon Valley neighbors, Cisco and Intel have struggled to grow in recent years, but they deliver steady earnings and return cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Netflix Inc, another FANG stock, was moved from consumer discretionary to communication services as part of the reshuffle. It has since rallied nearly 6 percent, helping push the communication services index 1 percent higher.Up 20 percent so far in 2018, technology may benefit from the absence of Alphabet and Facebook, which have underperformed due to worries about regulation in response to criticism of their handling of user data. Amazon, the fourth FANG stocks, remains in consumer discretionary and is now the only part of FANG not in the communication services sector. Since the start of last Monday, the consumer discretionary has risen 0.4 percent. The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.2 percent during the same period. Consumer discretionary and communication services, which between them now include all of the FANG stocks, remain crowded trades at risk of selloff, according to Subramanian.

Microsoft shares are up more than 19 percent since its Aug. 24 low, and now one trader is betting that the stock could hit a fresh multiyear high by the end of the month.    On Monday, in a colorful strategy that options traders refer to as a ""call stupid,"" one trader bet $2 million that Microsoft could soar above $50 by the end of next week. This is a bullish strategy in which a trader will gain exposure to a stock by getting long two separate options strikes of the same expiration rather than create a spread. The goal is for the stock to rise above the higher strike.

Since each call option accounts for 100 shares of stock, this trade is worth nearly $2 million in premium and sees profits if Microsoft rises above $50, or more than 5 percent, by Oct. 30. That puts the stock at its highest level since the dot-com bubble.    ""This isn't a strategy that we talk about very often,"" options expert Mike Khouw  told CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on Monday. ""But I think this is a very smart way to make a bullish bet on the stock ahead of earnings."" Khouw noted that the Microsoft tends to move an average of 4 percent following earnings.

760,2015-10-08T11:31:21-0400,"  Sony has thrown the first punch in the video game industry's annual holiday slugfest. The company on Thursday cut the price of its PlayStation 4 console by $50 to $349.99, effective Friday. The move brings the system to the same price as Microsoft's Xbox One — but could further tip sales in Sony's favor.Microsoft, in many ways, has the superior game lineup this holiday season. Along with multiplatform titles like ""Call of Duty: Black Ops III"" and ""Star Wars: Battlefront,"" it has exclusives like ""Halo 5: Guardians"" and ""Rise of the Tomb Raider."" Analysts had said this created a big opportunity for the company to close the sales gap with Sony. But Sony's price cut could be an effective counter move. The PS4 has held a commanding sales lead in this generation of consoles — and continues to have a better buzz with a large swath of players.The PS4 sold more than 25 million units worldwide from November 2013 through the end of July, and Sony has said it expected to sell 16.5 million units this fiscal year. Microsoft, meanwhile, hasn't given an update on Xbox One sales since November, when it hit 10 million.""Our goal at PlayStation has always been to offer the best place to play at a compelling value to gamers,"" said Shawn Layden, president and CEO of Sony computer Entertainment America. ""We're continuing to deliver on that commitment with this new price for PS4, making the console even more accessible to a broader audience this holiday.""  The price cut is compounded when it's factored in with the many game bundles Sony is offering this holiday season. For the same $350 price, players will also be able to get a free copy of either ""Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection"" or ""Star Wars: Battlefront,"" which is expected to be one of the year's top selling titles.   Sony started this generation of consoles with a big price advantage over Microsoft. The PS4 originally cost roughly $400, while the Xbox One was initially $500. That, combined with a poorly executed introduction of Microsoft's system, allowed Sony to quickly take the sales lead.   Microsoft fought back last year, cutting the Xbox One price to $349. The move worked, to an extent. Microsoft, in a statement citing NPD data, announced in January that the Xbox One was the industry's best-selling system in November and December of 2014.   ""[The] weekly average sales during these months outpaced Xbox 360 by 50 percent at the same point in its lifecycle,"" the company said.   Despite that, the PS4 maintained a commanding overall sales lead — and retook the top sales spot soon after.   At this point in the life cycle of this generation of game systems, the focus begins to shift away from core gamers to the larger mainstream audience. Many households have not upgraded their PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360 because of the price of newer systems and a comparatively small catalog of games. But publishers are dropping support for those legacy systems and focusing resources on the current generation, which is when the broad shift begins to occur — and that's when system price is doubly important.   ""Many of the enthusiasts are taken care of,"" said John Taylor, managing director of Arcadia Investment. ""[Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo] are going to have to start broadening the audience into more households with kids. They need to figure out ... how we're going to keep the hardware momentum going.""

761,2015-10-06T10:52:20-0400,"  Microsoft unveiled Tuesday a new family of phones and devices designed for the Windows 10 operating system at a New York City event.    The Lumia 950 and 950 XL feature an organic LED display that lights up with notifications without the user touching the screen, using close to zero battery life. They also have 32 GB of storage and updated 20-megapixel cameras with image stabilizers and 4K video capabilities. The Lumia 950, at $549, includes a 5.2-inch display and a hexacore processor, while the larger Lumia 950 XL, at $649, has a 5.7-inch display with an octa-core chip. Both will be available in November, with a third phone, Lumia 550, starting at $139 in December.    The phones debuted alongside several other devices, including 2-in-1 tablet Surface Pro 4, a Surface Book laptop, wearable Microsoft Band, virtual reality device HoloLens and limited-edition Xbox One consoles.    The new hardware, with faster processors and better battery life, will showcase the capabilities of Microsoft's new operating system, which is designed to transition more smoothly between devices and focuses on enterprise productivity. The Lumia phones, for example, can run two programs simultaneously, one displayed on a monitor and one in your palm, by plugging in a device called Display Dock.    ""We believe Windows 10 could be a potential game changer,"" analyst Daniel Ives of FBR &amp; Co. wrote in a research note. ""In our opinion the company has done a commendable job narrowing the gap from a technology perspective ... to at least get Microsoft into the conversation among consumers. That said, this is going to be a long road for [Microsoft CEO Satya] Nadella as Microsoft plays major catch-up on this key market, with all hopes relying on Windows 10 to brighten the consumer growth prospects.""    About 110 million devices now run the new OS, with the share of Windows 10-enabled devices at retail growing each month since the launch, Terry Myerson, executive vice president, Windows and devices group at Microsoft, said at the event.    Shares of the technology giant were up around 0.5 percent midafternoon Tuesday.   Microsoft has made its mark in years past in the enterprise and gaming spheres, but struggled to take down iOS and Android in the mobile phone market. Meanwhile, Apple and Google recently upped their bets on enterprise and gaming, on top of renewed phone offerings.    Amid soft demand for its legacy software products, Microsoft has seen revenue hit as it restructures to focus less on personal computers and more on cloud computing, according to its July earnings report. But Nadella said rather than moving away from personal computing, Microsoft's mission is to redefine it.    ""We plan to invent new personal computers and new personal computing,"" Nadella said at Tuesday's event. ""It's ... a device we're excited about, but it's a new paradigm.""   Crawford Del Prete, analyst at IDC, who specializes in enterprise technology, said most people don't realize how the Surface tablets pushed the market forward for similar devices.       ""It's a category that is getting a lot of excitement and innovative designs,"" Del Prete said. ""Microsoft is one of the companies that is responsible for that. There are a lot of skeptics but they created a billion-dollar business in a relatively short period of time.""    Indeed, the Surface Pro 4 took direct aim at Apple's iPad Pro and Pencil. The Surface Pro's Pen has interchangeable tips, an eraser and a year of battery life.    ""It's the best pen and touch experience you've ever witnessed on any product out there,"" Microsoft's device guru, Panos Panay, said Tuesday. ""It's kind of funny there's a pen out there without an eraser.""     Panay also jabbed at Apple's performance specs, saying the Surface Pro 4 is 50 percent faster than MacBook Air.   Other highlights of the convertible tablet, available for preorder Oct. 7 for $899, included 1 TB of storage, an upgraded display, a sturdier keyboard with a fingerprint reader and what Panay called the thinnest optical stack that can be shipped.    Microsoft also released a companion convertible laptop, Surface Book, with similar touch sensitivity, but a more powerful keyboard with back-lit, quiet keys and a glass track pad. The 1.6-pound laptop, optimized for gaming and graphics, has a 13.5-inch display, 12 hours of battery life and high-speed memory, twice as fast as the MacBook Pro.    The computer also has reversible screen with a fulcrum hinge. The Surface Book starts at $1,499, and is available for preorder Oct. 7 and retail Oct. 26, the company said.  Though Microsoft engineers touted the devices as the fastest in their class, they aren't without competition. In addition to more sophisticated iPad Pro and Chromebook offerings, Apple and Android have already delivered in an area where Microsoft lags: a robust app store across devices. Windows phones had less than 3 percent of the worldwide smartphone market as of August, IDC estimated.    ""The thing they really need to do is deliver on universal apps for PC customers,"" Del Prete said.    Panay said universal apps like Facebook and Uber are on the way, in addition to Microsoft Pen-enabled versions of Photoshop and Illustrator. Most Netflix users on Windows 10, for example, now use the app, rather than the browser, Myerson said. Microsoft Office 2016 will available on mobile devices via the cloud, too, the company said in an earlier release.   In addition to its flagship productivity-centered devices, Microsoft also debuted a series of Windows 10 devices for lifestyle and gaming.    The $249 Band wearable, similar to an Apple Watch or a Fitbit, was updated with a curved, scratch-resistant screen and a more flexible strap, and syncs with a universal Microsoft Health app on phones and PCs, said Lindsey Matese of Microsoft's health team . It also includes some exclusive features for hard-core health nuts, like the ability to track elevation, oxygen intake, and calories burned in both carbohydrates and fats, and a golf scorecard.    Xbox One will also see an upgrade in time for the holiday season, the company said, with Windows 10, a new controller for speed and accuracy, and compatibility with Xbox 360 games. New limited-edition consoles with designs inspired by games like ""Halo"" and ""Fallout"" will also launch for the holidays, Microsoft said. The company also gave viewers a peek into what to expect in 2016, with an update on its virtual reality device HoloLens. Microsoft demonstrated a ""mixed reality"" game where the user could fight monsters, moving throughout the room wearing the goggle-like device. The virtual monsters appeared to burst through the walls, highlighting HoloLens' ability to make objects touch and ricochet off any object in a room.  — CNBC's Josh Lipton and Reuters contributed to this report.

Microsoft unveiled the Surface Book at a New York City event on Tuesday, showing the world a $1,499 device that can be used as either a laptop or tablet. Wired magazine called the device the ""ultimate hybrid PC"" and ""the most compelling device the company has ever made.""   It's also Microsoft's first-ever laptop. It's more expensive than Apple's 13-inch MacBook Pro with retina display, and it's also slightly lighter. The Surface Book weighs 3.34 pounds with the keyboard attached, according to Microsoft.

765,2015-10-05T10:07:34-0400,"  Microsoft is expected to unveil its latest set of smartphones as it looks to take another swing at forging a winning mobile strategy in a world dominated by Apple's iOS and Google's Android. Key to it is its Windows 10 operating system.On Tuesday, Microsoft is set to launch two premium handsets at an event in New York along with other devices such as a new wearable and 2-in-1 Surface tablet and the mobile version of Windows 10.   But with the company forecast to hold just 2.6 percent smartphone market share this year, according to IDC, the mass market is shut to Microsoft, analysts said.   ""They know they've lost this generation,"" Ian Fogg, head of mobile at IHS, told CNBC by phone.   ""Windows as a mobile operating system is now irrelevant for the smartphone market. The reason Microsoft is still continuing to make hardware is to maintain a toehold in that part of the market.""   Microsoft's restructuring announcement in July was a realization of this. In July, it took a $7.6 billion writedown on the handset business it bought from Nokia which completed last year and said it will ax 7,800 workers, mostly from the mobile division.    At the time, Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella said the technology giant would focus on running a ""more effective phone portfolio"" and to ""narrow our focus"" on three segments. ""We'll bring business customers the best management, security and productivity experiences they need; value phone buyers the communications services they want; and Windows fans the flagship devices they'll love,"" Nadella said in an email to employees in July.   At the heart of this is Windows 10 operating system which was launched this summer. Microsoft's big push for the operating system is that it works seamlessly across all devices. A feature called ""Universal Apps"" allows developers to create software that can work on mobile devices and desktops without the need to drastically change the coding. Windows 10 is seen as something that can work cross-platform.   ""It's critical for us, we are looking at it as part of a broader ecosystem. We want you to experience Windows across all the devices,"" a source with knowledge of the matter who asked to remain anonymous told CNBC, adding that the company is being aggressive in pushing its Internet of Things (IoT) offerings which go beyond smartphones to encompass wearables and cloud computing.    Analysts estimate that already 100 million devices have Windows 10 installed on them. For Microsoft, the operating system is as a potential driver for consumers to adopt its mobile devices, but analysts are not clear whether this maybe be the case with iOS and Android controlling around 96 percent of the market.    ""A clear Achilles heel for Microsoft is its troubled consumer device strategy, which now appears to be on a trajectory to get a lift on the heels of Windows 10, although the jury is still out on its potential success,"" Daniel Ives, analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said in a note on Monday.    But Microsoft has already made moves to diversify away from relying on hardware sales and this is their future strategy – not a producer of wide-selling smartphones, but as a provider of services for other operating systems which it can monetize.    Microsoft Office – its software previously reserved for Windows devices only – was opened up to Android phones and tablets as well as the iPhone and iPad earlier this year. It also produces the Surface tablet which shows off the capabilities of Windows 10 in the hope other manufacturers begin making similar devices using the OS. Lenovo is already doing this.    In addition, Microsoft has bought a few companies including cloud security company Adallom and calendar app Sunrise. What they all have in common is a focus on productivity, a theme Nadella has been pushing heavily. If Microsoft can get its software and services onto Android and iOS devices, it is able to access majority of the smartphone market and drive revenues, a move analysts see as more fruitful than trying to get people to buy their hardware.   ""It's a much more pragmatic strategy and it's part of a longer term strategy to rebuild and reignite the Windows operating system in smartphones,"" Fogg said.  And ultimately, the opportunity for Microsoft lays in the enterprise business where it can take advantage of the gap left by BlackBerry's downfall.  ""Productivity is the general Microsoft focus and within that business is a key opportunity especially when you look the weakness of BlackBerry in smartphones,"" Fogg added. "
766,2015-10-02T10:00:00-0400,"Getting a leading tech company to help you jump-start your big idea isn't as far-fetched as it sounds. Microsoft is one of many companies that have created a global accelerator program to invest and mentor seed-stage companies in the U.S. and all over the world. The company's activities span all corners of the globe, including Bangalore, Beijing, Paris, London, Seattle and Tel-Aviv. The idea is to get back to its entrepreneurial roots and help support start-ups in a host of areas — from cloud computing to mobile gaming.Here's a look at how some entrepreneurs have managed to get a foot in the door and get adopted in Microsoft's Ventures Accelerator program. The coveted benefits: help to fast-forward product development, garner financing and catalyze growth.  Read MoreMeet the 2015 CNBC Disruptor 50 companies   Huan Ho's experience in the corporate world led him to found his own start-up in August 2013. Called Rallyteam, it is a matchmaking platform for managers looking to assign internal company projects to employees with skills and interests relevant to the work. Too often, Ho said, managers outsource office work instead of recruiting their own people. But to know if what he designed was a good fit for large companies, Ho needed a large company to pilot his platform — something that unexpectedly happened last March when the San Francisco-based Rallyteam headed north to Seattle to begin its four-month stint at the Microsoft Ventures Accelerator.   ""Within three weeks we got a pilot going in a team within Microsoft,"" Ho said. ""For them to get a pilot going within three weeks was amazing.""   Microsoft provided feedback on the Rallyteam platform during the pilot program, helping Ho refine the start-up's product, which in turn helped Rallyteam raise a round of Series A funding — an amount the start-up is keeping private for now — midway through their time at Microsoft's accelerator.    ""Being part of the accelerator and piloting with Microsoft definitely helped with our fundraising efforts,"" he said.   In other cities where Microsoft has set up accelerator programs, early stage start-ups are having similar sorts of opportunities. Microsoft set up its first accelerator program in Tel Aviv in April 2012 and has since taken its accelerators to Beijing, Bangalore, London, Paris and Seattle, which accepted its first accelerator class in 2014. (Rallyteam was a member of Microsoft's second Seattle class.)    This is Microsoft's way of reclaiming its entrepreneurial roots while connecting promising seed-stage start-ups with mentors, developer resources, potential customers and a business curriculum analogous to what an MBA student might receive.    To date, Microsoft has mentored 410 seed-stage companies in its accelerator programs worldwide; 54 of those companies went through Microsoft's U.S. accelerator in Seattle.    ""It's helping create the next era of great start-ups that will turn into great companies … with no strings attached,"" said Hanan Lavy, director of the Microsoft Ventures Accelerator in Seattle. ""We're here to help start-ups on a long-term basis.""   Aside from relocating, start-ups don't exchange much in return. Microsoft takes no equity in start-ups that participate in its accelerators, and generally provides a stipend to help start-ups cover living expenses. Out-of-town start-ups that participate in Microsoft's Seattle accelerator, for instance, receive a one-time check of $25,000. So what does Microsoft get out of it? Access to top early stage technology that it can potentially license or acquire in the future.   Three and a half years into running these accelerators, the success of the programs' 410 graduates has validated Microsoft's move. According to Lavy, 79 percent of start-ups raise an average of $3.7 million in follow-on funding the first year after graduating.    Weekly seminars on go-to-market strategies, funding and financing, product development, customer interactions and more prepare start-ups for what they do once they leave. Ho, who dropped out of the University of Houston's MBA program to pursue Rallyteam, said what he learned during his time in Seattle mirrors a semester in graduate school.   ""They give you a plan for the next four months … [and] every week I knew exactly what we were going to learn,"" he added.   About 10 to 15 start-ups participate in each four-month class — in China the accelerator lasts six months — and Microsoft will look at start-ups that have raised up to $1.5 million, although start-ups don't need to have raised any venture capital to be eligible, Lavy said. Other parameters, like what the product is, who a start-ups' customers are and how long a founding team has worked together are also weighed.    Occasionally, accelerator classes follow themes: For its next Seattle class starting in February, Microsoft is looking for start-ups doing machine learning and other predictive analytics. Lavy said the accelerators are ""open to anyone in any domain,"" but a Microsoft accelerator is probably more beneficial to software start-ups than hardware start-ups.  Prior to joining Microsoft's Seattle accelerator last March, Dorin Rosenshine was skeptical about how much an accelerator could help her New York-based start-up, Outleads, which creates software that enables businesses to expand the reach of their tailored, online advertising by incorporating customers' offline activity — for example, integrating data from a phone call a car buyer makes to a car dealership into the dealership's existing customer relationship management platform. At the time, the Outleads product was the ""bare minimum version,"" she said. But Rosenshine applied and was accepted, and then it was Microsoft that helped her find her first beta users. Not only was Bing Ads a beta user of Outleads but Microsoft also connected Rosenshine to Outleads' largest customer to date.  ""There was a huge effort to bring in all of their partners to have us network with them one on one,"" she said. ""That was something that we needed, because we had the product and had no idea who would use this. The challenge also was, we needed a large organization to deploy this — there needed to be the volume of phone calls, the volume of leads coming in — and Microsoft helped with that.""   The ultimate benefit for Microsoft, though, is being close to interesting new technologies from small companies that might become advantageous business partners in the future.   ""Being part of these ecosystems all around the world is something we wanted to be in,"" said Lavy. ""These start-ups will turn into tomorrow's partners that we want to work with.""   —By Andrew, Zaleski, special to CNBC.com "
767,2015-09-29T07:37:02-0400," Microsoft said it was changing the way it reported financial results to reflect its emphasis on cloud and mobile businesses.   Starting this quarter, the company will report revenue and operating income based on three businesses—Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing.

768,2015-09-16T22:44:27-0400,"  Four months ago Microsoft was reportedly in talks to buy Salesforce.com, in what would have been one of the biggest tech deals on record.    The acquisition never happened, but there are clearly no hard feelings. Microsoft has taken center stage at Salesforce's annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. In addition to a keynote speech from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, the software giant's chairman John Thompson was interviewed by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff during a prime-time session on Wednesday.  None of this was by accident.   ""It's an aggressive move but it's worth it,"" Benioff told a small group of reporters in an informal press conference after his presentation. ""We're not afraid of Microsoft. We want to embrace it."" Read MoreSuper Bowl of Software descends on San Francisco  The relationship between Microsoft and Salesforce has blossomed since Nadella replaced Steve Ballmer early last year. In May 2014, the companies announced a strategic partnership to link Salesforce's cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software with Microsoft Office and Windows. It was a particularly notable agreement because the companies are fierce rivals in the CRM market.   Under Ballmer, Microsoft took a notoriously go-it-alone strategy, focused on selling more Microsoft products, rather than making it easy for customers to plug in other tools. Nadella has taken the opposite approach, emphasizing partnerships and compatibility, even if it means supporting rivals.   ""Ballmer was just anti-partnership,"" Benioff said. ""Satya flipping that switch has really been super powerful for us.""  So powerful that reports of a potential Microsoft-Salesforce tie-up lasted a full month before talks fell apart over price. CNBC reported in May that Benioff wanted up to $70 billion, but Microsoft was only willing to pay $55 billion. The stock market value is currently $47.5 billion.   The two companies put out a joint press release on Wednesday announcing the tighter integration of Salesforce's customer success platform and Microsoft's Office productivity apps. Benioff highlighted the agreement in his on-stage talk and thanked Thompson for helping push Microsoft in a friendlier direction.   In response, Thompson acknowledged that this was his first Dreamforce ""but it won't be my last."" Read MoreMicrosoft aims to catch Amazon in the cloud  Microsoft's cloud business is driving overall growth. The company is generating $8 billion in annual cloud revenue currently, from its Office 365 apps and Azure infrastructure, and expects to reach $20 billion by 2018.    Nadella, in his keynote, talked at length about the importance of working with other technology companies to push Microsoft's mobile apps and cloud platform into a wider swath of businesses.   ""Our customers are going to make choices that make the most sense for them and they're not going to be homogeneous choices,"" he said. ""I don't think of it as zero sum with any one competitor."

770,2015-09-10T12:38:06-0400,"  ""Hell froze over.""  That is how some are describing the moment when a Microsoft  executive took the stage at Apple's annual product event in San Francisco on Wednesday. The two tech giants share a long history, with plenty of acrimony. Steve Jobs, for example, famously said that Microsoft had no taste, according to Walter Issacson's biography of the Apple founder.But times have changed.At the event Wednesday, Apple announced, among other things, a new iPad that starts at $799. CEO Tim Cook's mission is to make this larger iPad Pro, measuring 12.9 inches, more appealing in the workplace.""The iPad is the clearest expression of our vision of the future for personal computing,"" Cook said. ""A simple, multitouch piece of glass that instantly transforms into anything you want it to be.""  Cook knows that, while the broad tablet market has plateaued, the percentage of tablets that companies are buying and managing continues to increase. Research firm Forrester estimates that tablets bought by enterprises will represent 20 percent of the overall market by 2018, up from 12 percent last year.   Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights &amp; Strategy, a tech analyst firm, says that Apple executives also know that, in order to market and sell the iPad Pro as an effective productivity tool, the tablet has to run a first-rate version of Microsoft's Office Suite.   To that end, Apple invited Kirk Koenigsbauer, corporate VP of Microsoft's Office Division, to address the crowd of iOS fans at the event Wednesday. He took the stage, showcasing how the Office software worked on the iPad Pro.    (Phil Schiller, Apple's head of marketing, introduced Koenigsbauer to the audience, and complimented the software giant, saying: ""These guys know productivity."")   As for Microsoft, CEO Satya Nadella, with his mobile-first, cloud-first strategy, wants as many people as possible using his company's apps and tools. If that means aligning with rival platforms, then so be it.   In fact, one of the more surprising recent developments under Nadella is Microsoft's transition into a true industry collaborator, unbundling its technology and announcing integrations with a range of companies, from Salesforce to Citrix to Box.   One question is what this alliance means for Microsoft's line of Surface tablets. Moorhead says it does not indicate that Nadella in any way is giving up on his own ambitions when it comes to this product category. The Surface Pro, he notes, is a direct competitor to the iPad Pro.   Bottom line: Even among friends, there can be fierce competition. "

Today, haggard turns to hero and suddenly Yahoo is the belle of the ball, the magic bullet for Microsoft   , or Google , or AOL, or Apple , or NBCUniversal, or a host of others who think they can reverse Yahoo's internal paralysis and transform Yahoo onto something extraordinary. Now there's speculation that Rupert Murdoch wants to make a play. On the surface, it makes sense since Microsoft ripped a page from the News Corp. playbook by offering such a massive premium to scare away other potential bidders; what Murdoch did with Dow Jones. But that's just the point: News Corp. is busy trying to integrate that multi-billion dollar property into the News Corp. fold. It was a deal many thought Murdoch was over-extending himself to close. And that's a deal 10 times SMALLER than a play for Yahoo would be. Most analysts I'm talking to dismissed this speculation as it began to circulate days after the Microsoft bid first made headlines. No way, they say, that News Corp. could cobble together the funding. And no way they'd do a deal this big so close to the Dow Jones deal. Interesting speculation. Talk about being between a rock and hard place. Some would say Yahoo is in a cultural lose-lose situation: from one evil empire to another. (That's the Silicon Valley/CNBCer in me talking.)

774,2015-08-25T07:59:19-0400,"  Alibaba's cloud-computing arm, Aliyun, has launched an artificial intelligence (AI) platform that it is billing as ""China's first,"" as it looks to boost its cloud offering to compete with Microsoft  and Amazon.    The AI platform, called DT PAI, will allows developers and companies using Alibaba's e-commerce sites, for example, to analyze massive amounts of data in order to predict user behavior as well as industry trends.    This could help inform companies about which products to launch, what customers like and how to target individual users with products.   As the platform grows more advanced, Alibaba said shoppers would even be able to photograph an outfit they see on a stranger and be immediately taken to a page where they can purchase that item of clothing.    Alibaba has been focusing heavily on its cloud division as it looks to diversify its business. In the second quarter of 2015, Alibaba's revenue from cloud computing and Internet infrastructure grew 106 percent year-on-year, according to its latest earnings statement.    The Chinese e-commerce giant last week chose Singapore as the site for its new data center, as well as its international cloud division headquarters, as it looks to increase its strength in Asia.   Alibaba is betting that its ploy to help international companies sell into China via its cloud division will give it an edge over U.S. rivals Amazon and Microsoft.   AI is in its infancy and Alibaba is not the only cloud provider to have introduced a platform.    Earlier this year, Amazon Web Services, the e-commerce titan's cloud division, launched an AI platform and Microsoft's Azure cloud unit also features predictive analytics tools.   Aliyun said that the DT PAI platform will have pre-written alogrithms that mean users will just need to ""drag and drop"" to create apps. Alibaba said this should open up the use of AI to many people, because it removes the need to write complex code. For example, if a user wanted to build an app that looks to predict trends, this algorithm will be written by Alibaba.    ""In the past, the field of artificial intelligence was only open to a very small number of qualified developers and required the use of specialized tools,"" Xiao Wei, senior product expert at Aliyun, said in a statement.    ""However, DT PAI allows developers will little or no experience in the field to construct a data application from scratch in a much shorter period of time. What used to take days can be completed within minutes.""    The first public trial of Aliyun's AI platform will take place ""within weeks"" and users will be invited to the trial.  "

781,2015-07-29T06:53:45-0400,"  Starting today, Microsoft will try to reinvigorate its flagging Windows franchise, reignite falling PC sales, and maybe even save its almost invisible phone business with the release of just one product — Windows 10.   At its heart, Windows 10, which will begin rolling out gradually as a free update, is a rescue mission. It's an attempt to almost fully backpedal from its 2012 predecessor, Windows 8 (they are skipping 9), which was a radical effort to redefine the way Windows looked and worked. That experiment failed to win the hearts and wallets of consumers, and is estimated to have only about a 16 percent share of global PC users.   Instead, Windows 10 more closely resembles an even older version, the 2009-era Windows 7, with a dash of the Windows 8 look and feel retained. Unlike Windows 8 at its launch, the latest version of Windows will boot into the familiar desktop metaphor, and boast a full, working Start menu.

In particular, I had trouble with Windows 10's sexiest new feature, the voice-controlled Cortana intelligent assistant — Microsoft's answer to Apple's Siri — which has migrated from Windows Phones to the PC.   Still, some of the new features are promising, the balance between old and new styles seems right this time, and — if the bugs get erased — Windows 10 would be a good choice for Windows devotees.   However, it's just okay, not disruptive. It's perhaps what Windows 8 might have looked like if it had been evolutionary, not revolutionary. I doubt it will convert many Mac owners, spur a shopping spree in new PCs, bring in droves of new developers, or save the Windows Phone.   And I advise would-be upgraders who aren't enthusiasts to wait to upgrade at least for a few months, until the product is more stable and reliable.   Microsoft says that Windows will now be treated as a ""service,"" with frequent small updates to quash bugs and add features. So this may be the last release of Windows with a formal new name.  Easing the Confusion   Windows 8 confusingly jammed two different interfaces, with two different types of apps and two different optimal input methods (touch and mouse) into the same OS. It eliminated the Start menu and booted instead into a Start Screen with tablet-style apps represented by tiles. The standard desktop, and its standard apps, were demoted.  Read MoreNokia is back....with a virtual reality camera   In Windows 10, PCs boot into desktop mode. The tiled tablet look has been demoted to a section of the restored Start Menu.

What's more, the tablet-style apps run inside windows in the desktop mode, just like traditional Windows programs. A new type of ""universal"" app will supposedly be able to run, in the appropriate mode, on all forms of computers — traditional desktops and laptops, hybrid laptop-tablets, pure tablets and even, later this year, Windows phones.  Cost and Strategy   Microsoft is giving away Windows 10 as a free upgrade to users of the latest revisions of Windows 7 and Windows 8. The free offer lasts up to a year from today, but it won't be immediately available to all. It will begin with beta testers (so-called ""Windows Insiders"") and then spread to people who have reserved copies; then, on to others. A prompt will pop up on PCs that are eligible to upgrade.   The hardware specs for running Windows 10 are identical to those for Windows 7, but it still may not work well on older machines with slower processors and other limitations. The installation app will check for compatibility.  Read MoreApple Music hits 10 million subscribers: Report   Still, Microsoft hopes that hundreds of millions of people will upgrade. That's a reversal of its longtime strategy, in which it paid little attention to upgrades, and saw new versions of Windows as mainly a way to sell new PCs.   The reason? The company hopes that if it can get enough PCs on Windows 10, developers will be incentivized to write the new universal apps. And, since these will also run on Windows Phone, it will help revive that failed mobile platform, which has struggled to attract popular apps.   If you don't, or can't, do a free upgrade, you can buy a new PC, or Microsoft will sell Windows 10 starting at $119.  What's Old Is New   In some ways, the biggest new feature is an old one — the return of the Start menu. As in the past, it's on the lower left of the screen and lets you launch apps and settings easily, and shut down the PC. But now it includes a mini version of the Windows 8 tiled Start Screen, which you can expand.   This menu lists your most-used apps, those you've chosen to pin to the menu (as tiles) and even all apps, if you care to see them. Settings have been simplified and enhanced but — confusingly — for some things, you still have to use the ancient Control Panel, which is still there. Microsoft says it's working to eventually get rid of the Control Panel, but not soon.  Listen to Me (Some of the Time)   The most notable brand-new feature is Cortana, the combo search box and intelligent assistant. By typing in a box labeled ""Ask Me Anything"" at the lower left of the screen or speaking a question using a microphone icon, you can look for files, launch programs, play songs, get information from the Web and more.   For instance, in my tests, it could tell me the weather, or how my calendar looked, or how many people live in Kansas. It could find various documents by searching for words within them, and set reminders. You can even opt to have it listen for a trigger phrase (""Hey, Cortana"") and just speak questions or commands to it without tapping or clicking on the microphone icon. The problem was that ""Hey, Cortana"" failed on me about half the time, and the microphone icon also failed from time to time. I got messages saying ""I didn't get that"" or ""something went wrong"" or ""the Internet and I aren't talking right now."" At one point, I even got a pop-up warning on my PC saying the microphone wasn't designed for Cortana. And this was on a new Dell XPS 13, lent to me by Microsoft for testing, which costs more than $1,500. Read MoreLucrative tech jobs lead workers to coding school   Cortana needs work on the PC in Windows 10.  Navigation and Notification   I very much liked two new navigation and notification features. One, called Task View, appears when you swipe right on a touchscreen from the left edge, or tap or click on a button at the left end of the task bar. It shows all your open windows and lets you select among them. But it's a catch-up feature: Apple has had something similar, now called Mission Control, for years.   The other, called Action Center, appears when you swipe to the left from the right edge of the screen, or tap or click an icon near the right edge of the task bar. This shows notifications, like new emails, Facebook posts and similar things. It also has quick settings, including the ability to switch to tablet mode. Alas, again, the Mac has had something like this for awhile now, which also appears at right side of the screen.  Other New Stuff   Another of the big new features is a new Web browser called Edge. Its main feature that isn't a catch-up is the ability to draw or scribble on Web pages and then send these annotations to others. This is not something I believe most people would use frequently. A full review of Edge by my colleague, Lauren Goode, is here.   Gamers will love a new Xbox app, which can stream games to a properly configured PC from an Xbox One, and includes a screen-capture feature that takes images and videos of the action. I couldn't test that.   There's also a new function called Windows Hello that lets you replace a login PC password with facial, iris or fingerprint recognition. But my Dell test unit lacked the hardware needed to test that.   The built-in apps — Mail, Calendar, Photos, Maps, Music and more — are much improved from their counterparts in Windows 8. But they still need work, especially Mail. It lacks a unified inbox and unified unread view for all your accounts. And, just like Apple's built-in Mail app, it had periodic trouble with Gmail.  Continuum   Though I couldn't test this, Microsoft now has a feature called Continuum, which allows you to switch to tablet mode — but doesn't force you to do so. For instance, if you have a hybrid PC, and separate the screen and keyboard to use it as a pure tablet, tablet mode can be turned on, and you can continue your work where you left off.  Downsides   If you love watching DVDs on your PC, or still use floppy drives, you'll now need third-party software for that.  Also — and this may not be the fault of Windows 10 — I still found the touchpad on my expensive test Dell laptop to be slow and jerky compared with the one on my Mac. This wasn't supposed to be the case, since the machine has a new so-called ""precision"" touchpad promoted by Microsoft. But the touchscreen worked very smoothly.  Bottom Line   Windows 10 will finally give the great majority of PC users, who still use Windows 7, a familiar but improved upgrade. However, by making that upgrade free, Microsoft may be dampening, not boosting, the market for new PCs, at least in the short run.   I regard Windows 10 as a solid, evolutionary operating system that's likely to be a good bet for people who like Windows.

Already there have been acts of violence against these machines.But as robots develop more advanced artificial intelligence empowering them to think and act like humans, legal standards need to change.Companies need to develop new labor laws and social norms to protect these automated workers.By the year 2025, robots and machines driven by artificial intelligence are predicted to perform half of all productive functions in the workplace. What is not clear is whether the robots will have any worker rights.Companies across many industries already have robots in their workforce. DHL uses autonomous robots by Fetch Robotics to help fulfillment center and warehouse employees, while Toyota, Google and Panasonic are among the companies that use Fetch's mobile manipulator technology in research efforts.Humans already have shown hatred toward robots, often kicking robot police resources over or knocking down delivery bots in hopes of reclaiming a feeling of security or superiority. Incidents of violence against machines are nothing new. Man has been at odds with machines for many decades. We kick the car when it does not operate, shove the vending machine when it does not dispense, and bang at the sides of the printer when it does not produce a copy. What is new is that it will only be a matter of time before the automated creatures will ""feel"" this hostility and/or feel the need to retaliate. And if we grant robots rights as quasi-citizens, will they be charged with assault and battery and legally responsible for the harm they may cause under criminal or civil law? Or should a robot's programmer be held jointly responsible?These acts of hostility and violence have no current legal consequence — machines have no protected legal rights. But as robots develop more advanced artificial intelligence empowering them to think and act like humans, legal standards need to change.Several studies show that we are spending considerable time worried about what robots will do to humans. According to the World Economic Forum's future of jobs study, ""if managed wisely, [machine integration] could lead to a new age of good work, good jobs and improved quality of life for all, but if managed poorly, pose the risk of widening skills gaps, greater inequality and broader polarization."" According to a survey by Pew Research Center ""Americans express broad concerns over the fairness and effectiveness of computer programs making important decisions in people's lives.""Few are considering this trend from the perspective of the rights of our automated coworkers. What legal standing should the robot in the cubicle next to you have from a labor, employment, civil rights or criminal law perspective, and as a citizen? There are still far more questions than answers.Can a robot be programmed to be racist? Can a robot sexually harass a co-worker, human or non-human? Will humans discriminate against the machines? Will workplace violence or intolerance be tolerated against robots? Will robots at some point be able to feel pain, stress, anxiety, a lack of inclusiveness or overt discrimination? How might it affect their productivity? How might it affect the culture of the company? Will robots react to human violence or incivility in turn? Could a robot discriminate against another robot? Should robots be compensated for their work? How and when? Are they eligible for vacation or medical benefits? What if a robot causes harm to a coworker or customer? Who's responsible? Will robots be protected by unions? If a robot ""invents"" something in the workplace, or improves a product or service of the company, who or what will own the intellectual property?As the retail and technology giant Amazon has come to learn, integration of machine learning may unintentionally cause big problems and expose a company to unexpected ridicule or even litigation. Amazon was developing a recruiting engine programed to help the company find top talent and make the recruiting process more efficient. But the outcome discovered in testing of the secret system was discrimination against female candidates, and exposure to bad press.The AI system was not programmed to be biased against women, in fact, many thought it may actually help remove human biases all together. So what happened? The system was trained to screen applications by observing patterns in old resumes (most of which were submitted by men) and eventually, the machine taught itself to vet out female applicants. Amazon scrapped the technology while it was still a work-in-progress, but the company has surely learned a valuable lesson, and it will not be the last to do so.Robots are predicted to serve in more meaningful roles within business and society than the basic manufacturing jobs, online customer service and order fulfillment they already handle. We may even begin to see AI-driven robots sitting in the seats of boards of directors at Fortune 500 companies or on a judge's bench. An AI-based astronaut assistant, CIMON, is currently working on the International Space Station. In 2017, a European Parliament legal affairs committee recommended a resolution that envisions a special legal status of ""electronic persons"" to protect the most sophisticated automated robots, a political idea that remains controversial among politicians, scientists, business people and legal experts.Considering the issues is an important step employers and employees must consider if our society hopes to achieve the singularity and symbiosis of machine integration into a workplace. In the next five to ten years, we'll need an entirely new set of labor and employment laws affecting EEOC, unions, workplace violence, intellectual property, termination, downsizing and family leave, not to mention a new set of social and workplace norms and best practices.Many may remember the hitchhiking robot that made headlines on its journey to cross the United States only to be destroyed two weeks into its journey in Philadelphia (the robot did successfully travel across Canada before its ultimate demise). Some of this abuse stems from tomfoolery, some stems from pure vandalism, and some may stem from fear. Regardless of the reasoning, the abuse raises concerns regarding humans' ethics towards technology. As Peter W. Signer, a political scientist and the author of ""Wired for War"", has said, ""The rationale for robot 'rights' is not a question for 2076, it's already a question for now.""Andrew Sherman is a partner in the Washington, D.C., office of Seyfarth Shaw and the author of 26 books on business growth, capital formation and intellectual property.

For Microsoft investors, Windows 10 needs to be a hit. The franchise still accounts for some 25 percent of the company's revenue. And it impacts a lot of people: More than 1 billion users rely on Windows.   But expectations are muted. A financial bump from Windows 10 would show up in the company's Devices &amp; Licensing group. Right now, Wall Street thinks sales in that division will fall 6 percent in 2016. Analysts have been disappointed with the most recent upgrades.   ""The expectations are so low based on what we saw with Windows 8,"" said Patrick Moorhead, president and principal analyst of Moor Insights &amp; Strategy. ""I think investors will probably be surprised at how well they do. And also, it's the way Microsoft is accounting for Windows. They are being very conservative. They are saying it won't have an impact until next year. They are playing it very safe.""   But Moorhead thinks Windows 10 will prove popular, pointing to all its new bells and whistles. There's an all-new browser called Microsoft Edge, allowing users to write or type notes directly on webpages and share them with others. Cortana, Microsoft's digital assistant, which responds to voice commands, also comes to the desktop. The operating system starts up and resumes fast; boasts more built-in security features; and it's designed to run across a wide range of devices including smartphones, tablets and PCs. Read MoreWhat you need to know about Microsoft's giveaway  Microsoft bulls say the new operating system should excite developers, who can now write one software application for many platforms; allow Microsoft to cross-sell users on different services, from Office 365 to OneDrive; and spur PC sales in the back half of the year.   ""I believe Windows 10 will spark a PC hardware increase in the fourth quarter,"" said Moorhead. ""I don't think we will see that lift in the third quarter because that quarter will mostly be about the promotion of the upgrade.""    Moorhead added, ""I think people have to first realize the benefits of Windows 10 before they are inspired to buy a new system.""   On the other hand, FBR's Christopher Rolland is skeptical Windows 10 will give a real boost to weak PC sales. That's because consumers using Windows 7 and Windows 8 can upgrade to Windows 10 for free.   ""Consumers won't need to upgrade their hardware,"" Rolland said. ""So, for the first time, hardware and software are truly disconnected in terms of purchase cycles.""   Research firm IDC expects PC shipments to drop 6.2 percent this year, which would be the fourth consecutive year of declining volume as the PC market competes with mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets.    Beyond financial metrics and business strategy, analysts say the launch of Windows 10 is a critical moment for the reputation of CEO Satya Nadella, who took the helm of Microsoft in February 2014. He's earned praise for his decisions to focus on mobile technology, cloud services and transforming the company into an industry collaborator.    But analysts say the launch of Windows 10 is a different kind of test for the CEO.     ""Nadella will be tied to Windows 10,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR. ""If it's not successful then the optimism around the Nadella era takes a huge hit. They are betting a lot on this. So much of the growth, so much of the cloud-centric vision is tied to Windows 10. All eyes will be on the success of this platform in the next three to six months.""    Microsoft has set ambitious goals. The software giant wants 1 billion Windows 10 devices in the market within three years. Wednesday is the start of that campaign. Read MoreWindows 10 review: Microsoft steps back to move forward"

Shares of Nvidia's chief rival in the graphics chip market, Advanced Micro Devices Inc, have also been whipsawed by swings in the cryptocurrency markets.Analysts were troubled by Nvidia's gross margin forecast of 62.8 percent, slightly below expectations of 62.9 percent and possibly a result of putting more memory modules on its chips.Analyst KinNgai Chan of Summit Insights Group said Nvidia shares were likely to trade lower as analysts reset their expectations around slower growth rates.The cryptocurrency news and the lower-than-expected forecast clouded an otherwise strong quarter, including Nvidia's sales of chips to data centers, where companies such as Amazon.com's Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Corp's Azure as well as Alphabet Inc's Google Cloud are buying up the chip to power artificial intelligence and other functions.Nvidia's largest and oldest business of selling graphical processing units, or GPUs, for video game players beat analyst estimates, bringing in $1.8 billion compared with estimates of $1.75 billion, according to data from FactSet.Analysts had braced for lower gaming chip sales because Nvidia is widely expected to unveil a new generation of gaming chips ahead of the holiday shopping seasons, possibly as soon as next week. Gamers typically hold off on purchasing chips when new models are just around the corner.Revenue from the company's closely watched data center chips business rose 83 percent to $760 million, topping analysts' estimate of $743.6 million, according to FactSet.Rivals Intel Corp and AMD have also been buoyed by the surge in demand from data centers, a rapidly expanding market powered by the explosive growth in mobile and Web apps.Net income rose 89 percent to $1.1 billion for the fiscal second-quarter.

On Monday, the software giant said that it's partnering with Rackspace Hosting, which will provide its trademark ""fanatical support"" for Microsoft's Azure cloud service.  ""The next wave of cloud adoption is going to come from more traditional enterprise customers who value support and expertise from a company like Rackspace,"" said John Engates chief technology officer of San Antonio, Texas-based Rackspace.

791,2015-07-09T09:26:56-0400,"  Microsoft announced Wednesday that it was shedding thousands of jobs and taking a massive write-down on its Nokia devices business, but analysts say the tech giant has very little choice but to stay firmly committed to the smartphone market.   The U.S. company giant said Wednesday it was slashing 7,800 positions and take a $7.6 billion write-down on its struggling handset business – the division it bought from Nokia for $7.2 billion in 2012.    ""We are moving from a strategy to grow a standalone phone business to a strategy to grow and create a vibrant Windows ecosystem including our first- party device family,"" CEO Satya Nadella wrote in an email to employees.   This apparent mixed message highlights one key point: Microsoft has no choice but to stay in the smartphone game for now, analysts say,  given the upcoming release of its hotly anticipated Windows 10 operating system.   The ""ecosystem"" Nadella is referring to is Windows 10, the operating system being released this month that Microsoft has pinned a lot of its future success on. The U.S. company hopes that this will be an OS widely used across a number of devices including PCs, laptops, tablets and smartphones and this is why it needs to stay in the handset business, analysts said.   ""It is still extremely important Microsoft makes some mobile devices to show what is possible with Window's 10,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC by phone.   Microsoft has taken a similar path with its Surface tablet. It created the tablet that doubles up as a PC and put the Windows OS on it in order to show what could be achieved with its OS on a smaller device. Other device manufacturers such as Lenovo have made devices with a similar design and used the Windows OS, for which Microsoft is paid a licensing fee.    Analysts said that Microsoft will need to replicate this model in smartphones and make a ""benchmark"" device that other manufacturers will be able to make and put Windows 10 on. In this way, the Redmond, WA-based firm can push Windows 10 to a bigger audience than it could with manufacturing its own devices.    ""Microsoft is coming out with Windows 10 and their strategy is mobile first and cloud first. I don't think it would make much sense for them to ditch phones right now,"" Roberta Cozza, mobile analyst at Gartner, told CNBC.  ""It makes sense for them to take another look at phones, limit the portfolio and take a more focused approach.""  Microsoft has attempted to make its smartphones more attractive. As part of Windows 10, it has tools that allow developers to create an app for the PC but easily make it compatible with a smartphone. The aim is to attract more developers to make apps for Windows mobile, something it has seriously struggled with in the past.   The lack of appeal for its devices and the fact that it hasn't released a major flagship smartphone in over a year has made it a weak player in the global market. During this time, Apple has strengthened its position at the premium end of the market while Samsung regained its position as the world's biggest smartphone player, according to IDC. Microsoft has just a 3 percent market share.    Cozza said Microsoft could look to be a player in the enterprise space like BlackBerry, but this is ""niche"". Even if it can't exit the device business right now, analysts haven't ruled it out in ""one or two years"" as struggles are likely to continue.   ""Ditching it altogether, not yet, but it might become inevitable,"" Cozza said. "

The new job cuts are expected to affect people in Microsoft's hardware group, among other parts of the company, including the struggling smartphone business that it acquired from Nokia last year in a $7.2 billion deal.  At the end of March, Microsoft had more than 118,000 employees globally.   Frank X. Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman, declined to comment. Microsoft executives have been hinting at more cutbacks for months. Satya Nadella, who became Microsoft's chief executive early last year, sent a company wide email in late June intended to rally employees for the coming year. But he also warned in the message that Microsoft will need to ""make some tough choices in areas where things are not working and solve hard problems in ways that drive customer value.""

Another area in which Microsoft is stumbling is smartphones, a market in which it has continued to lose market share since acquiring Nokia's handset business. Microsoft has so far failed to turn the Windows Phone operating system, which runs on its handsets, into a vibrant alternative to the two leading mobile platforms, iOS from Apple and Android from Google.

Still, analysts have said Microsoft may soon acknowledge missteps in the smartphone business with a large write-down of the value of its Nokia acquisition. The announcement of that accounting charge, which could amount to several billion dollars, is expected by many to occur before Microsoft reports earnings this month. "

The collaboration between the U.S. technology giant and NASA is called ""Sidekick"" is meant to be a ""virtual aid to astronauts working off the Earth, for the Earth"", according to the space agency. HoloLens projects holographic images onto the surrounding environment and allows people to interact with the projected images.    Astronauts will use Microsoft-owned Skype via HoloLens to allow the ground operator to see what the crew members see and provide real-time guidance to resolve issues. The ground operator could also ""write"" notes and ""draw"" diagrams on to a crew member's environment to help them through a task. Previously the astronaut would have relied on written and voice instructions for complex repair tasks or experiments.   The second potential use will see HoloLens project animated holographic illustrations on top of object with which the crew is interacting. NASA said this could reduce the amount of training crews require and ""could be an invaluable resource for missions deep into our solar system, where communication delays complicate difficult operations"".   ""This new technology could also empower future explorers requiring greater autonomy on the journey to Mars,"" Sam Scimemi, director of the ISS program at NASA, said in a statement.   NASA and Microsoft have been testing project Sidekick in a weightless environment to see whether the device can function in the low gravity environment of the ISS.

So they have to either remove our technology or stop selling it,"" i4i's Owen said.The final judgment from the U.S. District Court followed a jury verdict issued in favor of i4i on May 20.""We believe the evidence clearly demonstrated that we do not infringe and that the i4i patent is invalid,"" Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz said."

""I don't think BlackBerry has seen the kind of competition we can provide them now.""Research in Motion's BlackBerry created the market for mobile e-mail, and its dominant position in the corporate sector, especially in North America, has protected it from Nokia's attempts to crack the market in recent years.The alliance also aims to counter Google's recent move into free online software, targeted at Microsoft's business customers, and the growing popularity of Apple Inc's iPhone device.""It's clear that Nokia and Microsoft are both facing competitive challenges, most notably from Google,"" said John Jackson, an analyst at wireless research firm CCS Insight. ""It makes sense for these two companies to work together to see if they can pool their competitive strengths to try and counter some of this pressure.""The alliance means Microsoft's new Office suite of applications could be available to a much wider audience. Nokia accounts for 45 percent of smartphones worldwide, according to research firm Gartner, with about 200 million users.The two companies stressed that the new venture will not affect the future of Microsoft's Windows Mobile and Nokia's Symbian operating systems for smartphones. Executives said Nokia has no plans to make a Windows Mobile device.""We are extremely committed to Symbian,"" said Andersson. This is very clear.

""Yahoo is playing a dangerous fiduciary game and at this point I can't see how this deal doesn't get done,"" CNBC's Silicon Valley Bureau Chief Jim Goldman said. ""Yahoo has no other deal on the table, Microsoft is offering a hefty premium, and sticking your head in the sand isn't going to make this hostile bid just go away."" Yahoo's board is reviewing the letter, said a person close to the company. Directors of the Sunnyvale, California-based company have rebuffed Microsoft's original offer, saying the bid undervalues Yahoo and that it is seeking alternatives.Ballmer said Microsoft is growing impatient more than two months after the Redmond, Washington-based software behemoth made its unsolicited takeover offer for Yahoo. At that time, the bid represented a 62 percent premium to Yahoo's share price.""Steve Ballmer is an emotional guy and the emotion comes through and it's frustration,"" said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, a Microsoft shareholder. ""I really don't think it's going higher than $31. That ship has sailed.""The Microsoft letter argues that the economy and the market for Internet stocks have deteriorated in the intervening period, and that Yahoo's share of Web search and online advertising business has declined, referring to industry market reports. ""During these two months of inactivity, the Internet has continued to march on, while the public-equity markets and overall economic conditions have weakened considerably,'' Ballmer wrote.The deadline falls on April 26, four days after Yahoo and two days after Microsoft report their quarterly results.Ballmer said Yahoo's board, despite its efforts, had failed to woo a competing offer from ""others in the industry.""Yahoo has held talks with News Corp. and Time Warner's AOL division about possible deals, but these discussions appear to have yielded no alternatives yet.A Yahoo investor, whose firm met with Yahoo management earlier this week and declined to be identified, said the company emphasized the deal with Microsoft involved regulatory risks that would undercut a merger's potential value.The management, according to the investor, presented alliances with AOL and Google as possibly better options.Brendan Barnicle, who follows Microsoft for Pacific Crest Securities, said that by removing the hope of a higher bid, Microsoft had given Yahoo directors the legal cover to accept Microsoft's existing offer and fend off shareholder lawsuits.It's part of a highly choreographed dance and parallels the take-it-or-leave-it bidding strategy Oracle Corp has used to win a string of deals to consolidate the software industry.""The big overhang on Microsoft stock has been that they would have to raise their bid,"" Barnicle said.Meanwhile, Yahoo has adopted measures that make a merger with Microsoft more costly, Ballmer complained.A few weeks after Microsoft's offer, Yahoo's board put in place a generous severance plan, commonly known as a ""golden parachute,"" to all employees if the company was sold. Part of Microsoft's justification for the deal was that it expected to wring out $1 billion in cost savings.The original 62 percent premium to Yahoo's share price on the day the offer was announced has fallen along with Microsoft's stock price, which has taken a hit from declines in the U.S. stock market and skepticism about whether Microsoft's unsolicited bid will succeed.Yahoo shares plunged nearly 5 percent in after-hours trading Friday following news that Microsoft was re-evaluating its offer. In regular trading, Yahoo stock closed Friday at $28.36, while Microsoft ended the week at $29.16. Both trade on Nasdaq.Based on Friday's closing price, the premium to Yahoo's stock is around 45 percent, while the current total value of Microsoft's offer is $42.2 billion in cash and stock.Microsoft has argued that the offer's premium to Yahoo's stock has, in fact, increased, because the Web pioneer's stock would have fallen in lock-step with its online rivals. Shares of Google , Yahoo's most direct competitor, has fallen more than 16 percent since Microsoft's offer.Microsoft's view of business conditions at Yahoo runs contrary to Yahoo's own outlook for itself. Last month, the company went public with a rosy revenue outlook for the next two years and appealed directly to shareholders during a road show that Microsoft's offer is not enough."
802,2015-06-01T06:01:41-0400,"  At long last, Microsoft has finally given a release date for its highly-anticipated Windows 10.   The U.S. technology giant said its new operating system will be available from July 29 in 190 countries, and that users of Windows 7 and 8.1 will be able to upgrade for free.   ""With Windows 10, we start delivering on our vision of more personal computing, defined by trust in how we protect and respect your personal information, mobility of the experience across your devices, and natural interactions with your Windows devices,"" Terry Myerson, executive vice president at Microsoft, said in a blog post on Monday.  Windows 10 is the Redmond, WA company's first major operating system release since the heavily-criticized Windows 8 in 2012.    The company is betting big on the software, and aims to make Windows 10 the go-to operating system for a range of devices, from personal computers to smartphones.   One of its key features is called ""Universal Apps."" This system enables developers to easily create apps which will run across all Windows devices, whether it be a smartphone or PC. Developers normally have to write different codes for different devices.Read MoreCan Microsoft make a smartphone comeback?  Taking on board user criticism following the last version of Windows, Microsoft said it was bringing back its classic start menu.   The company is also making a lot of noise about Cortana – its digital personal assistant that learns your preferences and provides information, much like Apple's Siri. Microsoft is also overhauling the ""Internet Explorer"" web browser and launching a new one called ""Edge.""    Windows 10 marks a huge shift in Microsoft's thinking. Once, the operating system was something the company could sell and earn a lot of money from; now, it is a means of accessing a large number of consumers and offering a range of services across different devices. In the past, people upgraded their operating system every couple of years, but now updates will be more regular.    ""We will continue to update Windows 10 over time with new innovations to help you be more productive and have more fun. Like Windows 10 itself, these updates will be free for the supported lifetime of your device,"" Myerson added.   Users wanting to get their hands on Windows 10 need to register their interest online. When it is available, customers can schedule a time to download it.  "
803,2008-03-14T11:49:19-0400,"Senior executives from Microsoft and Yahoo met Monday to discuss Microsoft's takeover bid for the company, according to two people familiar with the matter. The meeting was said to be the first since Microsoft made its unsolicited offer for Yahoo, worth nearly $42 billion, on Jan. 31. Yahoo rejected the offer as inadequate last month. The meeting was not a negotiation and no bankers were present, one of the sources said. The session was intended to allow Microsoft to present its vision of a combined company, and Yahoo executives mostly listened, the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news, said, citing a person familiar with the matter.Financial terms were not discussed and it was unclear which executives took part, the Journal said. Microsoft and Yahoo spokesmen declined to comment. Since Yahoo rejected Microsoft's offer last month, no other bids have been made public nor has Microsoft sweetened its bid, leaving the two companies in a stalemate. Yahoo has held talks with News Corp and Time Warner Inc's AOL, sources told Reuters. The meeting with Microsoft is part of the company's strategy to keep all its options open, people familiar with the matter said. Yahoo recently extended the deadline for nominations to its board of directors in an effort seen by analysts and investors as forestalling a potential hostile effort by Microsoft. Microsoft had originally proposed to pay nearly $45 billion for Yahoo, but the value of its offer has since declined to less than $42 billion as its shares have fallen 12 percent. Microsoft shares were down 27 cents, or 1 percent, at $28.39 in Friday morning trade on the Nasdaq, while Yahoo shares were down 60 cents, or 2.2 percent, at $26.90. News Corp Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch has said he would not fight Microsoft for a Yahoo deal. AOL on Thursday said it was buying the social networking site Bebo, in a move that some say signals that its parent, Time Warner, has plans that do not involve Yahoo. "
804,2008-03-12T09:47:44-0400,"Hulu.com is finally going public on Wednesday. After a four-and-a-half-month long public beta, the video site, co-founded and jointly owned by News Corp. and NBC Universal (parent of CNBC), is launching officially.Now anyone will be able to stream TV shows and movies -- all free and ad-supported. I had an exclusive interview with Hulu.com CEO Jason Kilar, who gave us an early look at the new site. I've been using Hulu.com for months now -- I'm one of the 5 million viewers who watched a video on the beta site in the past thirty days, a sign of the company's potential for success. The site launches broadly with more than 50 content partners, providing 250 TV series and 100 full-length feature films. The site started with content from (General Electric -owned) NBC Universal's network and cable properties, Fox, as well as MGM and Sony Pictures Television. Now they're announcing licensing deals with Warner Bros. Television Group, Lionsgate, the NBA, and NHL, as well as full NCAA basketball games from the last 25 years. So that means you can pick between that sports content, and hit shows like The Simpsons, old shows like Miami Vice, and movies like The Big Lebowski -- all on the same site. And since content doesn't just mean TV and movies anymore, they're also including made-for-the-Internet webisodes from Prom Queen (Michael Eisner's venture) and Onion News Network. This is certainly a step up from Hulu's early days, when it just had a handful of NBC and Fox episodes. For Hulu to really take off, it's going to need to be a go-to destination for content -- like turning on your TV. And that means getting a lot more content partners -- which Kilar tells me are in the works. For now, it seems to be working -- at least based on the fact that the ad inventory sold out in the beta period, and is selling out now. Hulu isn't just a destination website -- the company also distributes its shows -- along with the matching ads to partner sites -- AOL, Yahoo , Microsoft's MSN, Comcast's Fancast, and News Corp.'s Myspace. This is part of thht whole ""give em what they want, when they want it"" theory of new media distribution. And to extend that approach one step further, Hulu encourages users to clip and share pieces of the content on its site. But in an anti-YouTube (owned by Google ) approach, ads follow those clips wherever they go- whether they're embedded on your blog or social networking page. Hulu has a ways to go, but for now at least, online video ad content is so scarce, that with big advertisers like Best Buy and Unilever already in pocket, it'll have no problem filling its ad time. And to roughly quote ""Field of Dreams"" -- if they post the content, they (viewers) will come. Questions?  Comments?  MediaMoney@cnbc.com"
805,2008-02-24T21:21:07-0500,"Microsoft said it will stop making HD DVD players for its Xbox 360 video game system after Toshiba ceded the high-definition video format battle to Sony's Blu-ray. Microsoft said Saturday it would continue to provide standard warranty support for its HD DVD players. Toshiba President Atsutoshi Nishida last week estimated about 300,000 people own the Microsoft video player, sold as a separate $130 (euro88) add-on for the Xbox 360. ""HD DVD is one of the several ways we offer a high definition experience to consumers and we will continue to give consumers the choice to enjoy digital distribution of high definition movies and TV shows directly to their living room, along with playback of the DVD movies they already own,"" Blair Westlake, a corporate vice president of Microsoft's media and entertainment group, said in a written statement. Microsoft was one of HD DVD's main backers, along with Intel and Japanese electronics maker NEC, and its support for the format was seen as a big win for Toshiba's format. But support for the HD DVD waned as major movie studios -- Sony Pictures, Walt Disney, News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox and Warner Bros. Entertainment -- picked Blu-ray to distribute high-def DVDs. Wal-Mart Stores struck what seemed to be the final blow just over a week ago when it said it would only sell Blu-ray players and discs. Microsoft said it is looking at how the HD DVD technology it has developed, such as HDi, which adds interactive features to HD DVDs, and its VC-1 video encoding technology, can be applied to other platforms. The Redmond, Wash.-based software maker said the decision to stop selling HD DVD players won't have a material impact on its video game business. "

Ultimately, the two companies remained far apart on a price, with Microsoft said to be willing to offer roughly $55 billion for the company, while its founder and CEO Marc Benioff is said to have kept raising his expectations to as high as $70 billion.   The deal envisioned Microsoft using a significant portion of its $95 billion cash pile to pay for Salesforce, but there was discussion of allowing Benioff to roll his 5.7 percent stake in Salesforce into Microsoft stock, while other shareholders would have gotten paid in cash.

The two cables will transfer data across the world to customers at rapid speeds, which Microsoft hopes will give it an edge over its competitors while expanding the reach of its cloud business.   ""As people and organizations expect data and information at their fingertips Microsoft must have an infrastructure that can deliver the cloud services… which our customers need to support their global businesses,"" David Crowley, managing director of network enablement at Microsoft, wrote in a blog post on Monday.   Microsoft also confirmed Monday it had joined a consortium made up of China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, Chunghwa Telecom, KT Corporation with TE SubCom to invest in a cable connecting North America to China.    ""The goal of our expansions and investments in subsea cables is so our customers have the greatest access to scale and highly available data, anywhere,"" Crowley added.   Under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft has focused on becoming a cloud-first company. In the quarter ending March 31, Microsoft reported a 106 percent year-on-year rise in commercial cloud revenue.    But the cloud space is extremely competitive. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is expanding its cloud business outside of its home market, while Amazon's chief technology officer recently told CNBC that cloud could overtake its retail business.   Microsoft is not the only company to invest in underwater cables. Last year, Google was part of $300 million investment to connect major West Coast U.S. cities to locations in Japan.  "
813,2015-05-08T10:36:56-0400,"  After a big rally in 2014, Microsoft shares are up just 3 percent in 2015, albeit with a great deal of volatility. And that has traders hopping into the options market to find a way to make the stock work for them.  According to Stacey Gilbert, head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna, most of the options activity is being initiated by owners of the stock who are ""overwriting"" the shares. That is, holders are selling call options against their holding of the stock.  Since a call option grants the right to buy a stock for a given price within a given time, an individual who owns a stock and sells an upside call is forgoing the right to enjoy gains. In exchange, an individual is able to squeeze more money out of the stock.   For instance, Gilbert notes that there has been heavy interest in the Microsoft July 50-strike calls, which on Friday morning are trading at about 60 cents. If Microsoft stays below $50 through mid-July, these puts will expire worthless, offering an extra 1.3 percent yield over the next 10 weeks. That's 6.5 percent on annualized basis (without accounting for interest, or transaction fees). Add in the tech giant's 2.6 percent dividend yield, and earning more than 9 percent on Microsoft shares becomes a very real possibility. Read MoreCan Microsoft make a smartphone comeback? Of course, the strategy is not without risk, as a trader is still on the hook if the stock falls—thus exposing the owner of the overwrite structure to asymmetrical risk on the downside. However, the extra yield does provide a nice cushion if the stock does fall. There is risk on the upside, too, because if the stock rises to above the call's strike price, the stock will be ""called away,"" and the jig is up.  But if the stock stays in a close range, then the potential profits can be great indeed.  Want to be part of the Trading Nation?

814,2015-05-06T08:57:27-0400,"  Despite reports that Microsoft is interested in buying Salesforce.com, Oracle  is still the most likely buyer of the cloud services firm if reports of buyout talks are indeed true, analysts said Wednesday.   Shares of Salesforce shot higher Tuesday afternoon amid reports that Microsoft was considering a bid for the company.    Microsoft declined to comment. Salesforce said it does not comment on rumors or speculation.    ""Whether Microsoft would make a serious bid, I'm more doubtful. I think Oracle probably makes the most sense,"" Rick Sherlund, director of technology research at Nomura Securities, said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""   No deal is imminent, according to Bloomberg. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Salesforce hired financial advisors after being approached by potential buyers. Industry watchers have since speculated that Oracle is the company behind the initial reported bid.  Read MoreHere's why Microsoft could buy Salesforce   Sherlund ticked off a list of reasons why Oracle is the more likely suitor: It's a better strategic fit, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff used to work for Oracle Executive Chairman Larry Ellison, and Oracle has excess sales capacity that would help it do a deal.   FBR Capital Markets' Samad Samana  also believes Oracle is the most likely bidder.   However, he and Sherlund said a deal would make sense for both Oracle and Microsoft.   ""There's not any type of transformative acquisition in the cloud that you can do that's bigger and more marquee than Salesforce,"" Samana told ""Squawk Box.""   Microsoft has placed increased emphasis on cloud computing during CEO Satya Nadella's tenure. The company reported last month that its cloud business grew 106 percent year over year in its most recent full quarter.    Nadella last week projected that Microsoft could hit $20 billion in cloud revenue by 2018, a leap from the current annualized rate of $6.3 billion.   Read More IBM and Facebook in marketing partnership   ""Satya Nadella, he has a vision for the cloud,"" Samana said. ""They've given analysts a peg out there, and what better way to get there than acquiring Salesforce.com, which would make them an even more robust enterprise application provider?""   The acquisition would also block Amazon, the dominant player in cloud computing infrastructure, from consolidating its lead through a purchase of Salesforce.com's platform.   Trading in Salesforce was briefly halted around 3 p.m. EDT Tuesday with the stock up 6 percent after Bloomberg reported that the software giant was evaluating a bid. Another company previously approached Salesforce about a potential bid, the news service said, citing sources.  Benioff may not necessarily be ready to sell the company he founded, Samana said.    ""I think Marc Benioff has a vision of what he wants to accomplish, and I don't think he's quite done cementing what he wants to do,"" Samana said.   Salesforce has a market cap of about $48 billion, compared with Microsoft's roughly $385 billion. In December, the companies tightened their partnership, making it easier to use Salesforce on Windows Mobile phones and in Office.    That close relationship, as well as Benioff's focus on customer experience, could influence his decision on whether to accept a deal, Samana said.   ""If they can be more productive and more valuable with his customers being with Microsoft and more tightly integrated, I think it's something he would certainly consider because at the end of the day, they're a customer company,"" he said.  Salesforce shares ended Tuesday up 1.6 percent, while Microsoft fell 1.3 percent. Shares of Salesforce were up more than 1.5 2 percent in premarket trading Wednesday. (Click here for Salesforce's latest price.) Disclosure: Samana and Sherlund do not own shares of Salesforce.com. FBR Capital Markets holds greater than a 1 percent share in the stock.

815,2015-05-05T08:29:04-0400,"  Microsoft is flipping the bird at its users.   The U.S. tech giant will include support for a middle finger emoji on the Windows 10 operating system for mobile and desktop computers when it is released later this year, according to emoji website Emojipedia.   This means Microsoft could beat both Google's Android and Apple's  iOS to become the first to include the rude gesture in its range of emoji—symbols used in electronic messages. And to ensure diversity when giving someone the finger, Microsoft's emoji comes in different skin tones.    The middle finger symbol has actually been available since last year, following a Unicode update. Unicode makes sure text appears the same across different operating systems and platforms and is behind the language of emoji.     But it is up to companies such as Apple or Google to update their own software to include new emoji so they can be used and viewed. For example, if someone sends you a message with an emoji from an iPhone, you may not be able to view it on a Windows device if that particularly symbol is not supported.    In the latest updates of iOS and Android earlier this year, Apple and Google added a number of new emoji but the middle finger did not feature.    Microsoft is also making several other changes to its emoji in the first update of the symbols since Windows 8.1 was released in October 2013.    As a result, soon Windows users will be able to insult each other without having to use the dubious smiling turd emoji."
816,2015-05-08T07:22:23-0400," Microsoft currently is not weighing an offer for Salesforce.com, two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday, dampening speculation that Microsoft could be drawn into bidding for the cloud software company.   Bloomberg News, citing people with knowledge of the matter, reported earlier this week that Microsoft was evaluating a bid for Salesforce after the latter was approached by another unnamed would-be buyer.   Microsoft considers Salesforce's current market valuation expensive, one of the people said. It is possible that Microsoft could review a bid for Salesforce in the long term, the other person said. Read MoreCan Microsoft make a smartphone comeback?   The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.   Microsoft and Salesforce both declined to comment.    San Francisco-based Salesforce is No. 1 in the $23 billion-a-year customer relationship management (CRM) market, according to tech research firm Gartner. It helps corporations organize and track sales calls and leads.   Salesforce's services are entirely provided over the cloud, with no software directly installed on PCs. Oracle and Microsoft, which were relatively late to the cloud model, have much smaller online CRM revenues.   As a result, Microsoft and several other big software companies are seeking to beef up their presence in cloud computing. Read MoreMicrosoft buying spree continues with acquisition  Yet any deal for Salesforce, which has a market capitalization of $49 billion, would be pricey. Salesforce's shares, which have risen 48 percent in the last 12 months, trade at 106.8 times the company's forward earnings, well above Microsoft's multiple of 19.1, according to Thomson Reuters data.   Last month, Oracle Chief Executive Safra Catz said her company could benefit if Microsoft or another rival bought Salesforce.com.    ""It would cause a lot of disruption in that market and so I would view that as something that would be helpful to us, especially in the short or medium term, dependent on who it was,"" Catz said. She declined to comment on whether Oracle had made an approach to buy Salesforce.    Another potential buyer for Salesforce has ruled itself out. SAP Chief Executive Bill McDermott said earlier this week his company has ""zero interest"" in its software rival.   ""We have never bought something that was impaired and in decline,"" he said, saying that Salesforce's cloud computing software was becoming commoditized. "
817,2015-05-06T10:03:08-0400,"  Since fielding a recent overture from another major technology company, Salesforce.com executives have spent recent days evaluating their two clearest options—pursuing a sale to another company or remaining independent, according to a person familiar with their thinking.   In the course of those conversations, this person added, Microsoft appears the most likely candidate to potentially purchase Salesforce, the leading client relationship management company based in San Francisco. But Microsoft is only one of the names on a short list of competitors that Salesforce believes to be interested in a potential deal, this person said, and other bids may well emerge. (Oracle has also been mentioned as a possible buyer.) Read More'Doubtful' Microsoft will buy Salesforce: Analysts   Word of the as-yet unidentified initial bidder and the possibility of a future overture from Microsoft were first reported by Bloomberg.   As it considers the possibility of selling itself to a competitor, Salesforce is also debating whether a sale even makes sense, the person familiar with the company's thinking said. Remaining independent may prove to be a more attractive option, this person added, so how to mount an effective defense against an unwanted purchase proposal is also a consideration.   A spokesman for Salesforce said on Monday that the comment doesn't comment on rumors or speculation. A spokesperson for Microsoft declined to comment.

818,2015-05-08T06:46:59-0400,"  It's been over a year since Microsoft unveiled their last flagship smartphone – the Lumia 930. In the high-end handset world, that's a long time.   In that period, Apple launched its iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, Samsung's Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge came to market, and the Asian players continue to make tracks.    But a leak on  technology website Unleash the Phones this week suggested that the U.S. technology giant could have two premium devices on the way, one with a 5.7 inch screen and the other with a 5.2 inch display. Both will boast a 20 megapixel camera.    Microsoft declined to comment on the leaks.   However, after waiting so long and after so many big changes in the smartphone market, are the doors closed to Microsoft?  ""The doors to high-end smartphone are shut to everyone apart from Apple and Samsung. There are breadcrumbs left for everyone else and it's a particular challenging for Microsoft because they are kind of background noise in the context of the global market,"" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC by phone.  Microsoft has released a slew of low-to-mid-end smartphones in the year since its last flagship phone was launched but the company does not appear to have given up on the high-end sector. Earlier this year, Stephen Elop, head of Microsoft's devices business, said the U.S. technology giant would release a device when its much-anticipated Windows 10 is launched.    An exact date for the operating system has not been revealed, but Microsoft is betting big on it, pushing what it calls ""Universal Apps"" – a feature that allows app developers to write one code to run across all Windows devices. The hope is to increase the amount of apps on the platform and attract more users.   Microsoft has struggled in the smartphone space even after buying Nokia's devices business last year. The Windows operating system has a 3 percent global market share on mobile, way behind Apple's iOS and Google Android, according to research firm Strategy Analytics.   Last week, Microsoft released tools to make it easier for Google Android and Apple iOS developers to make their apps available for Windows phones as well, to boost the appeal to more developers and consumers. But after waiting so long for a phone release, Microsoft will face an uphill battle, analysts said.  ""The window of opportunity for Windows 10 is closing fast,"" Neil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics, told CNBC phone.    ""The install base of Microsoft devices is not big enough to attract developers, and because of not enough apps they can't attract a big enough user base. They are caught between a rock and a hard place.""  So how exactly will Microsoft turn around its devices business in the face of stiff competition? It all hangs on the launch of Windows 10, analysts said.   The company's chief executive, Satya Nadella, has previously said that Microsoft hardware has to be designed to showcase the best of Windows. The Surface range of tablets has gone some way to do that, fusing laptop and tablet.    Ian Fogg, head of mobile at IHS, said that launching innovative hardware with the release of Windows 10 will be key, given that it's Microsoft's first big operating system release in two years.   ""I think Windows 10 is in essence going to be a re-launch for Microsoft with the smartphone strategy. It's the first major release of Windows the Nokia deal closed,"" Fogg told CNBC by phone.   ""What I would hope Microsoft will do is use the opportunity of the Windows 10 launch to launch some very innovative new hardware that ties into features on Windows 10."" "
819,2015-05-06T15:43:34-0400,"  It would be a terrible strategic mistake for Microsoft to acquire Salesforce, Roger McNamee, the co-founder of Elevation Partners, said on Wednesday.      ""If I were a shareholder of Microsoft, I would be sending a note to the board of directors going, 'Please do not do this,' "" McNamee said.    Salesforce, which has a market capitalization of $48.7 billion, is already too big. Microsoft should be building in house instead of acquiring a company such as Salesforce, said McNamee during CNBC's ""Squawk Alley.""   ""They should be building things internally, and they have lots of opportunities to do that,"" said McNamee.   Read More Here's why Microsoft could buy Salesforce To Microsoft, Salesforce's culture might be more appealing than the products. Yet, since Microsoft isn't looking for a new CEO, the company is certain not to benefit from the culture built by Marc Benioff.   ""I think in fact a large number of people would leave right away and they'd have all the products and the products would be of some value, but I don't think you can justify 50 or more billion dollars to acquire a company at that stage,"" said McNamee."
820,2015-05-01T15:25:58-0400,"  Microsoft has signed a deal to buy the ""technology and talent"" of Israeli touch screen technology firm N-trig, the company confirmed on Friday.    The deal will involve the U.S. computer giant buying N-Trig's stylus pen and touch-screen technology.   The Israeli company's technology is already used in Microsoft's Surface Pro 3 tablet and could be used with other devices.    Microsoft already has a 6.08 percent stake in N-trig, which filed a prospectus for an initial public offering on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange last year.    N-trig's employees will remain in the company's Kfar Saba, Israel, facility, but a source with direct knowledge of the situation said that eventually some could relocate to Microsoft's Redmond, Washington, headquarters.    The deal is a continuation of Microsoft's recent buying spree and marks the third acquisition of an Israeli company in six months, following cybersecurity company Aorato last year and text analytics firm Equivio in January.    Microsoft has been gearing up for the release of the hotly anticipated Windows 10 operating system and many of the acquisitions made over the past year have tied in with that. The acquisition of calendar app Sunrise earlier this year, for example, highlights Microsoft's push to market Windows 10 as an operating system optimized for business across mobile.  "
821,2015-04-30T07:22:30-0400,"  Microsoft has released tools to make it easier for Google Android and Apple iOS developers to make their apps available for Windows phones as well, in a bid to turn around its struggling smartphone unit.   Windows phones have struggled to gain any significant market share, resulting in a lack of developer support and available apps. Now, Microsoft hopes to change this, announcing the news at its developer conference Build in San Francisco.    Normally, developers would have to write separate codes for iOS, Android and Windows Apps. However, the toolkit released by Microsoft on Thursday should allow developers on rival platforms to create a Windows version of their app with ""minimal code modifications.""    The apps would then be distributed through Windows' own app store.   For instance, if a developer were to make a Windows' version of an Android app, it would use Microsoft's own services for search, such as Bing, rather than Google's search function.   Microsoft has traditionally kept its platforms fairly closed, but the change of tack is an attempt to catch up in the fiercely competitive smartphone market.    ""It is a sign of weakness from Microsoft that they have to take the step and put their resources into developer tools that allows developers to port apps to Windows, rather than spending that on adding new features on Windows itself,"" Ian Fogg, head of mobile at research company IHS, told CNBC.    ""Microsoft is now in exactly the same kind of position as those challenger platforms were in the 90s when it was dominant in the PC market.""   Developers will still need to modify any iOS and Android apps and this could hinder any spike in developers rushing to the Windows platform, Fogg added.   ""They have reduced that barrier but there is a still a very significant barrier,"" he said.  Microsoft is set to unveil the hotly-anticipated Windows 10 later this year. At Build, CEO Satya Nadella hailed it as the ""Windows built for this era of more personal computing.""    The ability to write one code for Windows 10 apps and scale them across all devices running the operating system has been touted by Nadella as one of its best features.   At Build, Microsoft demonstrated how the so-called ""Universal Apps"" could be integrated with products such as Cortana—Microsoft's version of Apple personal-assistant software Siri—or the Xbox games console.Read MoreMicrosoft under Nadella aims for cloud and mobile  ""We believe Windows 10 could be a potential game changer for the company as it looks to emulate the success of transitioning Office to a mobile/cloud world, by creating a tightly woven integrated ecosystem with its ubiquitous operating system across devices,"" Daniel Ives, analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said in a research note.    More announcements around Windows 10 are expected during the Build conference, which will run until Friday.   The company has also unveiled its new web browser, Microsoft Edge, which will replace Internet Explorer on Windows 10.  "
822,2015-04-29T11:08:51-0400,"  Wednesday morning in San Francisco, at Microsoft's annual ""Build"" developer conference, CEO Satya Nadella will make the case that companies should focus their engineering resources on the tech giant's platforms such as Windows and Azure. If Nadella doesn't win over the roughly 5,000 attendees, then these developers could instead choose to write applications for rivals. There's billions of dollars on the line in an explosively growing market.  For example, just last week, Amazon  reported that Amazon Web Services–its cloud business–is worth $5 billion and boasts better margins than analysts had expected.   Oracle is also swinging for Microsoft's business. Larry Ellison's company says its cloud revenue is already above a $2 billion run rate.   On the mobile front, Nadella will tout the advantages of Windows 10, the new version of its operating system.   The appeal for developers is that Windows 10 is a unified, single operating system that works across smartphones, tablets and PCs.   Financial analysts covering Microsoft hope to hear on Wednesday more about Windows 10, including monetization plans, the product road map for key enterprise servers and services, and what Nadella's intentions are for the next phase in cloud services.

824,2015-07-21T17:39:00-0400," Check out the companies making headlines after the bell Tuesday:  Apple shares tanked about 7 percent after the iPhone beat earnings expectations, but only by a small margin. The tech giant reported third-quarter profit of $1.85 a share on revenue of $49.61 billion. Wall Street was looking for profit of $1.81 per share on $49.43 billion.   Shares of wearable camera maker GoPro declined, although the company beat expectations—sales surged more than 71.7 percent from a year ago. However, the stock swung higher after it issued strong revenue and profit guidance during its earnings call. The stock was last up about 3 percent.   Microsoft beat on the top and bottom lines, but the Windows maker took a hit from restructuring charges and low demand for core offerings.    Yahoo's stock slipped more than 1 percent after the Internet giant missed earnings projections although sales beat. The company forecast third-quarter revenue that was below average estimates.    Restaurant operator Chipotle Mexican Grill reported higher-than-expected earnings, but revenue trailed Street projections, sending the stock down as much as 4 percent in extended trading. Comparable-store sales also came in below estimates, growing just 4.3 percent, versus expectations of for a rise of 5.7 percent. The stock turned positive after it said the company told investors on its earnings call that it expects slightly better sales in July.     Zillow, the online real estate provider, said current shareholders of class A and class B shares will receive two shares of its newly created class C capital stock. Zillow will issue the dividend on August 14. The non-voting C shares will trade under the ticker symbol ""Z"" and the Class A common stock will trade under the ticker symbol ""ZG.""

He noted that Office 365 has 50 million active monthly users, while 50 trillion objects are stored in Azure.   Revenue in the company's devices and consumer segment floated 8 percent higher year-over-year. Sales of Surface tablets rose 44 percent from the previous year to $713 million, while advertising revenue in the company's Bing search engine grew 21 percent.  Xbox Live video game usage also climbed 30 percent year-over-year.   Microsoft's phone unit, which it has integrated since completing an acquisition of Nokia's device business last year, accounted for $1.4 billion in revenue on 8.6 Lumia units sold in the quarter. The technology company cited the continued inclusion of Nokia as part of its $190 million in restructuring expenses for the quarter.    It also said a strengthening U.S. dollar against key global currencies had a ""significant impact"" on business in the quarter.    The stock has slipped 7 percent this year.  "
826,2015-04-24T10:04:57-0400,"  To combat the strong dollar, Microsoft engaged in about $15 billion in currency hedging in the latest quarter, longtime Microsoft analyst Rick Sherlund said Friday.   ""That's the gross value to protect against currency moves,"" said Nomura Securities' managing director, who made his calculations based on Microsoft filings.   The strengthening dollar was a 3 percent drag on the top and bottom lines in the quarter ended in March. But the tech giant, after the market closed Thursday, reported earnings and revenue that beat expectations.   ""It was [a] less bad quarter. But they set expectations low enough that the Street was happy with the results,"" Sherlund told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" after upgrading the stock to a buy with a $50 price target.

""The business is in transition to the cloud. They are now the world's biggest cloud vendor at $7.1 billion in annualized revenues, growing over 100 percent per year,"" Sherlund said. ""But it's still small, about 8 percent of the [overall] business.""   ""It's unhooking from Windows and trying to let Office be the next platform for innovation of productivity,"" he continued. ""The Windows business is about 30 percent of earnings and that's in a secular decline.""   Sales of Windows software to computer manufacturers to install on new PCs fell 19 percent for the quarter.   Going forward, the Nomura analyst sees tough comparisons for Microsoft in the next two quarters. ""Last year, PC sales picked up because people were upgrading. There was an end of life of Windows XP, the older operating system.""   Microsoft is going aggressively after the cloud, a business that's also big for Amazon.

827,2015-04-21T13:46:00-0400,"  Last time Microsoft reported earnings, the stock had its biggest one-day plunge in over 18 months. But as the tech giant gears up to report results on Thursday, some are betting that the worst is behind it.    On Monday, when options volume was about 2½ times its daily average, a trader made a very large purchase of call options expiring in May. Specifically, the trader bought 25,000 contracts of the May 44-strike calls for 47 cents each.    But according to Dan Nathan, co-founder of RiskReversal.com, there's more than meets the eye on this particular trade.    ""These were marked closing,"" said Nathan, who noted that the trader was getting out of an existing position, not taking on a new bet. When traders buy calls, they are making bullish bets. But when they sell calls short, they are taking a bearish position.  Read MoreYahoo, Microsoft add termination clause in search deal - filing According to Nathan's analysis, the trader likely closed those calls in anticipation that the stock could rally, which would incur financial losses to anyone short calls.  Technical analysis may also have had a hand in how the trader is now positioned. When the stock sold off three months ago, its chart made a gap from its Jan. 26 low of $46.24 to its Jan. 27 high of $43.20.    Shares subsequently bounced from support around the $40 level. Nathan speculates that the trader is expecting Microsoft stock to make the classic technical move of ""filling the gap"" it made in January. In other words, one options trader is betting Microsoft might reclaim all its post-earnings losses.    ""The gap from earnings back in January was 9 percent,"" said Nathan. ""It was an eye-popping move. So possibly this long holder who covered those calls does not want to cap their upside into Thursday's earnings."" "
828,2007-10-24T17:19:29-0400,"We now have a definitive agreement: Microsoft   gets a stake in Facebook for $240 million, and now valuing the company at $15 billion. For a company that will do $30 million in profits on $150 million in revenue, that's a nifty valuation!And I'm surprised as you can tell from my previous blog post, along with a lot of Wall Street. “We are pleased to take our Microsoft partnership to the next level,” said Owen Van Natta, vice president of operations and chief revenue officer at Facebook, in a press release announcing the deal. “We think this expanded relationship will allow Facebook to continue to innovate and grow as a technology leader and major player in social computing, as well as bring relevant advertising to the more than 49 million active users of Facebook.” So now the question will be whether Microsoft is crazy, or merely crazy like a fox?Which brings up an interesting comparison. Microsoft has to be very careful that it doesn't do to Facebook what News Corp did to MySpace. This was a great net property that needed to be ""monetized,"" so News Corp filled MySpace with ads, and the site lost its ""coolness"" factor and the kids have abandoned it. “Making this investment and expanding this partnership will position Microsoft and Facebook to better take advantage of advertising opportunities around the world, and is a great win for not only for our two companies, but also our collective users and advertisers,” said Kevin Johnson, president of the Platforms &amp; Services Division at Microsoft, in a release. “We have partnered well over the past year and look forward to doing some exciting things together in the future. The opportunity to further collaborate as advertising partners is a big reason we have decided to take an equity stake, and is a strong statement of our confidence in the long-term economics of this partnership.” Facebook now runs the risk of becoming Microsoft's financial flavor of the month. But with the deal, Microsoft captures a coolness factor all its own and can establish a ""relevance"" in the online world, Pacific Crest's Brendan Barnicle just told me. But he's not sold on the idea that this is the right deal at the right time. Facebook could blossom into something big, but Microsoft appears to be paying through the nose on that gamble and it may turn into nothing at all. At least the company finally beat Google on a deal, or so it seems. And that might be worth a ""coolness"" and ""relevance"" factor all its own. Questions?  Comments?  TechCheck@cnbc.com"
829,2009-01-21T18:18:54-0500,"Microsoft stock has hardly moved in months. Will it finally pop after earnings, Thursday?As you may know, the traders have been mostly bullish on Microsoft over the past several months, partly because of its strong balance sheet. With the firm due to release Q2 earnings on Thursday after the bell, what can you expect? As you can see from the chart, the stock has been stuck in a range since November. How should you trade?UBS analyst Heather Bellini tells us she thinks Microsoft is a trading buy ahead of earnings. “It’s a better house in a bad neighborhood” she says, “but I do think you could get some alpha if you’re long it for the print.” For those of you looking for a longer-term trade, you might like knowing Bellini has a buy on the stock with a 12-month price target of $30.And in case you’re wondering, Bellini thinks ultimately they need to do a deal with Yahoo! “and I do think it will happen eventually,” she says.However, it's worth noting that opinions on Microsoft vary widely. Some analysts say Microsoft's clients have cut back on IT spending due to the weak economy and as a result the software giant will probably fall short of its revenue and EPS targets.On average, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters are looking for profit of 49 cents per share on revenue of $17.08 billion.What do you think?

831,2018-12-20T13:26:44-0500,"The Nasdaq Composite entered bear market territory Thursday as Wall Street sold off pricey technology stocks amid steep valuations, increased regulatory concerns and fears of slowing economic growth.The tech-heavy benchmark lost nearly 3 percent at its low of the day, bringing its losses to more than 20 percent from a record reached at the end of August. It finished the day just under that level, down 1.6 percent for the day and 19.7 percent from its record.Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Alphabet, which drove the gains in the Nasdaq during the bull market, were all lower on Thursday. Those names are all already in bear market territory individually, down more than 20 percent from highs.Apple is down 32 percent from its latest high. Amazon is off by 29 percent from its record. At their peaks, both were worth more than $1 trillion in market value. On Thursday, both lost more than 2 percent.Even Microsoft, which had held up better than other big tech recently, was getting hit on Thursday. The stock was down 2 percent, bringing its decline from its 52-week high to 12 percent.""It's been a bear market for a little while now, whether it's been reflected in Russell 2000 or the Nasdaq,"" said Steven DeSanctis, a Jefferies equity strategist. ""We've seen sectors like energy, financials and some consumer names that have been absolutely beaten up. It's pretty broad-based.""Investors were quick to abandon the tech household names in part thanks to how expensive technology stocks had become over the past year. Traders bought up such stocks throughout 2017 and into 2018 amid a swell in demand for chips and an acceleration in revenues at Facebook and Amazon that promised companies some of the best advertising exposure available.But an uptick in borrowing costs and heightened regulatory scrutiny has trimmed the buoyant income outlook for the sector, which often borrows cash to fuel innovation or content purchasing. Facebook stock, for instance, fell more than 30 percent over the past six months as a string of data privacy reports and subsequent federal hearings threw the social media giant into the limelight. Facebook actually finished Thursday higher, but is down 38 percent from its 52-week high.""People are really worried about 2019 outlook and what earnings numbers are going to be,"" DeSanctis added. ""Earnings numbers are coming down for 2019. Companies are able to manage around higher interest rates, which slow down their business, but the tariffs add an additional cost. So companies are really going to take a step back and not spend a lot of money initially in 2019.""Apple also faced revenue concerns this quarter after it told investors that it will no longer disclose iPhone unit sales when it reports financial results, raising fears that sales of the iconic smartphone may have peaked. Many analysts and shareholders, who had used the quarterly phone sales figures as a quick gauge of the company's income health, said they were disappointed with Apple's choice to withhold the information.Chipmakers saw their equity soar in 2017 as retail investors flocked to cryptocurrency investments and developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning and autonomous driving promised long-lasting demand for semiconductors and equipment.Stock of Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are both off more than 40 percent from their own 52-week highs and were lower on Thursday.— CNBC's Yun Li contributed reporting."

833,2008-04-09T22:22:10-0400,"Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is in talks with Microsoft about joining in its contested bid for Yahoo, according to people involved in the discussions. The combination, which would join Yahoo, Microsoft’s MSN and News Corporation’s MySpace, would create a behemoth that would upend the Internet landscape.Yahoo has resisted Microsoft’s overtures, contending that it will not negotiate unless Microsoft raises its offer. Yahoo, which wants to remain independent, has been in a desperate search for white knights, holding conversations with Time Warner's AOL and News Corporation . If News Corporation throws its weight behind Microsoft’s offer, that could allow Microsoft to raise its bid, putting even more pressure on Yahoo and its shareholders. At the same time, the alignment of Microsoft and News Corporation would remove a possible alternative for Yahoo, leaving it with fewer opportunities to escape Microsoft’s grasp.The talks between Microsoft and News Corporation are at a sensitive stage, people involved in the discussions said. “There’s a long way to go before anything is definite,” one person involved in the talks said.A Microsoft spokesman said he could not immediately comment. A spokesman for Yahoo declined to comment. A News Corporation spokesman said the company did not comment on “speculation.”It is also possible that News Corporation could still participate in a deal with Yahoo on its own, though the disclosure of its talks with Microsoft may complicate that relationship.Terms of the proposed union are still being worked out, these people said, and remain murky. News Corporation would probably contribute its Fox Interactive Media unit, which includes MySpace, and possibly cash to a partnership with Microsoft as part of an acquisition of Yahoo, they said. The talks represent a change of sides for Mr. Murdoch. Just days after Microsoft made its bid, he flew to the West Coast and had dinner with Jerry Yang, Yahoo’s chief executive, offering his assistance in fending off Microsoft. A deal between them would have involved joining forces with Google to use its lucrative advertising system on the companies’ sites. Antitrust concerns have, however, all but scuttled those talks, at least in that form.On Wednesday, Yahoo suggested that it might be willing to cede part of its core business to Google, an archrival, to remain independent.Yahoo said it would begin outsourcing a small portion of its search advertising to Google. The limited test is meant to determine whether the company could extract more revenue if Google ran its search advertising system. The test results might also back Yahoo’s contention that Microsoft’s offer undervalues the company, a person briefed on the plan said. In the two-week test, Yahoo will use Google’s search advertising system to deliver ads that appear alongside Yahoo’s search results. The test will involve searches conducted in the United States on Yahoo.com, not on any of the company’s search affiliates, and will be limited to no more than 3 percent of all search queries, Yahoo said in a statement. Yahoo also said there was no guarantee that the test would lead to a broader deal.Microsoft immediately blasted the idea of a search advertising partnership between Yahoo and Google, saying it would be anticompetitive. “Any definitive agreement between Yahoo and Google would consolidate over 90 percent of the search advertising market in Google’s hands,” Microsoft said in a statement. In Washington, Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, also warned about the potential anticompetitive implications. “We will be following closely the results of the short-term test alliance between Yahoo and Google,” Mr. Kohl said in a statement. He had previously raised concerns about a Microsoft-Yahoo combination. Yahoo’s board is expected to meet this week to discuss its options.For Yahoo, the idea of outsourcing its search advertising system to Google is not new. Investors and some executives inside the company have long recommended that it do so, as it could help the company increase revenue and cut costs.Yahoo executives have resisted the outsourcing idea, saying that search and search advertising are essential pieces of the company’s business. Yet in a presentation to investors last month, Yahoo estimated that Google’s search advertising generated 60 percent to 70 percent more revenue on average than Yahoo’s.Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, also offered his assistance to Yahoo soon after Microsoft announced its offer. Executives from the two companies held talks to discuss, among other things, a search advertising partnership, but those talks cooled. The talks appeared to have heated up again recently. Mr. Yang and Yahoo’s president, Susan Decker, visited Google in the last two weeks, said a person briefed on their visit.In recent months, Yahoo has also been discussing a possible partnership with AOL, people involved in the talks said, but no deal is imminent. Such an agreement would not exclude a search advertising partnership with Google, these people said. The advertising test may be a way for Yahoo to show Microsoft that it still has alternatives, said Carl W. Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia. “But if this were to go forward as a full proposal, there would be some serious concerns in the antitrust area,” Professor Tobias said. -- Saul Hansell contributed to this report."
834,2015-03-25T16:21:38-0400," Microsoft said Wednesday that it plans to make the core viewing and editing features of Office free for devices with screens of 10.1-inches or smaller.   That will bring the Windows side of things more in line with what the software maker has done with its recent Office releases for iOS and Android, where most core features are free, with some advanced features requiring an Office 365 subscription.   ""Based on our research, we are classifying anything with a screen size of 10.1 inches or less as a true mobile device: You're probably using it on the go, when it's not practical to use a larger computing device such as a PC or a Mac. You probably aren't using a mouse or a keyboard, instead navigating via touch interface,"" Microsoft corporate VP Kirk Koenigsbauer said in a blog post.

Both versions are due later this year.   Microsoft, which has historically made most of its profit from Office and Windows, has been increasingly willing to offer its core products for free in areas where the company has smaller market share, such as phones and tablets.

835,2018-12-20T07:45:40-0500,"Facebook has a common line of defense in response to persistent concerns over how it handles user data: We did it with permission.The problem, experts say, is that many users don't realize they are giving permission.One issue for both users and companies like Facebook is defining consent in the first place.The saying goes: ask for forgiveness, not permission.But when it comes to Facebook there's a common line of defense in response to persistent concerns over how it handles user data: We did it with permission.After the New York Times reported Facebook gave tech companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix special access to user data, including the ability to see private messages, the social media company answered ""none of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people's permission.""The problem, experts say, is that many users don't realize they are giving permission at all.""While it is true that some data sharing would have been expected by consumers, much of what was described in the reporting would not reasonably have been expected,"" said Brian Wieser, senior research analyst covering Facebook at Pivotal Research Group, in a note published Wednesday.A 2017 Deloitte survey of 2,000 U.S. consumers found 91 percent of respondents willingly accept legal terms and conditions without reading them before installing apps, registering Wi-Fi hotspots, accepting updates and signing into online services such as video streaming. That percentage increased to 97 percent among 18 to 34-year-olds.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg admitted he knows this in an exchange with Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson in a Senate hearing in April:JOHNSON: Do you have any idea how many of your users actually read the terms of service, the privacy policy, the statement of rights and responsibilities? I mean, actually read it?ZUCKERBERG: Senator, I do not.JOHNSON: Would you imagine it's a very small percentage?ZUCKERBERG: Senator, who read the whole thing? I would imagine that probably most people do not read the whole thing. But everyone has the opportunity to and consents to it.One of the problems for both users and companies like Facebook is defining consent in the first place.Michael Veale, a researcher in the science, technology, engineering and public policy of University College London, told CNBC Thursday consent in the U.S. is often based on a one-time approval of a company's terms and conditions. But he said the U.S. is moving in the direction of more European-style regulation.In May, a sweeping set of data privacy rules went into effect in Europe. Called the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it defines consent as a ""freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication … by a statement or by a clear affirmative action.""Veale said terms and conditions are a ""red herring"" for EU regulators looking for companies that are trying to collect extra personal data.""Consent in the GDPR is not a take it or leave it question,"" he said.Facebook has already been accused of violating a consent decree it reached in 2011 with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over its handling of the Cambridge Analytica data leak, and the latest revelations in the New York Times could put the company in the crosshairs of the FTC again. The FTC agreement requires Facebook users to give permission before the company can share personal data beyond the privacy settings they have already established. Facebook said its partner agreements did not violate the FTC settlement."

The rebranding is a part of its upcoming Windows 10 software overhaul. Internet Explorer will still be available, but the new browser, which goes by the tentative code name Project Spartan, will become the default browser for Windows 10 users, according to a Microsoft representative.  Introducing a new browser brand is almost a necessity for Microsoft, S&amp;P Capital IQ analyst Angelo Zino said in an interview Tuesday with CNBC.

838,2015-03-13T07:14:17-0400," Microsoft is working on an advanced version of its competitor to Apple's Siri, using research from an artificial intelligence project called ""Einstein.""   Microsoft has been running its ""personal assistant"" Cortana on its Windows phones for a year, and will put the new version on the desktop with the arrival of Windows 10 this autumn. Later, Cortana will be available as a standalone app, usable on phones and tablets powered by Apple's iOS and Google's Android, people familiar with the project said. Read MoreMicrosoft wants Google's crown in wearables  ""This kind of technology, which can read and understand email, will play a central role in the next roll out of Cortana, which we are working on now for the fall time frame,"" said Eric Horvitz, managing director of Microsoft Research and a part of the Einstein project, in an interview at the company's Redmond, Washington, headquarters.   The plan to put Cortana on machines running software from rivals such as Apple and Google, as well as the Einstein project, have not been reported. Cortana is the name of an artificial intelligence character in the video game series ""Halo.""   They represent a new front in CEO Satya Nadella's battle to sell Microsoft software on any device or platform, rather than trying to force customers to use Windows. Success on rivals' platforms could create new markets and greater relevance for the company best known for its decades-old operating system.   The concept of 'artificial intelligence' is broad, and mobile phones and computers already show dexterity with spoken language and sifting through emails for data, for instance.  Read MoreUniting with rivals?Welcome to the new Microsoft   Still, Microsoft believes its work on speech recognition, search and machine learning will let it transform its digital assistant into the first intelligent 'agent' which anticipates users needs. By comparison, Siri is advertised mostly as responding to requests. Google's mobile app, which doesn't have a name like Siri or Cortana, already offers some limited predictive information 'cards' based on what it thinks the user wants to know.   Microsoft has tried to create digital assistants before, without success. Microsoft Bob, released in 1995, was supposed to make using a computer easy, but ended up being the butt of jokes. The Office Assistant nicknamed 'Clippy' suffered a similar fate a few years later.    ""We're defining the competitive landscape... of who can provide the most supportive services that make life easier, keep track of things, that complement human memory in a way that helps us get things done,"" said Horvitz.   Outside his door stands ""The Assistant,"" a monitor showing a woman's face that can converse with visitors, has access to Horvitz's calendar and can book meetings.  Read MoreMicrosoft unveils new smartphones with free Office   On his desktop, Horvitz runs 'Lifebrowser,' a program that stores everything from appointments to photos and uses machine learning to identify the important moments. A keyword search for his university professor instantly brings up photos and video from the last time they met. Cortana could tell a mobile phone user when to leave for the airport, days after it read an email and realized the user was planning a flight. It would automatically check flight status, determine where the phone is located using GPS, and checking traffic conditions.   None of the individual steps are a breakthrough, but creating an artificial intelligence that can stitch together the processes marks a breakthrough in usefulness, Microsoft says.   Rivals are on the same track. Google's latest mobile app uses the predictive power generated from billions of searches to work out what a user is doing, what they are interested in, and sending relevant information, such as when a favorite sports team is playing next.   Apple is also pushing Siri, which uses Microsoft's Bing search engine in the background, into new areas with its CarPlay and HomeKit platforms, as well as the recently unveiled Apple Watch.   The key to Cortana's success will be knowing where a user is, what time it is, and what they are trying to do. Albert Einstein's work on the relationship between space and time gave rise to Microsoft's secret project name, said Horvitz.   ""Einstein was brilliant about space and time,"" he said. ""It's using brilliance about space and time generally in our agents."" "
839,2015-03-16T10:09:41-0400,"  Amazon and Microsoft are ""friends"" not rivals of Alibaba in the cloud computing space, a top exec at the Chinese e-commerce giant told CNBC.  The comments come just a few days after Alibaba opened a data center in Silicon Valley—its first on U.S. turf in a cloud market dominated by Amazon, Google and Microsoft.  But Ethan Yu, the international head of Alibaba's cloud division, Aliyun, told CNBC that the company was not in competition with its U.S. counterparts.  ""The public cloud business is growing exponentially. There is just huge room for everyone to grow. We are trying to position differently from our friends in this area. We would not call them competitors,"" Yu said in an interview at tech trade fair CeBit, in Hanover, Germany.  Alibaba's cloud computing business accounts for just 1 percent of the company's total revenue, brining in $58 million for the New York-listed technology giant in the three months to December, according to a results filing. This represented 85 percent year-on-year growth in the division, highlighting the rapid expansion of cloud services for Alibaba.  Alibaba has four data centers in China, one in Hong Kong, and one in the U.S. Yu would not reveal where the next one would open but said the company had its eye on the American market.   ""The U.S. customer is one of the customers that we pay great attention to. The physical location of customers does not matter, what matters is where exactly our customers put their servers to service their own customers,"" Yu told CNBC.    The Silicon Valley data center will allow Chinese companies to get a foothold on U.S. soil, but also let American firms tap customers in the world's second-largest economy.    Similarly to its competitors, Aliyun cloud provides services such as storage space for companies and protection against cyberattacks. Where Yu thinks Aliyun is different is its ability to handle ""big data.""   Yu said Singles' Day in November, China's equivalent of Cyber Monday, showed how Aliyun could process and analyse large swathes of data. In 2014, Alibaba sales topped $9 billion on Singles' Day. Aliyun is the cloud service behind Alibaba's e-commerce platforms such as Taobao and Tmall.  ""This is very key to not only Alibaba as a group, but Aliyun as a business,"" Yu said, adding that Aliyun lets businesses analyze large amounts of data that they ""can't explore with traditional IT systems"".     Alibaba has previously said it would expand Aliyun into Southeast Asia and Europe, but a further push into the U.S. would make sense, according to analysts.    ""I think Alibaba is scaling to be a worldwide player,"" Martin Garner, senior vice president at CCS Insight, told CNBC by phone.    ""When we look at Amazon's cloud growth it is mostly in the U.S. The share of the business outside the U.S. is much smaller so it's understandable Alibaba would go there first."" "
840,2015-03-05T02:52:04-0500,"  Microsoft is betting big on Windows 10, but it's not just smartphones and PCs it wants to conquer.   The U.S. IT giant told CNBC that it wants to dethrone Google's  Android Wear as the top smartwatch operating system of choice for device manufacturers.   ""What is true is that we have architected Windows 10 to work across the broadest range of wearables...This is an architecture scaling from the very small to largest compute jobs,"" Greg Sullivan, marketing director for Windows Phone, told CNBC at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  When asked whether the company was looking to become the go-to smartwatch operating system, Sullivan said: ""In short, yes.""  Read MoreThese phones can stop you being spiedon   Microsoft initially unveiled Windows 10 in September last year and gave further updates in January; it is expected to be officially launched in the second half of this year.    One of its key features is what the company calls its ""Universal App"" platform. This system enables developers to easily create apps which will run across all Windows devices, whether it be a smartphone or PC. Developers normally have to write different codes for different devices.    It means apps could run not only on smartphones, but also on smartwatches and Microsoft's augmented reality goggles, called HoloLens.    Sullivan said the feature would appeal to developers and ultimately help Windows 10 become the most attractive operating system for wearables.   ""We expect the ability to write one app in the Windows 10 timeframe to become a higher priority in the mobile space,"" he added.  The comments come after Microsoft unveiled two budget smartphones on Monday - the 5-inch Lumia 640 and larger, 5.7-inch Lumia 640 XL - but it has not revealed a new flagship phone. The Redmond, WA-based company is expected to release a flagship device once Windows 10 is launched.   Analysts said Microsoft might be playing a risky game by waiting too long to release such a device, but Sullivan dismissed the claims and said the company was committed to high-end models.    ""There is a focus on the flagships and we will certainly be in that space,"" he told CNBC.   But although Microsoft plans to take on Google's Android Wear, it was less clear whether the company was considering manufacturing new wearable devices. Currently, Microsoft has a fitness tracker called the Microsoft Band.    As for a new smartwatch running Windows 10, Sullivan added: ""There are opportunities which we will build on our own hardware and some with our partners."" "
841,2015-03-02T05:58:41-0500," Microsoft has released two budget smartphones with free Office 365 in an effort to tempt users ahead of the launch of Windows 10, but a flagship phone for the software giant remains elusive.    The two devices - the 5-inch Lumia 640 and larger, 5.7-inch Lumia 640 XL – are further low-cost releases by Microsoft as it looks to boost its market share in a fiercely competitive smartphone environment.   The Lumia 640 costs around 159 euros ($178) and the 4G Lumia 640 Xl costs 219 euros, and both will be rolled out globally this month. The phones were unveiled at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Monday.   To attract users, Microsoft is offering its Office 365 suite, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote, free for a year.    ""Microsoft understands it's in a weak position and is leveraging the wider capabilities to support its mobile offering,"" Ian Fogg, head of mobile at IHS, told CNBC by phone. But Fogg warned that the move risked ""devaluing"" Office.   Microsoft said both devices are upgradeable to Windows 10 - its latest operating system, unveiled earlier this year, which is expected to be rolled out across all of the company's devices.    Windows 10 marks a complete overhaul of Microsoft's heavily-criticized predecessor Windows 8, and analysts said a lot is riding on the success of the platform. The operating system will be released later this year, but the exact date is unknown.    It comes as Microsoft continues to struggle in the smartphone space - Windows phones had a market share of just 2.7 percent in 2014, according to IDC.    Analysts expect Microsoft to release a flagship phone when Windows 10 is launched, but Fogg said the company was playing a ""risky"" game by waiting.   ""It signals that Microsoft seems determined to wait for the Windows 10 launch to launch new flagship hardware.That is a risky strategy as it leaves the flagship segment uncontested by Microsoft,"" Fogg told CNBC. - By CNBC's Arjun Kharpal in Barcelona"
842,2015-02-17T14:35:53-0500,"  There may be no more surprising development in technology over the past year than Microsoft's radical transformation into an industry collaborator.   Long surviving on huge license and maintenance fees for its proprietary Windows and Office software, Microsoft historically wanted to sell you the full stack, from the operating system on your desktop to the security, networking and storage in data center servers. It didn't matter if someone else could do it better. Satya Nadella, who succeeded Steve Ballmer as chief executive officer a year ago, is doing the once unthinkable: unbundling. Read MoreMicrosoft's aim to catch Amazon in the cloud  The latest indication of the evolution in Redmond, Wash., came Tuesday, when Microsoft announced mobile integrations with Salesforce.com, Citrix and Box. As part of Microsoft's new Cloud Storage Partner Program, users of Apple  iOS devices can fire up Word, Excel or PowerPoint and pull in documents and data from other cloud providers.    To be clear: This means users of non-Microsoft devices can access data stored by Microsoft competitors and edit and save within Microsoft apps. Box Chief Executive Officer Aaron Levie, who spent years criticizing Microsoft's closed approach and lack of innovation, is now openly championing the software giant.   ""What Microsoft has been doing under Satya's leadership is recognizing that to be incredibly relevant in the next generation of enterprise and consumer, they need to make sure their individual products are able to stand on their own and compete on their own without being propped up by the complete integration of them all,"" Levie said in an interview on Tuesday. ""There's a lot of momentum around them doing these kinds of partnerships and integrations over the past year.""  In November, Microsoft forged a similar arrangement with Dropbox, letting consumers edit and save files from the storage and collaboration service in Office 365. Microsoft is actually easing the way for individuals and teams to use competitive products.  Microsoft is making strides on more than just the consumer side. The company's cloud hosting service Azure, which competes with Amazon Web Services, has partnered with longtime competitors including IBM, Oracle and SAP to sell and support their products.   Levie said the Box integration with Microsoft on iOS is just the beginning. The companies are working to allow files and data from Box to be accessible and editable in Word or PowerPoint from any browser on any device.   Read MoreThe exploding tech sector that puzzles Wall Street  Investors are still waiting to see if Nadella's cultural transformation results in revived growth at Microsoft. The stock is up 15 percent in the past 12 months, just ahead of the gains in the S&amp;P 500.   While commercial cloud revenue, including sales from Office 365 and Azure, jumped 114 percent in the latest quarter from a year earlier, it still represents little more than 5 percent of the overall business. Total revenue rose only 8 percent. Read More  But Nadella is playing the long game, experts note. And his top lieutenants are falling in line. Here's what Kirk Koenigsbauer, a corporate vice president for the Microsoft Office team, wrote in a blog post tied to Tuesday's announcement:   ""Living in a cloud-first, mobile-first world is all about having the flexibility to get things done from anywhere and on any device.""    In the past, that sort of message from Microsoft would have come across as jargony rhetoric. Now, even the critics are taking it seriously. "

844,2018-12-14T09:34:08-0500,"Many people have accepted the narrative that artificial intelligence is an inevitable reality of the future.This narrative is coupled with the idea that technology must ""solve"" for bias in AI. This is an idea that several of the world's largest tech companies have championed.But the quest to ""solve"" for bias in AI distracts from the real question of whether this technology is worth building.This story originally ran on Medium on December 7, 2018.The rise of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook as the world's most valuable companies has been accompanied by two linked narratives about technology. One is about artificial intelligence — the golden promise and hard sell of these companies. A.I. is presented as a potent, pervasive, unstoppable force to solve our biggest problems, even though it's essentially just about finding patterns in vast quantities of data. The second story is that A.I. has a problem: Bias.The tales of bias are legion: Online ads that show men higher-paying jobs; delivery services that skip poor neighborhoods; facial recognition systems that fail people of color; recruitment tools that invisibly filter out women. A problematic self-righteousness surrounds these reports: Through quantification, of course we see the world we already inhabit. Yet each time, there is a sense of shock and awe and a detachment from affected communities in the discovery that systems driven by data about our world replicate and amplify racial, gender, and class inequality.Serious thinkers in academia and business have swarmed to the A.I. bias problem, eager to tweak and improve the data and algorithms that drive artificial intelligence. They've latched onto fairness as the objective, obsessing over competing constructs of the term that can be rendered in measurable, mathematical form. If the hunt for a science of computational fairness was restricted to engineers, it would be one thing. But given our contemporary exaltation and deference to technologists, it has limited the entire imagination of ethics, law and the media as well.There are three problems with this focus on A.I. bias. The first is that addressing bias as a computational problem obscures its root causes. Bias is a social problem, and seeking to solve it within the logic of automation is always going to be inadequate.Second, even apparent success in tackling bias can have perverse consequences. Take the example of a facial recognition system that works poorly on women of color because of the group's underrepresentation both in the training data and among system designers. Alleviating this problem by seeking to ""equalize"" representation merely co-opts designers in perfecting vast instruments of surveillance and classification.Tweet.When underlying systemic issues remain fundamentally untouched, the bias fighters simply render humans more machine readable, exposing minorities in particular to additional harms.Third — and most dangerous and urgent of all — is the way in which the seductive controversy of A.I. bias, and the false allure of ""solving"" it, detracts from bigger, more pressing questions. Bias is real, but it's also a captivating diversion.What has been remarkably underappreciated is the key interdependence of the twin stories of A.I. inevitability and A.I. bias. Against the corporate projection of an otherwise sunny horizon of unstoppable A.I. integration, recognizing and acknowledging bias can be seen as a strategic concession — one that subdues the scale of the challenge. Bias, like job losses and safety hazards, becomes part of the grand bargain of innovation.The reality that bias is primarily a social problem and cannot be fully solved technically becomes a strength, rather than a weakness, for the inevitability narrative. It flips the script. It absorbs and regularizes the classification practices and underlying systems of inequality perpetuated by automation, allowing relative increases in ""fairness"" to be claimed as victories — even if all that is being done is to slice, dice and redistribute the makeup of those negatively affected by actuarial decision-making.In short, the preoccupation with narrow computational puzzles distracts us from the far more important issue of the colossal asymmetry between societal cost and private gain in the rollout of automated systems. It also denies us the possibility of asking: Should we be building these systems at all?In accepting the existing narratives about A.I., vast zones of contest and imagination are relinquished. What is achieved is resignation — the normalization of massive data capture, a one-way transfer to technology companies, and the application of automated, predictive solutions to each and every societal problem.Given this broader political and economic context, it should not surprise us that many prominent voices sounding the alarm on bias do so with blessing and support from the likes of Facebook, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Apple. These convenient critics spotlight important questions, but they also suck attention from longer-term challenges. The endgame is always to ""fix"" A.I. systems, never to use a different system or no system at all.Once we recognize the inherently compromised nature of the A.I. bias debate, it reveals opportunities deserving of sustained policy attention. The first has to be the wholesale giveaway of societal data that undergirds A.I. system development. We are well overdue for a radical reappraisal over who controls the vast troves of data currently locked down by technology incumbents. Our governors and communities should act decisively to disincentivize and devalue data hoarding with creative policies, including carefully defined bans, levies, mandated data sharing, and community benefit policies, all backed up by the brass knuckles of the law. Smarter data policies would reenergize competition and innovation, both of which have unquestionably slowed with the concentrated market power of the tech giants. The greatest opportunities will flow to those who act most boldly.The second great opportunity is to wrestle with fundamental existential questions and to build robust processes for resolving them. Which systems really deserve to be built? Which problems most need to be tackled? Who is best placed to build them? And who decides? We need genuine accountability mechanisms, external to companies and accessible to populations. Any A.I. system that is integrated into people's lives must be capable of contest, account, and redress to citizens and representatives of the public interest. And there must always be the possibility to stop the use of automated systems with appreciable societal costs, just as there is with every other kind of technology.Artificial intelligence evokes a mythical, objective omnipotence, but it is backed by real-world forces of money, power, and data. In service of these forces, we are being spun potent stories that drive toward widespread reliance on regressive, surveillance-based classification systems that enlist us all in an unprecedented societal experiment from which it is difficult to return. Now, more than ever, we need a robust, bold, imaginative response.Julia Powles is a Research Fellow in the Information Law Institute at New York University and a 2018 Poynter Fellow at Yale University.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube."
845,2008-07-18T09:40:26-0400,"Shares ofGoogleand Microsoftfell Friday after the latest earnings reports from the two tech giants cast doubts on the assumption that the two companies are immune to the recent economic downturn. ""Google was claiming to be immune to an economic slowdown - and the most interesting take away from last night’s report is that [Google] finally admitted that the consumer slowdown will impact their business,"" Clayton Moran, a media and communications analyst from Stanford Group, told CNBC. ""Now we’re seeing a broadening of the advertising slowdown and a lot of fears that it will be prolonged,"" Moran said. ""And if Google’s going to be impacted, then that impact will last as long as the slowdown lasts."" (For more from Moran, see the video below.)This is enough to unnerve already jittery investors. Google shares fell $41.88, or 7.8 percent, in early morning trading, pushing Google's stock price below $500 for the first time in three months.  Other tech stocks, including Microsoft were also trading lower. Late Thursday, Microsoft reported earnings of 46 cents a shareand revenue of $15.84 billion. Wall Street was for looking for earnings of 47 cents and revenue of $15.65 billion.  The results prompted Lehman to cut its price target on Microsoft to $32 from $34, but it maintained its equal-weight rating on the Dow component. ""We believe peaking product cycles such as Office 2007 and Windows Vista, an accelerating investment cycle to support the struggling Online Services Business and uncertainties surrounding Yahoo will remain an impediment to material multiple expansion in the near term,"" the firm wrote. Red Flags at GoogleThe red flags raised Thursday by Google included a dramatic slowdown in the company's hiring pace and Chairman Eric Schmidt's description of the economy as ""challenging."" Google's chief economist, Hal Varian, even participated in the company's conference call for the first time to discuss business conditions. ""That was a tip-off,"" said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Derek Brown. ""Economic sluggishness has entered the discussion at Google, more so than we have ever heard."" Google earned $1.25 billion, or $3.92 per share, during the three months ended in June. That represented a 35 percent increase from net income of $925 million, or $2.93 per share, at the same time last year. If not for costs incurred for employee stock compensation, Google said it would have earned $4.63 per share. That figure missed the average earnings estimate of $4.74 per share among analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Google's second-quarter revenue fared slightly better than earnings, rising 39 percent to $5.37 billion from $3.87 billion at the same time last year. More than half the revenue -- $2.8 billion -- came from international markets, helping to offset some of the economic weakness in the United States. After subtracting commissions paid to its ad partners, Google's revenue totaled $3.9 billion -- about $30 million above the average analyst estimate. Stanford Group analyst Clayton Moran interpreted the performance as ""confirmation that there is a slowdown in Internet advertising that's affecting Google."" The trouble may stem more from reluctant consumers than advertisers. The number of paid clicks on the Web sites operated by Google and its partners during the second quarter fell 1 percent from the first quarter, the first sequential downturn that the company has ever reported in the category. The 19 percent year-over-year increase in Google's paid clicks also was the company's lowest ever. ""Consumers are being cautious in their online spending patterns, just as they are in their off-line spending patterns,"" Varian told analysts during Thursday's conference call. Trouble for Yahoo?Google's second-quarter showing could foreshadow more difficulty for rival Yahoo when it releases its results for the same period next Tuesday. After years of earnings disappointments, Yahoo needs to post good numbers and offer an upbeat outlook to reassure its shareholders as it tries to fend off a rebellion led by activist investor Carl Icahn. A rocky quarter would give Icahn more fodder in his effort to oust Yahoo's board at the company's Aug. 1 annual meeting so he can sell all or part of Yahoo to Microsoft Corp. A big part of Google's earnings letdown had nothing to do with online ads. After paying $3.2 billion to buy ad service DoubleClick in March, Google had less cash in the bank and was receiving less income on its remaining money because of lower interest rates.Those factors produced just $58 million in interest and other income in the second quarter, down from $137 million a year ago. ""We continue to believe we are very well positioned,"" Schmidt assured analysts. Varian told analysts the company might even benefit from a ""Wal-Mart effect"" if rising energy and food costs prod budget-conscious consumers to search for deals more frequently online. Long known for its free spending ways, Google appears to be watching its budget more carefully too. The company added just 448 employees during the second quarter -- the fewest hired since the fourth quarter of 2004 when it ushered in 353 new workers. Since 2004 Google has been hiring an average of nearly 1,200 workers per quarter to expand its payroll to 19,604 employees. -AP contributed to this report. "

(See the accompanying video for more on the latest from Microsoft's CEO.)Microsoft bought a 1.6 percent stake in fast-growing Facebook for $240 million in October, beating out Google in the investment. At the time, it reached an exclusive deal to sell ads on Facebook outside of the United States.Facebook Invites Outside Software ProgramsSeparately, Facebook said it's introducing more tools to help the software applications fueling the online hangout's popularity and is promising to intensify its efforts to weed out programs that violate its rules for protecting users' privacy. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's precocious chief executive, outlined the steps in a programmers' conference that underscored the growing influence of the Web site that he started 4 1/2 years ago in his Harvard University dorm room.A crowd of about 1,500 programmers turned out to hear Zuckerberg discuss how he hopes to make it easier for people to share information and entertainment wherever they go on the Web.Zuckerberg, 24, is counting on programmers who aren't employed by Facebook to play a vital role in realizing his vision. More than 30,000 applications have been designed to run on Facebook since the company opened its site to outside developers 14 months ago. The most successful applications have been embraced by millions of Facebook users, helping to turn the startups that developed them into hot commodities. (See the accompanying video for more from Zuckerberg.)Facebook estimates that the makers of its top applications have raised a combined $200 million from venture capitalists. The applications offer a wide variety of features, including sharing photos, recommending music and playing games.""I have to credit Facebook with a large part of our success,"" said Hadi Partovi, president of iLike, which offers a music-recommendation application. Partovi said about half of iLike's 30 million users signed up through Facebook.As the number of outside applications have swelled, Facebook's users have ballooned from 24 million in May 2007 to about 90 million today. The rapid growth has narrowed MySpace.com's lead in the Internet's social networking niche and helped privately held Facebook secure a $240 million investment from Microsoft Corp.Zuckerberg is setting out to broaden the appeal of Facebook's outside applications by giving programmers access to Facebook's tools for translating into 20 different languages.Facebook also is trying make it easier for its users to transplant their personal profiles and favorite applications to other sites.The ""Connect"" initiative, announced in May, moved a step closer to fruition Wednesday with the opening of a ""sandbox"" for programmers to begin making their applications more portable. Two dozen Web sites, including Digg, Citysearch and Movable Type, already have signed up for Connect. Facebook expects the feature to debut in autumn.Having so many outside applications on its site has occasionally caused headaches for Facebook, too. Some applications have included security holes that gave Web surfers unauthorized peeks at the personal profiles of Facebook users while other programs ""tricked people into doing things that they didn't want to do,"" iLike's Partovi said.Facebook has already removed about 1,000 abusive applications since it opened up its Web site to outside programmers and plans to move even more aggressively as it establishes clearer ground rules for operating on its site, said Benjamin Ling, Facebook's director of platform program management.Besides banning abusive programs, Facebook plans to endorse applications it considers to be ""great."" Facebook expects the applications that get its seal of approval to be more appealing to the site's users. ILike and Causes, a program for promoting philanthropy, are the first programs to get Facebook's blessing.Rating the applications ""is a huge shift in philosophy for Facebook,"" said Sean Parker, Causes' chairman and a former Facebook executive who remains close to Zuckerberg. ""Every developer involved with Facebook is going to either walk out of here elated or scared to death."""

Rick Sherlund told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Tuesday the Seattle-based tech giant has lost its momentum from last year. ""They've had a benefit of a great 16-month expansion, and last year you had the migration from the [older] Windows XP, where they ended support, to a newer version of Windows,"" he said. ""You had a tailwind as you're transitioning into the cloud. You had this benefit that's now dissipating, and no one was sure just how much of a benefit that was versus underlying PC demand."" Read MoreWhat Xbox means for Microsoft's revenue   So far in 2015, Microsoft's stock is down 9 percent, after rising 24 percent last year.   Sherlund said that falling sales of Microsoft products also hindered the company in its latest earnings report. ""When you looked under the covers of the December quarter, you realized that while Windows was really down 13 percent, Office was down 13 percent for commercial and 25 [percent] for consumers, it kind of took your breath away,"" he said. ""Then you realize the really tough comparisons are coming up in March and June, so as we say, the honeymoon is over.""   The recent volatility in the foreign exchange markets has also crippled the company's stock, despite having hedged against it. ""Because of the extraordinary move, I guess you just can't hedge for all of that,"" he said.   Nevertheless, another analyst believes the company can rebound.   Brent Thill, managing director at UBS, told CNBC's ""Squawk Alley"" that the tech giant is still outperforming its peers. ""Their commercial business is still growing at a high, single-digit growth rate,"" he said. When you compare to Oracle and other large-cap peers, they're growing at a much bigger pace."" Read MoreMicrosoft regains its edge with hologram headset   Thill added he believes this is just a ""blip"" for the company, as it will complete a $31 billion buy-back and it has ""a lot more recurring revenue given the shift to the cloud."" It will take some time for Microsoft to recover, though. ""Clearly they'll be in the penalty box for a while,"" Thill said.Another positive sign for investors is the cultural change that current CEO Satya Nadella has brought to the company. ""It's cool to work at Microsoft again,"" said Spencer Rascoff, Zillow's CEO on Tuesday. ""Taking the Microsoft Suite of apps and putting it into IOS [is] a small thing, but it sends a huge statement to the technology community that Microsoft is now platform-agnostic and they're embracing mobile."" —CNBC's Thomas DiChristopher contributed to this report.

851,2015-01-26T12:59:17-0500,"  When Microsoft reports earnings after the close Monday, how its Xbox business performs could have an impact on whether the tech titan beats or misses Wall Street's expectations.  Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, is passionate about gaming, calling it ""the single biggest digital life category,"" and he's dedicating a lot of time and money to it.    For example, last September, Microsoft spent $2.5 billion to buy Mojang, maker of the popular game ""Minecraft.""    Today, investors are awaiting more clarity about Xbox's success in winning over gamers, which Microsoft bulls bet could help the software giant best analyst forecasts.    ""This could be a real source of the upside,"" says Daniel Ives of FBR Capital Markets.   The company is aiming make its Xbox One console more attractive to consumers by slashing the price. It initially sold the Xbox One for $499, but then cut the price by $100 for an Xbox sold without the Kinect motion sensing device. Microsoft then cut another $50 off last fall for the holidays.     Read MoreWill hologram headset give Microsoft back its edge?   The price cuts appear to have had a big impact. Microsoft said that, for both November and December, the Xbox One was the best-selling console in the U.S., though it declined to give exact numbers.   Looking ahead, one critical question for investors is how exactly Xbox fits into Microsoft's broader business strategy.   At first, Microsoft thought of the Xbox console as a potential way to control the living room. The device, so it was believed, could be the central hub that consumers looked to for all their entertainment, whether that was gaming, movies or music. But Microsoft now appears to be setting more humble goals for the product. For instance, last October, Nadella officially shut down Xbox Entertainment Studios, ending the company's move into original video programming.  Technology analysts say that Xbox's role appears under review.   ""Xbox doesn't necessarily fit into Nadella's cloud and mobility strategy,"" says Patrick Moorhead, president of Moor Insights &amp; Strategy. ""Right now, I think there is a reassessment going on about where Xbox strategically fits.""    Moorhead adds, ""They can't just pull the plug on it tomorrow. They have a huge installed base of people, and most Xbox users have Windows PCs, as well.""   However, while it's under review, Xbox still offers Microsoft a lot of potential benefits.    For one, it's a product that attracts many young fans. Lewis Ward, IDC's Research Director of Gaming, told CNBC that he estimates Microsoft sold 12.5 million of its Xbox One consoles through the end of 2014.   Also, thanks to Xbox Live, Microsoft retains useful data about its users, which it could use to cross-sell other services and products, such as Skype or Office 365.

Analysts at Nomura estimate that, after accounting for sales, marketing, and research and development, Microsoft loses money on its Xbox division.    So this afternoon, it's up to Nadella to prove to his investors that gaming isn't just an important source of entertainment, but a business that makes both strategic and financial sense for Microsoft's future.

852,2015-01-26T10:14:04-0500,"  As Microsoft executives were busy wowing the tech world with holographic goggles that blend the virtual and physical worlds through a futuristic computing platform, investors were busy selling the stock.   The reaction makes sense. At its presentation Wednesday, Microsoft didn't say exactly when the new HoloLens technology will go on sale, and it's way too early to gauge consumer demand. But more important was another announcement from Microsoft on the same day that, at least in the short term, could damage its financials.    Long surviving off lucrative software licenses, Microsoft said that it's giving away free upgrades of its fresh Windows 10 operating system to users of the older stuff. Clearly, Microsoft recognizes that in the new world of software subscriptions and frequent updates, the practice of constantly charging customers no longer works.  Read MoreBetting on Box? Watch out for Microsoft  ""This is important to rotate customers onto the latest operating system, and serves as a lever to entice developers to build applications for the platform,"" wrote Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners, who has a hold rating on the stock and a $49 price target. ""That said, a company whose primary business is selling software may have a near term negative impact by providing the product for free.""   Of course, Microsoft will still make money from people buying new computers with Windows 10 software, but the PC market isn't growing. In mobile, where Apple and Google dominate, Microsoft's new office programs will be free.    Microsoft reports fiscal second-quarter financials Monday afternoon, and despite the stock's 1 percent sell-off on the day of the big media event, investors are generally bullish. The shares have jumped 31 percent in the past year to $47.18 at Friday's close.  Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, almost a year into his tenure, has boosted the cloud business and partnered with companies big and small to expand its offerings. Analysts expect revenue growth of 7.4 percent in the quarter to $26.3 billion, with a drop in earnings per share to 71 cents from 78 cents, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.    Microsoft said last week that Windows 10 will be offered as a service but didn't provide specifics around potential subscription pricing. Software as a service, or SaaS, is the new model for delivery and one that Microsoft is being forced to adopt.   ""They can't fight the trend,"" said Sameer Dholakia, CEO of SendGrid, a start-up that sells e-mail infrastructure as a service. ""With Satya leading the charge, they're making some bold and sweeping changes required to compete in a mobile and cloud era.""

Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Securities, wrote in a report that he expects to hear more about the move to subscriptions on the earnings call.   Sherlund, who has a buy recommendation on the stock and a $56 price target, also called the HoloLens announcement ""one of the most fascinating"" parts of the briefing.   Read MorePro: Buy Amazon now  Keeping consumers and developers enthused about Microsoft's future is critical in a world where Facebook and Google are investing in virtual reality, Apple is pushing further into wearable computing and Amazon.com dominates cloud infrastructure.

""The augmented reality computing platform demo was intriguing, but clearly in the early stages,"" Sherlund wrote. "
853,2015-01-27T11:03:40-0500," Microsoft on Monday reported a fall in its quarterly profit that was in line with Wall Street forecasts, as sluggish personal computer sales dampened demand for Windows software and the company struggled with the impact of the strong U.S. dollar.   Shares tumbled some 10 percent in early trading on Tuesday, putting the stock on pace for its worst day since July 2013.

Revenue increased to $26.47 billion from $24.52 billion a year ago, helped by its recent acquisition of Nokia's mobile business.   Computing and gaming hardware revenue decreased 11 percent to $4 billion, dragged by lower Xbox platform sales, Microsoft said.    Commercial revenue sales totaled $13.3 billion during the quarter, while devices and consumer revenue came in at $12.9 billion. Commercial licensing revenue, a gauge of its flagship Windows business, fell 2 percent, year-over-year, primarily due falling revenue from from Office commercial.   Read MoreFor Microsoft, it's virtual reality vs real money  The company said commercial cloud sales reached an annualized revenue run rate of $5.5 billion, driven by its Office 365, Azure and Dynamic CRM Online offerings.    ""It looks like they had good growth in terms of their cloud business. I think the area we're really focusing on is that space, in terms of its growth and how much they cannibalize their core windows enterprise server business,"" said Dan Morgan of Synovus Trust, which owns shares in Microsoft.    Microsoft said its cloud business has seen triple-digit growth for the past six straight quarters.     ""Microsoft is continuing to transform, executing against our strategic priorities and extending our cloud leadership,"" said Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO.     Wall Street expected Microsoft to post earnings of 71 cents per share on $26.3 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates.  Microsoft last week rolled out two new products: Windows 10 and HoloLens, a pair of virtual reality goggles that incorporate computer screen images into the real world. Microsoft did not, however, state when the product would hit the shelves. Windows 10 will be the company's latest operating system and users will receive it for free.   The company is also aiming make its Xbox One console more attractive to consumers by slashing the price. It initially sold the Xbox One for $499, but then cut the price by $100 for an Xbox sold without the Kinect motion sensing device. Microsoft then shaved off another $50 for the holidays.

854,2015-01-22T07:26:14-0500,"  The future depicted in Hollywood movies may have finally arrived.     Microsoft unveiled an augmented reality headset at an event at its Redmond, WA headquarters on Wednesday that projects holograms onto the real world, in a move that analysts said has given the U.S. technology giant its competitive edge.   A video demonstration of the HoloLens shows people playing Minecraft in their living room or talking to a friend through Skype with the holographic image appearing in front of them.   HoloLens and Microsoft Holographic – the computer system that the headset runs on – was unveiled as part of the launch of Windows 10 on Wednesday, the Redmond, WA-based company's latest operating system.   ""Our industry's progress is punctuated by moments of category creation. Windows 10 and holographic computing is one such moment,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, said at the launch.    HoloLens does not require a connection to a PC and is wireless. Users can see through the dark lenses and use their hands to interact with the projected hologram. Microsoft billed the device as both a consumer and business product, showing how it could be used by games as well as designers to create three dimensional renders of a potential product.  Analysts marked the release of the HoloLens as the moment Windows returned to being at the forefront of technology.    ""Microsoft was clearly repositioning itself as a company that wanted to be known for innovation,"" Ian Fogg, head of mobile at IHS, told CNBC by phone.   The virtual reality and augmented reality market is still in its early stages, but, with the new product, Microsoft is hoping to gain a strong foothold in the market. Its direct competitor is the Oculus VR – the company behind the Oculus Rift headset – which Facebook bought for $2 billion last year.    ""Unlike other augmented reality experiences like Oculus which is focused primarily on gaming, Microsoft is positioning HoloLens as a multipurpose computer,"" Fogg added.Read MoreWhat's next for virtual reality? Think social  Microsoft said it had worked with NASA to create a hologram image of Mars using the pictures from the Mars Rover, allowing them to explore the surface in close detail.   Last week, Google axed its current version of Glass and said it would reorganize the business behind it, casting doubt of the future of smart eyewear. But Microsoft has shown its faith in the device category.    Analysts said that getting developers on board the platform will be key for the success of HoloLens.   ""The true innovation it delivers will be determined by developer commitment in the months and years to come,"" Geoff Blaber vice president for Americas research at CCS Insight, said in a note.  Nadella took over the reins at Microsoft nearly a year ago and has since helped keep the technology giant relevant through its focus on cloud computing. Windows 10 continues Nadella's vision as it looks to shake off the negativity that surrounded its predecessor, Windows 8.   A new browser as well as Microsoft's answer to Apple's Siri known as Cortana has been introduced on the operating system which will be used across mobiles, tablets, PCs and the Xbox One games console.   Microsoft's share price is up 26 percent over the year and analysts are positive about the company's future.   ""Microsoft remains well-positioned and laser-focused in strong secular growth areas (e.g., cloud) while recent restructuring efforts should make it a 'leaner and meaner' technology giant over the coming years,"" Daniel Ives, managing director of technology research at FBR Capital Markets, said in a note. "
855,2015-01-21T16:34:28-0500," Microsoft's newest operating system, Windows 10, will replace its highly unpopular Windows 8, and Microsoft needs to get it right.   ""Microsoft lost a quite a bit of credibility in the consumer market just by the way [Windows 8] was launched, even though the operating system was quite good,"" said Rahul Sood, former general manager of Microsoft ventures and CEO of Unikrn. ""It was a jarring experience going from the modern Start menu to the old way of navigating Windows. They've got some work to do to catch up."" Read MoreMicrosoft Outlook 'hacked' by Chinese authorities   The new operating system must be able to reinvigorate the desktop experience but remain familiar, simple and easy to use, he said. Microsoft aims to woo Windows users who opted to skip the Windows 8 upgrade and are waiting to see if the overhaul will get it right this time.    ""I think Microsoft has gone back to the drawing board and rethought navigation all together,"" Sood said. ""They're hoping to see many of the people that have Windows 7 and previous versions of Windows upgrading to Windows 10.""   Even as Microsoft says it is listening to consumers and promises an operating system capable of bringing Microsoft customers back into the fold, the mobile market remains a potential pitfall for the tech giant. ""As far as mobile goes, that's a tough one. It's really hard when the app ecosystem isn't quite up to snuff compared to their peers,"" Sood said. ""Mobile is a massive challenge for them."""
856,2015-01-21T09:06:51-0500,"Making 6 percent worth of yield just by holding Microsoft might sound too good to be true, but that's just what one big trader is attempting to accomplish with the help of options.  In one of Tuesday's biggest single-stock options trades, a trader sold 15,000 January 2016 52.50-strike calls on Microsoft for $1.50 per share, while simultaneously purchasing 420,000 shares of the stock.  This strategy is known as a ""covered call"" or ""buy-write,"" and the goal is to squeeze as much yield out of a stock as possible.  How does it work?   For starters, since a call represents the right to buy a stock for a given price within a given period of time, selling a call is a strategy that profits if the stock stays below that price within that time period. However, selling a call by itself is extremely risky, since as the stock rises, so do the losses of the trader who is short the call, with no knowable limit.    On the other hand, if the trader is also long the stock, then the worst thing that happens is that the trader's shares of the stock are ""called away."" That means that in exchange for the money collected for selling the call, the traders' only risk is they will be forced to hand over the shares, thus giving up on the upside above a certain level. (However, note that the level above which a stock has to rise in order for the trader to regret selling the call is the strike price plus the option premium, as the trader realized an immediate gain on the sale.) Read More  Microsoft to show off more Windows 10 features   When it comes to this trade, Dan Nathan of RiskReversal.com makes the assumption that the trader is already long 1.1 million or so Microsoft shares, so that the options sale ""overwrites"" a position of 1.5 million shares.   In that case, the investors long the stock and short the options would add the $2.25 million made by selling the options (that's $1.50 times 15,000 times the 100 shares each options contract controls) to the 2.7 percent dividend yield that the stock already throws off—for a total yearly ""super-yield"" of nearly 6 percent, or more than $4 million.

857,2015-01-20T08:59:39-0500,"  Microsoft's Outlook email service in China was hacked by the country's censorship authority, an internet watchdog has claimed, as the government continues its crackdown on U.S. technology giants.   Greatfire.org, which monitors censorship in China, said that Microsoft's servers were subject to a so-called man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, enabling hackers to intercept private emails between users.    A Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC they were aware of ""a small number of customers impacted by malicious routing to a server impersonating Outlook.com.""  It is hard for a victim to detect this type of attack because the man-in-the-middle is often just eavesdropping and mining the data being sent. In this instance, hackers targeted the technology which communicates with Microsoft's servers and enables users to access emails on their smartphones.   ""We suspect that the Cyberspace Administration of China, which is directly in charge of censorship… is directly responsible for the MITM attack against Outlook, and the recent related MITM attacks in China,"" Greatfire's report said.   The attack follows a complete block of Google's Gmail in China  and highlights the way in which Chinese authorities are allegedly tightly controlling communication in the world's second-largest economy.   Similar MITM attacks were carried out on Google, Yahoo and Apple  last year. The MITM attack on Apple coincided with the high-profile release of its iPhone in China in October.   ""This new attack signals that the Chinese authorities are intent on further cracking down on communication methods that they cannot readily monitor,"" Greatfire's report added.  The watchdog called this form of attack – which affects mobile devices when emails are being downloaded automatically in the background – as ""especially devious.""   ""The warning messages users receive from their email clients are much less noticeable than the warning messages delivered to modern browsers,"" Greatfire's report said.   Read MoreUS charges China with cyber-spying on American firms   The Microsoft spokesperson added: ""If a customer sees a certificate warning, they should contact their service provider for assistance.""   When a user opened their inbox on their phone, a message popped up which said the identity of the email server could not be verified. But the Greatfire report said consumers will ""not think twice"" before clicking the ""continue"" option on the error message as they would likely attribute it to a network problem.   If a user hit continue, their emails and login credentials would be in the hands of the hackers.   ""We strongly recommend that users never bypass certificate error messages by clicking 'continue',"" the report warned. "

Google missed earnings and revenue estimates as aggregate cost-per-clicks fell 7 percent, year-over-year. However, shares rose 3 percent in after-hours trading.   Microsoft topped Wall Street's forecasts on the top and bottom lines, boosted by strong growth in its hardware and cloud sectors. The stock rose more than 3 percent after the announcement.   Starbucks shares rose after it reported profit that was in line with projections, while revenue came in better-than-expected. Global comparable-store sales also topped projections.  Altera missed expectations on the top and bottom lines, sending shares tumbling about 5 percent.  The chip maker reported first-quarter earnings of 31 cents a share, missing estimates by a penny.  Meanwhile, revenue came in at $435 million, compared to forecasts for $471 million.    Music streaming provider Pandora reported a narrower-than-expected first-quarter loss of 12 cents a share on $231 million, which also beat estimates. However, shares fell as key user metrics missed projections.     "
859,2008-05-16T11:34:16-0400,"Two weeks after Microsoft abandoned its pursuit of Yahoo, a proxy fight launched by activist investor Carl Icahn has put Microsoft in the driver's seat.Icahn wants Yahoo to reopen talks with Microsoft , saying the company's board had acted ""irrationally"" when it rejected Microsoft's $47.5 billion buyout offer.Microsoft walked away from the deal earlier this month when Yahoo rejected its final offer of $33 a share, holding out for at least $37 a share.""With Yahoo being pushed by shareholders to get back to the table, you would think it's just what Microsoft wanted,"" said Marc Weingarten, an attorney with Schulte Roth &amp; Zabel.For its part, Microsoft has declined to comment on Icahn's actions.A company spokesman repeated the same message that its executives have said over the last two weeks: it had moved on.Still, Icahn has opened the door for Microsoft to swoop in as white knight and buy Yahoo in a friendly deal without instigating the proxy battle it had threatened.""Microsoft can come directly back to the Yahoo board and save them from the proxy contest, save them from all the criticism that they are getting,"" said Weingarten.Microsoft's motivation for buying Yahoo -- to create an online advertising powerhouse to rival Google -- remains intact.The alternatives of a build-from-within strategy and a piece-by-piece acquisition strategy could bring significant risk.Mergers and acquisitions experts said it would be wise for Microsoft to lie low and see if pressure from Icahn and other activist investors will prompt Yahoo's board to turn to Microsoft with hat in hand.""The whole strategy for Microsoft, in an M&amp;A sense, was to say 'fine, we take our bat and ball and go home.' You don't want to say that and then be seen popping out of the house and looking down the block for your former playmates,"" said Marshall Sonenshine, Chairman of New York-based investment bank Sonenshine Partners.""If they have any intention of coming back, they shouldn't say anything.If they don't have any intention, then they have nothing to say,"" said Sonenshine, who sees the deal getting done at a price slightly above $33 a share.Sonenshine said an eventual Microsoft-Yahoo deal may play out like News Corp's acquisition of Dow Jones.The Bancroft family, which controlled Dow Jones, balked at News Corp's $5.6 billion bid, but the 65 percent premium proved too attractive for many family members to resist, especially after it eliminated the possibility of competing bids.Similarly, shareholders may push Yahoo to accept Microsoft's $33-a-share bid, a 72 percent premium on Yahoo's share price before Microsoft went public with its hostile bid on Feb. 1, especially if no other viable offers emerge.Shares of Yahoo fell below $23 after Microsoft pulled its offer.Yahoo's two largest shareholders, Capital Research Management and Legg Mason, have signaled displeasure with how the company handled negotiations with Microsoft.In a response to Icahn, Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock defended the board's actions and said it continues to ""actively and expeditiously explore strategic alternatives.""""What's unusual about this is that the Yahoo board said, 'no, this is not good enough, and we're just going to go back to being a company.' The stock collapsed and that honked off a lot of shareholders,"" said Bob Profusek, head of the mergers and acquisitions practice at law firm Jones Day.""Everybody is fixated on the Microsoft bid, but causing something else to happen that would create short-term shareholder value could also be a pay day for (Icahn)."" Historically, companies targeted in a hostile takeover bid would issue a special dividend, a major share buyback or another measure to ease the blow from a fall in the share price if a deal collapsed, according to Profusek."
860,2008-05-05T08:48:54-0400,"Shares of Yahoo fell 22 percent in premarket trading as hopes for the once dominant search engine dimmed on the withdrawal of a $43.7 billion bid from Microsoft over the weekend. Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang is convinced that the company he started in a Silicon Valley trailer 14 years ago was worth more than the money Microsoft had offered for the Internet pioneer.Now he may only have a few months to convince Wall Street that his rebuff of Microsoft's takeover bid was a smart move -- and if he can't, analysts won't be surprised if Yang is either replaced as CEO or forced to consider accepting a lower offer if Microsoft comes knocking at his door again. ""This squarely puts the pressure on Jerry Yang to deliver results and shareholder value,"" Standard &amp; Poor's equity analyst Scott Kessler said. ""You are going to see a lot of shareholders just throwing in the towel because they are going to realize it's going to take awhile for the stock to get back to where it was Friday."" The backlash is expected to begin Monday when Kessler and other analysts believe Yahoo's stock price will surrender most, if not all, of its 50 percent gain since Microsoft made its initial offer Jan. 31. The anticipated sell-off would leave Yahoo's market value hovering around $30 billion. Yahoo shares tumbled 22 percent, or $6.34, to $22.33 in premarket trading. In Frankfurt, Germany, two hours before trading opened in New York, Yahoo shares fell 18.6 percent to 14.74 euros ($22.79). Microsoft's shares rose 4.3 percent, or $1.26, to $30.50 in premarket trading Monday. The shares had declined 10 percent to $29.24 since the bid, reflecting concerns that the proposed marriage would turn into a complicated mess that would enable Google Inc. to grow even stronger. Yahoo shares finished last week at $28.67, slightly less than the $29.40 per share that Microsoft was offering before Chief Executive Steve Ballmer agreed to raise the offer to $33 per share in a last-ditch effort to get a deal done. Disillusioned shareholders are bound to question whether the rejection of Microsoft's sweetened offer was driven more by emotion and ego than sound business sense. ""Clearly there's frustration,"" said Darren Chervitz, co-manager of the Jacob Internet Fund, which owns Yahoo stock. ""I am not even sure if Yahoo cares about its shareholders because they didn't show much regard for shareholders' best interests in this process."" Despite such negative sentiment, Yahoo shares are unlikely to immediately fall back to their $19.18 pre-bid price, partly because some investors may still be holding out hope that the software maker will renew its takeover attempt if Yahoo continues to struggle. Accompanied by fellow Yahoo co-founder David Filo, Yang flew to Seattle on Saturday to inform Ballmer that the company wouldn't sell for less than $37 per share -- a price that Yahoo's stock hasn't reached since January 2006. Analysts and investors were left to wonder why the two sides couldn't compromise at $35 per share. ""They really didn't seem that far apart,"" Chervitz said. ""There is probably blame to go around on both sides, but I think most of it is in Yang's hands."" To win the faith of shareholders, Yang will have to execute a turnaround plan that he began drawing up nearly a year ago after he replaced Terry Semel as CEO amid shareholder angst about the company's financial malaise. Ballmer also will be under the gun to prove he can come up with another way to challenge Google's dominance of the Internet's lucrative search and advertising markets. The unsolicited bid was widely seen as Ballmer's admission that Microsoft needed Yahoo's help to upgrade its unprofitable Internet division. Analysts now expect Ballmer to use the money he had earmarked for the Yahoo acquisition to explore other possible deals with large Internet companies like Time Warner Inc.'s AOL and News Corp.'s MySpace and promising startups like Facebook Inc. and LinkedIn Corp. Microsoft already owns a 1.6 percent in Facebook, the second-largest social network behind MySpace. But Ballmer is unlikely to be under as much duress as Yang, 39, who has promised that Yahoo's development of a more sophisticated and far-flung Internet advertising platform will produce net revenue growth of at least 25 percent in 2009 and 2010. That would be a dramatic improvement, considering that Yahoo's revenue rose by 12 percent last year and is expected to grow at about the same pace this year. Analysts, though, are skeptical about whether Yahoo will be able to hit those targets, raising the chances for a shareholder rebellion if the company stumbles in the next two quarters -- a distinct possibility if advertisers curtail spending in a shaky U.S. economy, as many analysts fear. As it is, Yang and the rest of Yahoo's board almost certainly will face more lawsuits from incensed shareholders. Even some of Yahoo's own employees may be irritated because virtually all of them own stock options. What's more, Microsoft had planned to offer $1.5 billion in retention packages to the thousands of Yahoo employees it wanted to stay on after a takeover. To help boost its short-term profits and its stock price, Yahoo is widely expected to form a long-term advertising partnership with Google. Although the final details are still being ironed out, Yahoo wants to hire Google to place some of the text-based ads that appear alongside the search results on its Web site. It's a task that Google already handles for scores of Web sites, including AOL and Ask.com. Both Yahoo and Google have said they were encouraged with the results of a two-week trial run completed last month. But turning to Google for help would be a humbling step for Yahoo after spending more than $2 billion to acquire and build its own technology. An alliance between Google and Yahoo also would face antitrust hurdles because the two companies combined control more than 80 percent of the U.S. search advertising market. Although Google's superior technology would help boost Yahoo's profits in the short term, some analysts worry it could be a mistake for Yahoo to surrender any control over such a lucrative piece of the online ad market. Yahoo also has been exploring a possible merger with AOL's Internet operations but may now have to contend with a competing offer from Microsoft. Yahoo also might attempt to placate shareholders by buying back stock. Kessler believes Yang should use some of his estimated $1.9 billion fortune to personally buy more Yahoo stock even though he already owns 54.1 million shares, or 3.9 percent of the company. ""Jerry Yang really needs to put his money where his mouth is,"" Kessler said. ""If he really thinks Yahoo is worth $37 (per share), then he needs to step up and buy some shares when they are in the low $20."" "
861,2008-05-02T18:30:34-0400,"Microsoft and Yahoo, which were on the brink of a hostile takeover battle earlier this week, are now discussing a friendly merger that would involve more money for Yahoo shareholders.The two could reach a takeover deal as soon as this weekend, a person familiar with Microsoft's thinking told Reuters on Friday.But talks are at a sensitive stage and a deal is not certain, added the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the talks.Microsoft has reluctantly agreed to raise its stock and cash offer of $31 a share for Yahoo to about $33, though Yahoo is holding out for $37, sources have told CNBC.  The current bid is worth about $42.4 billion.The dicussions have heated up despite Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer's comment on Thursday that walking away from a deal with Yahoo was one of three options the company is weighing. The Wall Street Journal also has reported that Microsoft appeared to be leaning toward initiating a hostile takeover of Yahoo.Microsoft has promised this would be the week that it spells out its next moves if Yahoo allowed a deadline set for last Saturday to expire on its three-month-old offer to buy Yahoo.  But in a sign that Yahoo continues to resist Microsoft's  embrace, a source familiar with discussions between Yahoo and Google said a partnership could come as early as next week. The non-exclusive partnership would involve Yahoo carrying Google advertising alongside Yahoo's Web search results. Despite Friday's developments, Yahoo is still holding talks with other potential partners about an alternative to Microsoft's bid for the company, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.Yahoo has held discussions with Time Warner's AOL Internet division and News Corp.over a potential deal. Ballmer: Yahoo 'Part' of a StrategyBallmer told employees during a regularly scheduled company Town Hall meeting that Yahoo is valuable as part of a strategy to beat Microsoft arch-rival Google, but there are limits on the price Microsoft is ready to pay. ""Yahoo's not a strategy, it's a part of a strategy,"" Ballmer declared. His remarks were first reported by Silicon Alley Insider, whose reporter said he monitored the internal conference call. A company spokesman confirmed the comments. ""We're interested to pay for it at some level and beyond that level we're not willing to pay for it. I know exactly what Yahoo is worth to me ... I won't go a dime above and I will go to what I think it's worth if that gets the deal done,"" he said. (See CNBC's report on the latest Microsoft-Yahoo developments at left.)Seeking to force Yahoo to the negotiating table in early April, Ballmer wrote a letter to Yahoo's board of directors threatening to cut the bid and mount a proxy fight to remove the board if Yahoo did not reach a deal by April 26. Ballmer went further last week by saying Microsoft was considering walking away from the deal. But most Wall Street analysts dismiss this as a hardball negotiating tactic rather than a real threat to end its two-year-long pursuit of a deal. On Thursday, five days after Microsoft's deadline for reaching a negotiated deal expired, Ballmer told employees ""we ought to announce something in very short order.""""We've got basically the three big options in front of us,"" Ballmer summarized. ""There's the friendly deal, there's an unfriendly deal, (and the) third path is simply to walk away."" The two companies are in a standoff over price. Yahoo responded within weeks of receiving the unsolicited takeover bid by saying the offer ""substantially undervalues"" it. It has sought other partners, while not ruling out a Microsoft deal. The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that Microsoft had told Yahoo it was willing to raise its bid to as much as $33 a share, but was unwilling to go as high as the $35 to $37 a share for which Yahoo's major investors have lobbied. Ballmer repeated the key reasons for buying Yahoo were that it would allow Microsoft to move faster in creating a credible No. 2 to Google, which dominates key segments of the Internet market and is expanding rapidly in new directions. Yahoo would provide Microsoft scale, a bigger audience for Web search — a key starting point for many Internet users — and a stronger presence in online advertising, he said. ""The world is rooting for us,"" Ballmer said. ""The world hopes that there's ... a very strong company that's not the number one guy,"" he said, referring to Google. Most Wall Street analysts believe Microsoft's most likely next move is to begin a months-long proxy campaign, according to a Reuters poll conducted late last week. Analysts believe Microsoft will win but at great cost to Yahoo employee morale. - Reuters contributed to this report."
862,2008-04-25T14:10:23-0400,"Hours away now from the Microsoft imposed deadline for Yahoo to negotiate or die. Too dramatic? Not really when you're talking about $40 billion hanging in the balance as well as the future dominance of all things digital.Too dramatic still? Not so, when you think about Steve Ballmer's decade-long, iron-fisted rule of the world's largest software maker whose entire legacy may hinge on whether this deal goes through; or whether Microsoft will be rebuffed by a cadre of upstarts at a company with a silly name. I know, I know, not so silly when you consider the wealth and influence Yahoo has created since it was founded in a Stanford dorm room lo those many years ago. But it's Yahoo's legacy too that's at risk if the company shuns this deal and decides to spend immeasurable resources and energy -- in what most believe will be a defense in vain -- trying to fend off the bad boys from Redmond. Legacy aside, if Microsoft goes nuclear, and walks from the deal all together, Yahoo's team runs the risk of a tsunami of fiduciary responsibility lawsuits. Yahoo's got some problems. Some say the company's status as ""victim"" was solidified when Microsoft slapped that three-week deadline on Yahoo, well, three weeks ago tomorrow. An arbitrary deadline that injected a healthy dose of drama where it wasn't necessarily needed. But it wasn't arbitrary. Yahoo isn't negotiating. And Microsoft needed to do something to get Yahoo's attention. Chris Liddell, Microsoft's CFO, says the company has ""unrealistic expectations"" of its own value, leading analysts to believe Yahoo is pushing for $40 a share or higher, when Microsoft, already offering a 62 percent premium, is standing pat at $31. Yahoo could certainly make a case for a higher value if it came up with better earnings, and far better guidance. But it didn't. Yahoo could make the case for a sweeter deal if there were other suitors lined up with counters. But News Corp. is in Microsoft's c the AOL/Time-Warner alternative -- if there really is one -- is bordering on financial laughability when compared to the Microsoft deal already on the table; and Yahoo's bold attempt at a new ad-sharing relationship with Google -- brief that it was -- was enough to raise the ire of US Justice Department antitrust investigators, if you believe Reuters.Microsoft isn't in a much better position: the company's online unit enjoyed 40 percent year over year growth to well over $800 million, but still managed to post more than $220 million in losses. It's not as if Microsoft is just now trying to stake a claim online; it's been trying for 10 years and that kind of financial performance speaks volumes about the company's inability to come up with a winning formula. I'm not sure Yahoo is the magic bullet Microsoft needs, but Microsoft -- like Yahoo -- is running out of options. For Yahoo, the clock is ticking. Time's up. Checkmate. Call it what you will, but the facts are these: Yahoo can delay, delay, delay and waste a lot of time and money on a protracted proxy war, and while Microsoft will come out on top, the collateral damage to brand and finances and public relations may not be worth it. Not to mention that as much as they'd want to think Google is standing by on the sidelines, paralyzed by all the drama and simply waiting to see what happens next, that company is continuing to innovate, and continuing to weave itself more intricately into our everyday lives. The more Microsoft and Yahoo distract each other with a proxy battle, the more market share Google stands to gain. Microsoft does have a couple of last ditch options: Increase the offer (unlikely); walk from the deal; snap up shares of Yahoo on the open market; or maybe a combination of both. Here's a thought: announce you're walking from the deal, watch Yahoo's shares plunge into the low teens, and THEN, snap up shares on the open market and buy the company at half the price you're offering today. Long shot? Maybe. But a possibility nonetheless. Questions?  Comments?  TechCheck@cnbc.com"
863,2008-04-22T17:34:01-0400,"Yahoo posted quarterly profit at the top end of Wall Street's lowered forecasts, but analysts questioned whether the results would force Microsoft to increase its takeover bid for the company.The online search and advertising firm said it earned 11 cents a share on a topline of $1.35 billion in the first quarter, excluding one-time items, compared with a profit of 10 cents a share on sales of $1.324 billion last year.A consensus forecast of analysts who follow Yahoo called for earnings of 9 cents a share on revenue of $1.183 billion in the most recent quarter.For the current quarter, Yahoo now sees revenue reaching a range of $1.73 billion to $1.93 billion. Current estimates for the quarter stand at $1.37 billion.The company's stock was slightly lower in extended trading Tuesday after finishing regular market hours near flat at $28.54.In the quarter that ended March 31, the struggling Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Internet company began a fight to avoid an unsolicited takeover by Microsoftand started the process of cutting up to 7 percent of its workforce. In February, Microsoft offered $31 per share for Yahoo in an unsolicited bid originally valued at $44.6 billion. Analysts told Reuters that the results were unlikely to sway Microsoft to boost its bid.""It doesn't seem to change in any way the current acquisition landscape,"" said Derek Brown, an analyst with Cantor Fitzgerald. ""It's hard to see an indication that the trajectory of Yahoo's business has altered noticeably, and in that light there doesn't seem to be a compelling reason for Microsoft to alter their bid."" ""First-quarter earnings look good, kind of in-line, maybe a little better on margins,"" said Mike Binger, a fund manager at Thrivent Financial who owns both Microsoft and Yahoo shares. ""But there is some guidance out there that I don't have any explanation for, way ahead of estimates."" ""The only thing they've said is long-term investments are beginning to pay off. It's surprising that they can raise their next-quarter guidance so much. I would say at this point Microsoft would stay their bid,"" Binger told Reuters.CEO Yang: Open to 'Any and All Alternatives'Yahoo remains open to doing a deal with Microsoft but also continues to explore alternative deals, its chief executive and co-founder, Jerry Yang, said on Tuesday.""Our board and management team continue to be open to any and all alternatives, including a Microsoft deal,"" Yang told investors on a conference call to discuss the company's first-quarter results, released earlier in the day.Yang said the company's recent efforts to remake its business strategy related to technology, audiences and advertising customers were ""starting to pay off.""Yahoo's top executive said that while the company remains active in the Web search advertising market, its emphasis is on display advertising, which corporate marketers rely on for online brand ads. ""While we see opportunities in Web search, our largest opportunity is in display advertising,"" he said.CFO: No Problem with Microsoft, Just Its BidYahoo Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen said Tuesday the company was not opposed to selling to Microsoft Corp, but is against a deal that undervalues the company.In an interview with Reuters, Jorgensen said its first-quarter results were ""right on track'' despite having to deal with the distraction of Microsoft's offer.""We are not opposed to a deal with Microsoft. What we are opposed to is seeing it at a value that discounts the underlying value of the company,'' Jorgensen said moments after the company announced its first-quarter results.Yahoo and Microsoft are in a stand-off over Microsoft's $43 billion bid to acquire the company. Yahoo has said Microsoft's unsolicited offer undervalues the company, while Microsoft has said its offer is full and fair."
864,2008-04-27T20:53:27-0400,"A Microsoft deadline for Internet service company Yahoo to accept its $44.6 billion acquisition offer expired at midnight Saturday, setting the stage for a hostile takeover bid by the software giant.The expiration of the Sunday 0700 GMT deadline — without comment from either side — was likely to pave the way for an ugly proxy battle — a fight by Microsoft for a vote by Yahoo shareholders to place pro-Microsoft officials on its board of directors.In an open letter to the Yahoo board of directors on April 5, Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer gave the Internet pioneer three weeks to accept the $31 a share takeover offer or face a proxy fight.Ballmer also warned that any further delays could result in a less attractive offer for Yahoo.However Yahoo's board of directors has said the offer ""substantially undervalues"" the California firm, insisting the company is worth at least $40 a share.Microsoft is eager to merge the two companies' resources to take on Google , which dominates the lucrative Internet search advertising market which is expected to grow to $80 bln annually worldwide in the next two years.Microsoft chief financial officer Chris Liddell said Thursday that the US software giant is standing by the April 26 deadline.Microsoft's options now include withdrawing its offer, a move that could outrage Yahoo shareholders who have seen Microsoft's offer sharply push up Yahoo's share price.Some have threatened to sue Yahoo's board for failing in its duty to maximize the value of their investment.To avoid Microsoft's clutches, Yahoo has sought a strategic tie-up with a ""white knight,"" reportedly examining possible alliances with social networking website MySpace, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., and with Time Warner's faded Internet star America Online.Yahoo even tested letting Google handle placing online advertising on Yahoo's own search pages to determine whether it generates more money than Yahoo's new Panama online ad platform.Analysts believe that Google only benefits while Yahoo and Microsoft are distracted by the takeover quest. (Who can say ""no"" Longer? See video).On Thursday, Microsoft reported that its profits slipped to $4.38 billion in the first three months of the year despite revenues rising slightly to $14.45 billion.The world's biggest software company reported earnings of 47 cents per share — topping financial analysts' predictions by two cents but lower than the 50 cents per share, or $4.93 billion, posted in the same quarter a year earlier."

""Currently, it's in their hands to decide the outcome of that offer,"" he said. Microsoft had threatened on Saturday to launch a hostile bid for Yahoo and could lower its offer of $42.4 billion in about three weeks if it does not get a deal, which Yahoo argues is worth more than Microsoft's bid. The New York Times reported this week News Corpwas in talks to join Microsoft's bid for the Web pioneer. The offer for Yahoo was in line with Microsoft's aim to enhance its digital advertising capabilities, Turner said. ""We will continue to drive marketshare from a search standpoint within the consumer space, and that's a strategy we're committed to in the long term,"" he said. The offer for Yahoo was ""a tactic and a strategy"" toward that goal, Turner said. ""The rest is now up to their board ... With or without the acquisition we are committed to becoming a world class digital advertising company."" Yahoo announced on Wednesday a test to outsource Web search advertising to Google, which sources say is part of a three-way alliance that would combine Yahoo with Time Warner'sAOL instead of Microsoft. But a joint Microsoft-News Corp bid would create a more formidable competitor to Google by bringing together three of the biggest Web site publishers: Yahoo, Microsoft's MSN and News Corp's MySpace social network. Any of the potential mergers would fundamentally change business on the Web as growth slows dramatically after a decade of explosive growth. "

870,2014-12-23T11:32:53-0500," Microsoft established dominance in the software market by selling its Windows suite to the world's biggest companies. Scott Guthrie's job is to reach some of the smallest.   Guthrie, who took over Microsoft's cloud business when Satya Nadella was elevated to chief executive officer in February, is spanning the globe, promoting the company's cloud tools to the rapidly evolving developer community.   In recent months, he's visited incubators in Singapore and China, and will be headed to Israel in early 2015, all in an effort to get a new generation of techies building on top of Microsoft. Next month he'll speak at Y Combinator, the prominent San Francisco start-up incubator, for the first time.    ""It's a good sign that we've seen so much developer interest lately,"" said Guthrie, executive vice president of the Redmond, Washington-based company's cloud and enterprise group. ""It's a good indication of how far the product has come.""   It's vitally important, because in cloud services, Microsoft (as well as rival Google), have a ways to go to catch up with market leader Amazon.com and its Web Services (AWS) division.   From $3.6 billion last year, cloud infrastructure will expand 31 percent a year through 2018, according to IDC. Amazon currently controls 40 percent of the market—also according to IDC—but the numbers are fuzzy because companies don't break out infrastructure sales. Synergy Research Group says Amazon has 27 percent market share, followed by Microsoft at 10 percent, IBM at 7 percent and Google at 5 percent.  Read MoreHow Microsoft is ensuring cloud security Microsoft's product Azure is the company's answer to Amazon, which has spent the past eight years welcoming start-ups and increasingly large businesses into its data centers, eliminating their need to own and manage servers and storage arrays.  What the experts and vendors agree upon is that the cloud is winning, and neither the Edward Snowden saga nor the occasional service outage will change the trajectory. A crazy idea just a few short years ago, cloud computing now has so much momentum that any tech company known for selling traditional hardware and packaged software faces legitimate existential threats.   Microsoft, in the minds of many, has been in that club. But since becoming CEO, Nadella has made it clear that cloud is the future. In the latest quarter, commercial cloud revenue surged 128 percent, compared with 11 percent total growth (excluding the Nokia business). Still, cloud only accounts for about 5 percent of Microsoft's sales, even though Azure was introduced more than five years ago.  Read MoreSony's plans for `The Interview'   ""They're as serious as a heart attack about going after that market,"" said Bernard Golden, author of Amazon Web Services for Dummies and vice president of strategy at ActiveState Software. ""Internally, they've woken up and said this is the path forward.""   The benefits of cloud speed and efficiency coupled with rapidly declining costs have all but eliminated the need for most companies to buy their own gear. AWS has cut prices 46 times since its 2006 launch, while Google has slashed prices 38 percent this year and is actually cheaper than AWS for many of its on-demand machines, according to an October blog post from cloud management provider RightScale. For either service, businesses are paying as little as 6 or 7 cents an hour for a server, and Microsoft has vowed to stay competitive on price.   Playing in this new world has forced Microsoft to alter its business model and dramatically change its mindset. Historically, the company was about selling Microsoft products, be they databases, servers, operating systems or desktop software packages.    By contrast, Seattle-based Amazon offers the latest and greatest technology and increasingly all the legacy stuff too, no matter who the vendor. Want to use an Oracle database or SAP application in the cloud? Amazon will let you. Need big data tools like Hadoop or advanced cyberprotection from Palo Alto Networks? No problem.   ""It's pretty hard to find an enterprise workload that isn't a technical fit to run on AWS,"" said Ariel Kelman, vice president of marketing at AWS. In 2014 alone, Amazon introduced more than 440 new features and services.   Microsoft has been adopting a similar playbook. Since mid-2013, the company has announced Azure partnerships with IBM, Oracle, SAP, Dell and others. In other words, Microsoft is now selling and supporting software from companies that have long been vicious competitors.  Read MoreHow the four horsemen of tech stack up   ""If you'd have suggested that five years ago, people would have thought you were crazy,"" Guthrie said. ""Customers are finally saying, `You're now an enterprise vendor I can trust beyond just running your own portfolio.'""    But what about sexy Internet start-ups that have grown up avoiding Microsoft's products? Again, the software giant is doing its best to change the narrative. Microsoft said in its October earnings report that 40 percent of Azure revenue already comes from start-ups and independent software vendors (ISVs). And by proactively reaching out to developers, Microsoft is ensuring them that Amazon isn't the only game in town.   It's a tough sell.   ""The reality is that Amazon is the 800-pound gorilla,"" said Dan Scholnick, who invests in software businesses at Silicon Valley venture firm Trinity Ventures. ""A big decision for start-ups is whose platform do you work to support. Right now it's very clearly Amazon.""    Read MoreAmazon spinoff in the cards?   Microsoft also has to contend with Google, which has $62 billion in cash, an employee base full of cloud-computing whiz kids and a promise to investors that it will be spending heavily on data center expansion.    Google's infrastructure product called Compute Engine was launched in 2012. Broadly, the pitch goes something like this: We've built the most sophisticated supercomputers in the world, capable of processing over 100 billion searches and 6 billion hours of YouTube videos every month. Wouldn't you like some of that magic in your servers?   ""Companies have realized that the real benefit of cloud is how do I make my company be more like the Web start-ups,"" said Greg DeMichillie, director of product management for the cloud platform at Mountain View, California-based Google.    Nadella was confronting this well before his ascent to CEO. While serving as executive vice president under long-time CEO Steve Ballmer, Nadella turned Azure from a tool designed for developers on Microsoft's proprietary .Net software and Windows machines to a platform for a much wider audience. Linux operating systems gained Azure support as did popular programming languages like Python and Ruby.Microsoft's cloud numbers can be a bit deceiving, because they include sales of Office 365, which the company introduced in 2011 to bring Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook) to the cloud.And the company still has work to do in selling its cloud services. Todd McKinnon, co-founder and CEO of software start-up Okta, cares more about Office 365. His company sells software to help businesses manage and secure the devices and apps their employees use. Office 365 is one of the most popular services used alongside Okta, McKinnon said, because companies are rapidly moving email and documents to the cloud.But servers and storage are a different story. McKinnon said that Okta's own computing infrastructure, consisting of 1,000 virtual machines, sits on top of AWS. Okta sends a monthly check to Amazon for $200,000, and McKinnon doesn't see anything from Microsoft that would get him to switch.  Read MoreGoogle shacks up with Equinix for cloud boost   ""Amazon is basically running unopposed,"" he said.   Guthrie suggests otherwise, and he points to some big contracts to prove it. They include 3M, GE Healthcare and Tesco's blinkbox movie-streaming business. NBC Sports also uses Azure to stream everything from English Premier League soccer to NFL ""Sunday Night Football."" (NBC Sports and CNBC are both part of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast.)  Whether Microsoft can win over the developer community is very much an open question. But the company knows that snagging a big piece of the cloud infrastructure market is vital at a time when plenty of old tech businesses are being swept into the dustbin of history.   ""We started this journey a couple years ago and we're continuing it this year,"" Guthrie said. ""It's rewarding to see a bunch of adoption happening."" "
871,2008-03-05T10:37:54-0500,"Yahoo has extended a deadline for nominating candidates to its board, giving the struggling Internet pioneer more time to search for a white knight to help it fight off an unwanted takeover bid from Microsoft.The announcement Wednesday comes amid published reports that Yahoo has stepped up discussions with Time Warner about acquiring or forming a joint venture with its AOL online unit to fend off the world's largest software company.Microsoft's bid, originally valued at $44.6 billion, or $31 per share, was made public Feb. 1. Yahoo has rejected the offer as too low, and it was expected Microsoft would nominate its own slate to the Yahoo board to push the deal through.Yahoo said the deadline for nominations would be 10 days after it announces the date of its annual shareholder meeting. The previous deadline was March 14.In a statement, Yahoo said the extension would allow its board ""to continue to explore all of its strategic alternatives for maximizing value for stockholders without the distraction of a proxy contest.""Yahoo and AOL declined comment on the reports Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times that Yahoo and Time Warner have stepped up discussions over AOL.One scenario calls for Yahoo to acquire AOL outright with Time Warner taking a minority stake in the combined company, the Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter.The Times, citing unnamed people close to Yahoo, said a Yahoo-AOL combination has the backing of Google, which owns 5 percent of AOL. and fears a Microsoft takeover of Yahoo.A Yahoo-AOL combination would create a stronger advertising-driven business that could ultimately compete with Internet search and advertising leader Google.Both AOL and Yahoo have strengths in emerging technologies for targeting ads based on users' Web surfing patterns, an approach that Google so far has shunned in favor of contextual, keyword-based placements.Yahoo also has been in discussions media conglomerate News Corp., the owner of the popular online hangout MySpace, a person familiar with the situation told The Associated Press.Yahoo and Time Warner have talked about a combination before, but the idea was rejected in 2005 because Time Warner at the time insisted that it retain majority ownership in the AOL unit, two people close to those discussions told the AP.

872,2008-02-14T13:31:13-0500,"Microsoft's hostile play for Yahoo certainly isn't lacking from strong opinions about the deal from experts on both sides of the argument. But the more interesting opinions are coming from the companies themselves.We've already heard from Microsoft . The company's conference call the day the offer was announced; the following Monday during the company's Strategic Update with investors and media. But since then, we've begun hearing from big shareholders from both companies, and the rhetoric is getting interesting. First, it was Masayoshi Son, Softbank's CEO, who declared Microsoft's acquisition of Yahoo could actually boost the Yahoo brand. The third largest Japanese mobile phone maker, Softbank owns about 4 percent of Yahoo shares, and 41 percent of Yahoo Japan, so a vote of confidence there carries some weight. Then came word earlier this weekthat Legg Mason , which owns 80 million Yahoo shares, doesn't see a deal happening without a higher offer from Microsoft. Well, duh. Of course Legg Mason wants to see a higher price. Now, we get the letter from Robert Olstein, who runs Olstein Capital Management which owns about a million Microsoft shares. He calls himself a 40-year Wall Street veteran and sent his note to Microsoft's CFO Chris Liddell and cc'd Steve Ballmer as well. His point is clear: ""Under no circumstances should you raise your price. We believe your recent offer for Yahoo is materially above Yahoo's value as an independent company."" He adds that Microsoft must be clear ""that you have offered a price that already dilutes Microsoft's shareholders. Your offer of one year ago was supposedly in the 40s. Today you are bidding in the low 30s. I believe you can buy at the present price or cheaper if you step away and play hard ball...In our opinion, it would be detrimental to shareholder value to pay up any further."" But that plain talk isn't persuading Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang who released a letter of his own to shareholders today, which surprisingly re-hashes many of the same points he has made these past couple of weeks. He writes: ""We have a huge market opportunity--and are uniquely positioned to capitalize on it...Today, Yahoo is a faster-moving, better organized, more nimble company that it was just a few months ago."" He adds that ""We are executing our strategy--and making headway."" And finally, ""This is a great company and we are moving quickly to make it even better."" The problem for Yang and his team is the credibility gap developing between Yahoo and investors. It's tough to believe that everything at the company is suddenly coming together against the backdrop of a $45 billion hostile bid from no less a predator than Microsoft. I'm still hearing anecdotes of internal paralysis, ego games, lack of leadership and frustration. I know Yahoo continues to look for workable alternatives to Microsoft, but as I've written, I think the News Corp. negotiations are a red herring. I think word of a dramatically higher bid from Microsoft is also a long shot at best. This is all unfolding like a pre-written script. Yahoo had a chance to massage the deal a year ago when it could have offered at least the appearance of market strength. Today, Yahoo's hands are tied, spending their time wringing instead of soothing. Let the letters continue to fly. Questions?  Comments?  TechCheck@cnbc.com"

874,2008-02-04T06:57:07-0500,"Microsoft said Monday its $44.6 billion unsolicited offer for Yahoo was priced to make it easy for the company to accept, and it expects Yahoo's board and shareholders to agree to the buyout quickly. ""We think it's a generous one,"" Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said in a presentation to investors. ""We trust the Yahoo board and the Yahoo shareholders will join with us quickly in deciding to move down an integrated path."" Microsoft's proposed acquisition of Yahoo would marry the world's biggest software maker with one of the leading Internet media companies, shaking up the market for online services such as email and advertising.However, Google, Yahoo's chief rival, expressed its opposition to the deal by alleging Microsoft could use Yahoo to gain illegal control over the Internet.Google's stance against the proposed deal isn't a surprise, given that Microsoft views Yahoo as a crucial weapon in its battle to gain ground on Google in the Internet's booming search and advertising markets. Yahoo so far has had little to say except that its board will carefully examine Microsoft's bid -- a process that ""can take quite a bit of time,"" according to a message posted on the Sunnyvale-based company's Web site. Google's critical remarks, posted online Sunday by the Mountain View-based company's top lawyer, represented its first public reaction to Microsoft's unsolicited bid for Yahoo since the offer was announced Friday. ""Microsoft's hostile bid for Yahoo raises troubling questions,"" David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, wrote. ""This is about more than simply a financial transaction, one company taking over another. It's about preserving the underlying principles of the Internet: openness and innovation."" Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft has been trying to depict a Yahoo takeover as a boon for both advertisers and consumers because the two companies together would be able to compete against Google more effectively. But Google is painting a starkly different picture, asserting that Microsoft will be able to stifle innovation and leverage its dominating Windows operating system to set up personal computers so consumers are automatically steered to online services, such as e-mail and instant messaging, controlled by the world's largest software maker. In a move that illustrates just how badly Google wants to torpedo the deal, Google Chief Executive Officer Eric Schmidt called Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang Friday to offer his help in repelling Microsoft, according to a report Sunday on The Wall Street Journal's Web site, which cited anonymous people familiar with the matter. The assistance didn't include a counterbid, but may have included supporting other potential suitors, or a revenue guarantee in exchange for an ad partnership with Yahoo, the people said, according the newspaper. AT&amp;T, Time Warner and News Corp. aren't planning to enter the bidding, the Journal said, citing the people familiar. To help make its point, Google pointed to the way Microsoft previously used Windows to help extend the reach of its Web browser and other applications -- a strategy that triggered a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit alleging the software maker illegally used its operating system to stifle competition. The dispute ended with a 2002 settlement that required Microsoft to abandon some of its past practices. ""Could Microsoft now attempt to exert the same sort of inappropriate and illegal influence over the Internet that it did with the PC?"" Drummond wrote. Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said preventing Microsoft from buying Yahoo would undermine competition by allowing Google to become even more dominant than it already is on the Internet ""Microsoft is committed to openness, innovation, and the protection of privacy on the Internet,"" Smith said. ""We believe that the combination of Microsoft and Yahoo will advance these goals."" If they get together, Microsoft and Yahoo would have about 16 percent of the worldwide Internet search market -- still far behind Google's 62 percent share, according to comScore Media Metrix. But Microsoft and Yahoo already are far bigger in than Google in e-mail and instant messaging, and conceivably would be in a better position to squash rival services if they combined. Illustrating the enormous stakes involved in a deal that could reshape the technology and media industries, Google and Microsoft are already debating the pros and cons before Yahoo has responded to the offer. In its Web site posting, Yahoo has said its review of the proposal ""will include evaluating all of the company's strategic alternatives, including maintaining Yahoo as an independent company."" Most analysts believe Yahoo will have little choice but to sell to Microsoft, with its stock price near a four-year low at the time of the bid and its profits falling since late 2006. When it was first announced, Microsoft's offer was 62 percent above Yahoo's market value -- a premium analysts doubt any other suitor will be able to top. If Yahoo accepts, antitrust regulators in both the United States and Europe are expected to begin an exhaustive review that some experts think could last a year. Microsoft believes it could get the necessary approvals to take over Yahoo late this year. ""It's a very defensive display of fear against what it appears to be a new empire, which is Google,"" Aleksandra Bosnjak, an analyst at StrategyEye Digital Media, told ""Worldwide Exchange."" ""Short-term I don't think there will be any implications for Google. Long-term, however, Microsoft is likely to put some interesting things against Google,"" Bosnjak said. If nothing else, Google's comments probably will try to raise enough alarms about the Microsoft-Yahoo deal to delay its approval for as long as possible. By doing so, Google would have more time to draw up plans to counteract the combination. Google also is borrowing a page from Microsoft's book by urging antitrust regulators to take a hard look at the proposed marriage between its two rivals. Just days after Google struck a $3.1 billion deal to buy online ad service DoubleClick Inc. last year, Microsoft began lobbying regulators to block the transaction. U.S. regulators blessed Google's DoubleClick acquisition late last year after an eight-month review, but the antitrust inquiry in Europe remains open. --The Associated Press contributed to this report.--CNBC.com has business relationships with both Yahoo and Microsoft."

878,2018-12-17T20:02:33-0500,"The World Economic Forum report highlights a troubling gender gap in AI jobs and says proactive measures are needed to change the ratio.Big companies have already suffered glitches in their AI systems.Artificial intelligence has permeated the technology universe with the promise of disrupting every industry, from health care and retail to transportation.But a new report from the World Economic Forum suggests that the market developing around AI has certain problems that look a lot like the rest of the corporate world. The WEF report released on Monday found that the AI workforce in the U.S. has a dramatic gender gap, with less than one-fourth of roles in the industry being filled by women.""It is absolutely crucial that those people who create AI are representative of the population as a whole,"" said Kay Firth-Butterfield, WEF's head of artificial intelligence and machine learning.Firth-Butterfield said that bias can enter the coding process, so a lack of diversity means ""we're not actually reflecting the population and we have a huge problem.""The analysis found that the AI gender gap is three times larger than other industry talent pools, and women in AI are less likely to be positioned in high-profile senior roles.The disparity has real-world implications. In 2016, Microsoft released a chatbot named ""Tay"" on Twitter as an experiment in conversational learning. The experiment quickly ran into problems as Twitter users started tweeting at the bot with misogynistic and racist comments, and ""Tay"" started repeating that sentiment back to users. More recently, Google released a predictive text feature within Gmail where the algorithm made biased assumptions referring to a nurse with female pronouns. Google eventually stopped the feature from suggesting pronouns.Firth-Butterfield also pointed to the fact that our most popular virtual assistants from Apple, Amazon and Google have female voices and are designed to serve and take orders.Programmers ""are replicating the fact that people who take calls in call centers tend to be women but we could create a different world with AI if we had more diverse teams creating [it],"" she said.Not all the benefits of diversity are immediately obvious, but the report says that changing the ratio will require proactive measures.""When you bring more people into the field you get more creative outcomes,"" said Tess Posner, CEO of AI4All, a non-profit working to increase diversity in fields including artificial intelligence. Firth-Butterfield and Posner both argue that companies with greater diversity perform better. ""We see that diversity improves innovation, and the technology itself,"" Posner said. If people from a variety of backgrounds are building AI systems, ""it will better reflect society,"" she said.﻿"

882,2014-11-11T14:43:04-0500,"  Fuel cell proponents like to talk about how the devices can use biogas to create zero-carbon power, but that actually doesn't happen very often. Typically, natural gas is the fuel that feeds the electrochemical process.  Not so at the Microsoft Data Plant in Cheyenne, Wyoming, however. This data center was built alongside a wastewater treatment plant, where anaerobic digesters break down you-know-what to produce the gas that feeds the fuel cells that keep the electronics humming.  FuelCell Energy provided the fuel cells, while Siemens engineered and installed the power monitoring equipment.   Mind you, this data center is not a key part of Microsoft's global infrastructure. The IT server container demands just 200 kilowatts, and Microsoft said that after 18 months of use, it will ""donate the Data Plant infrastructure to the participating Wyoming communities, including the University of Wyoming, for further research."" The state put in $1.5 million of the $7.6 million cost of the project.  Read MoreAmerica now No. 1 in wind power   That's pricey for a 300-kilowatt power system (the extra power helps run the wastewater treatment plant), but at the official opening in Cheyenne last week, Sean James, senior research program manager for Microsoft's Datacenter Advanced Development team, pointed to the value of taking real steps toward the holy grail of energy generation – clean, closed-loop systems.   ""A lot of people talk about what could happen,"" James said. ""Today is about what is actually happening.""   Data centers are an appropriate target for such novel ventures because the centers are rapidly growing energy consumers. According to researchers at the Berkeley Lab, ""In 2000, U.S. data centers used less than 0.12 percent of the nation's energy; by 2010, that figure had grown to about 2 percent.""  More from Breaking Energy:  Underground coal gasification gets new start in US Saudi oil export concerns detailed; renewable energy opportunities identified  Energy career advice from top BP trading strategist Dawn Constantin  In Utah last year, eBay opened a data center that uses several megawatts of fuel cells from Bloom Energy as its primary energy source, with the grid as backup. At the time, eBay said the fuel cells ""will be powered by biogas."" What eBay meant was that the fuel cells would use natural gas, but the company would pay to bring more biogas onto the gas grid. This is known as ""directed biogas.""   But when eBay celebrated the opening of the Utah data center a year later, it didn't mention biogas. Instead, eBay said it was turning to Ormat Technologies to develop a ""recovered energy generation"" (REG) power plant nearby. Here's how that works: Natural gas is compressed to ""push"" it through pipelines. Compression stations every 50 or so miles keep the gas moving. The compression process yields hot exhaust. At an REG, that hot exhaust is recovered by using heat exchangers, the heat is used to vaporize a fluid, and the vapor is used to spin an electricity-generating turbine.   Elegant as this solution is – eBay is using natural gas, true, but it's using natural gas as efficiently as possible – it only highlights the challenge of running fuel cells on biogas. Even directed biogas can be hard to come by in the U.S., despite the fact that potential sources are abundant. The National Association of Clean Water Agencies estimates that energy generated at U.S. wastewater treatment plants could meet as much as 12 percent of U.S. energy demand. Read MoreT Boone Pickens: The real problem with oil  Germany is the world's biggest user of biogas, which accounts for around 4.5 percent of the country's electricity, typically generated using combustion motors. That's a solution with modest capital costs, but FuelCell Energy, the fuel cell provider for the Wyoming project, notes that generating electricity by burning biogas isn't as efficient as using biogas in an electrochemical reaction, nor as clean.   Don Collins of the Western Research Institute, a participant in the Wyoming pilot project, highlighted another potential advantage of using fuel cells: Certain types of fuel cells can capture carbon dioxide and deliver a very pure CO2 stream, which could theoretically be utilized to take the whole system from zero to negative carbon emissions.  —Pete Danko, Breaking Energy "
883,2014-11-08T14:00:00-0500,"  In the Xbox universe, there's ""Halo"" —and there's everything else. The venerable franchise has sold more than 60 million copies to date and shows no signs of slowing down.   While the Master Chief and his crew cast a big shadow, Microsoft has actually put together a strong catalog of other go-to franchises along the way, including ""Gears of War"" and ""Fable"". In late October, it published its latest effort to build another franchise: ""Sunset Overdrive"".    The game, which was developed by ""Ratchet and Clank"" creators Insomniac Games is what's called a ""first party"" title in the industry: something published by the console maker and is exclusive to their game system (in this case, the Xbox One).    And first party games are a critical part of any console's success. Microsoft has ""Halo;"" Sony  has ""Uncharted,"" and Nintendo has ""Super Mario(and more).""     Read MoreActivision gets out big guns for Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare   Historically, Microsoft hasn't talked much about how it picks games to publish under its label. However, the software giant's game gurus sat down with CNBC to go through the process.   Rule one: Rookie developers don't stand much of a chance.   ""Most of these projects begin not as somebody coming up for the first time and us looking at a proposal or video,"" says Matt Booty, general manager of Microsoft Studios. ""They are the culmination of a longer relationship—and really knowing a developer well enough to be able to talk about what their passion is and what they want to make, so that we can get behind them.""   That's not to say that game makers who don't already have a hit to their name are shut out. Ken Lobb, creative director at Microsoft Studios, says the company also likes to look at the potential levels of smaller studios.   Read More Judge dismisses Manuel Noriega's 'Call of Duty' lawsuit   ""It's easy to look at a game like 'Sunset Overdrive' and say you're looking to sign AAA studios to make AAA games,"" he says. ""And that's true. But I see lots of pitches and I play lots of games. I like to find a developer that feels like they haven't been put in the right situation to make a AAA game.""   This sort of thinking led the company to partner with the relatively unknown Moon Studios to create ""Ori and the Blind Forest,"" due later this year.   Rule two: Realistic ambition and unbridled passion turn heads   The single most important thing, Booty and Lobb agree, is that a developer must have an unbridled enthusiasm for the game they want to make—and have the skills to back that up.    ""I want to be able to look across a table at a creative leader and see that the idea they're talking about is what they really want to make,"" Lobb told CNBC. ""Of course, there are lots of technical questions, but first and foremost, it's creative visionaries who have this passion and want to build something,"" he added. ""Then the next question is: Is this group capable of building this vision?""  Read More Wal-Mart beefs up its used game business  Rule three: Play well with others   The process of creating a major game is a time consuming process that can take more than a year, and eveloper desires and publisher demands don't always sync well. Microsoft assembles a team of producers and other back end personnel with a lot of collective video game industry experience. It's key that both parties are able to communicate effectively and work through differences amicably.    ""It really is very much relationship-based,"" says Booty. ""For us, publishing is about relationship development. If you form that, you get trust - and a shared excitement. ... Someone once told me that a video game gets made by the 50 decisions that get made every day and those decisions add up over two years.""  Rule four: An undying love for older games can pay off   While big hits pay the bills at Microsoft's entertainment division, beloved games that fall flat aren't always left behind. Sometimes, against all odds, a flop can take on cult status. That, in turn, can prompt Microsoft to try again. if a developer has never stopped loving (or playing) the original, that can be a big bonus. When Microsoft decided to reboot the ""Killer Instinct"" arcade game on Xbox One, it reversed its usual policy of having its business development team bring development teams in. Instead, Lobb gave that group marching orders to reach out to a small pool of developers, out of which Microsoft teamed with two to make the game. It did the same thing recently when it decided to revive ""Phantom Dust,"" a critically loved, but commercial failure, from the original Xbox.Read More'Halo' creators' 'Destiny' tops sales expectations  Rule five: Don't be a copycat   Too many developers think that the hunt for the next ""Halo"" means they have to approach the company with a game (or genre) that follows in the exact same footprints of the megahit. That's not true, says Booty. Instead, Microsoft looks for something that will showcase what's unique about the Xbox platform.    ""Clearly there is a portfolio level of thinking that goes on,"" adds Lobb. ""We don't need more games in the same family as 'Halo' or 'Gears of War,' so we'd be less likely to pick up a first person shooter because that portfolio is full."" "

888,2007-09-24T16:02:03-0400,"Microsoft is talking to Facebook about an investment in the company that could value the fast-growing social network at $10 billion or more, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Monday.Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal said the world's largest software company sought to buy a stake of up to 5 percent in Facebook for $300 million to $500 million. Facebook, led by its 23-year-old founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, may insist on a valuation as high as $15 billion and is considering raising up to $500 million in cash to expand its operations, according to the Journal. Such a deal could help Microsoft better compete against Web search leader Google for email users and a growing base of Internet advertising. Google has also expressed an interest in investing in Facebook, the Journal report said. Facebook, which allows members to seek out a circle of friends and share online activities, has seen speculation over a potential partnership or buyout intensify as it rapidly expands its base of users and advertisers. It has grown to 39 million members, up nearly 63 percent from 24 million in late May and is quickly gaining ground against larger rival MySpace, owned by News Corp.Microsoft shares rose 2.5 percent to $29.36 in late trading on the Nasdaq.

These shortcomings contrast with assurances made by the company.In recent weeks, investigators conducted undercover tests of Facebook's safety controls and procedures, posing as underage users. Cuomo's investigators found they were solicited by adult sexual predators on Facebook and could access pornographic images and videos.A spokeswoman for the privately held company declined to comment immediately but said the company was aware of the subpoena and preparing a statement."

I think this is going to lift the stock to that 52-week high,"" said Jon Najarian of OptionMonster.com. ""Last year was a 13 P/E, now it's a 17 P/E and part of the reason of that is excitement about Azure, with the cloud and so forth, what Microsoft's doing in gaming … I think there's a lot to be happy and satisfied about the direction that Microsoft's going.""

890,2014-10-23T09:03:00-0400," Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella is finding a surprising fanbase among developers for his concerted push to forge partnerships and expand the cloud ecosystem. But getting investors excited largely depends on limiting the damage elsewhere.   In his third earnings report since taking the reins from longtime chief Steve Ballmer in February, Nadella will surely tout his progress in pushing Microsoft's cloud business via a host of new deals and products.     That unit accounts for only about 5 percent of revenue.   Microsoft remains saddled with an aging software licensing business and a market-lagging mobile unit, highlighting the challenges Nadella faces in his effort to reignite overall growth. It's a theme that will be on prominent display in the company's report after the closing bell Thursday.  Read MoreMicrosoft CEO on women's pay   ""We are generally positive on the direction and efforts from the new CEO,"" BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis wrote in an Oct. 14 report.

The shares fell 1.1 percent on Wednesday to close at $44.38. They were higher in premarket trading Thursday. (For the latest price, click here.)  Analysts are expecting the Redmond, Washington-based software maker to report a 20 percent decline in fiscal first-quarter net income to $4.1 billion, or 50 cents a share, from $5.2 billion, or 62 cents, a year earlier, according to a Thomson Reuters survey. Revenue is expected to increase 19 percent to $22 billion. The drop in profit reflects, in part, a surge in sales and marketing costs.    Licensing sales in Microsoft's consumer device business is declining, while its commercial licenses for flagship Windows products is hardly growing.    As the old model of having clients pay for software tied to individual machines shifts to the cloud, Microsoft is investing to spread adoption of its Office 365 Web-based tools and its Azure infrastructure, which competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS).   Earlier this week, Microsoft announced a partnership with Dell to bundle Azure on the hardware company's servers. It also forged an alliance with red-hot start-up Docker, which provides tools for developers to build apps and distribute them anywhere.    ""We view these announcements positively and expect Microsoft Azure to continue to gain traction as customers migrate to the cloud,"" wrote Nomura Securities analyst Rick Sherlund, who recommends buying the shares and has a $50 price target. The enhancements will enable Microsoft ""to compete better against AWS and Google,"" he wrote. Read MoreBox IPO: Why the delay?  Microsoft partnered with Box last year, allowing users of the cloud collaboration software to work within Azure, and more recently Box said it will integrate with Office 365. Box CEO Aaron Levie, a regular critic of Microsoft in the Ballmer days, is now openly praising the company and Nadella.   In the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft's commercial cloud sales jumped 147 percent. That growth put the business on pace for $4.4 billion in annual revenue, while total sales this fiscal year are expected to approach $100 billion.   Another focus for investors as the holidays approach will be Microsoft's gaming business. The company's computing and gaming hardware unit includes the Xbox and Surface Pro tablet, products that are increasingly competing against devices from Apple and Google.  Brad Reback, an analyst at Stifel, expects Microsoft to report 29 percent growth in that unit to $1.91 billion. The current quarter, which wraps in the holidays, will likely see 6.6 percent year-over-year expansion to $5 billion, Reback predicts."

893,2014-10-20T08:21:57-0400," Microsoft has already proven its potency in the cloud era, and is one of three companies with the scale, resources, and know-how to dominate the booming $100 billion market, CEO Satya Nadella told CNBC.  In his first television interview since becoming the software giant's third CEO, Nadella focused on Microsoft's cloud ambitions. He also talked about why he won't spin off Microsoft's consumer properties and how he's changing the model of the company's prized Windows business.   And for the first time, he answered an interviewer's questions about his controversial comments on women in the workplace. (CNBC will report on his comments later in the day.)  Nadella is nine months into the CEO role, and sought to frame the cloud infrastructure market as a battle between a handful of giants.   ""If you're not already spending a lot of capital in the order of four or five billion dollars each year to just grow your cloud, probably it's a little too late to enter the market,"" he said. ""In our case we've been committing it for multiple years and we're not alone. There are at least two other players like that, Amazon and Google in particular, but we are one of the three in that category. One of the things that we've really invested in is this enterprise cloud—we have data centers in 19 countries. We have made sure we get the certifications to operate under the various regulatory regimes for vertical industries like financial services, or different countries' data sovereignty laws. That's hard work. China is a great example. In fact, we now are the only public cloud company from North America, or global public cloud company, that operates in China. Both Office 365 and Azure. And it's doing very, very well for us.""  The comments are controversial in part because ""cloud"" has become the favorite buzzword in business technology, on par with what ""dot-com"" was 15 years ago. The term includes three distinct areas: Software as a Service includes companies such as Salesforce and Workday, which offer their products over the Internet. Infrastructure as a Service includes companies like Amazon and Google that let companies rent resources—such as servers and storage—rather than buy them. And Platform as a Service includes Amazon, Google, and Salesforce, and seeks to provide a straightforward way for companies to write custom cloud software.  Microsoft, Nadella argues, is positioned to do well in all three areas. It already has one of the major cloud software suites, Office 365. Its Azure cloud service also offers both infrastructure and platform as a service.  ""In the cloud I would say we absolutely caught the trend. It's no longer about, 'Hey, is Microsoft in the cloud business.' We have a $4.5 billion business that's growing well and it's fantastic to see. It's just that in relation to our success of $70 billion it's a small business. But the overall magnitude of our cloud business today shows that we've caught the trend at the right time, jumped on it with a unique value proposition and we're now further accelerating,"" he said. ""In all of these cases, there will always be some price competition by someone on these various layers. I mean, ultimately there are only two things that I think you compete on. You compete on value, you compete on price. And depending on which layer against which competitor at what time, the equation changes. But our own theory — for example, one of the things that has happened is as we have grown our cloud, especially around infrastructure, one of the things that has grown nicely for us is our server business. It's not, at least in the short term or the intermediate term, zero sum.""   Nadella also waved off calls for Microsoft to split its consumer business from its enterprise-focused cloud efforts.   ""One of the things that's really been key to our success — the way, even, our footprint in the enterprise grew — is because of what I term as dual-use. People using Windows and Office for their personal use, and taking it to work,"" he said. ""So to us, the way I characterize it is, let's go after the users and their dual use. In fact, I want us to shine, and want to be the best in class around people who are these dual users, who want to use things which are our tools, our platforms for their home as well as work, and it crosses over.""

It also plans to launch a new model, Xbox 360 Elite, that will ship with a 120 gigabyte hard disk and cost 449.99 euros.The European price of the entry-level model Xbox 360 Core, which does not include a hard drive, will be cut by 20 euros to 279.99 euros, Microsoft said.Earlier this month, Microsoft announced a price cut by about 13% for its main Xbox 360 model in the United States, hoping to boost sales ahead of the crucial holiday season.Microsoft reduced the U.S. price of the Xbox 360 Premium model by $50 to $350. Sony had previously cut the price of its PlayStation 3 machine by 17 percent to $500.Faced with unexpectedly strong competition from Nintendo's cheaper Wii console, Microsoft is aiming at expanding the appeal of the Xbox 360 to an audience outside its core fan base of young men.The rising sophistication of consoles, which boast graphics performance that rivals personal computers costing several times as much, means manufacturers are more reluctant to drop prices. That's particularly true for Microsoft, which has yet to turn a profit on the Xbox business it launched in 2001 in a bid to challenge Sony's growing dominance in the living room.By the end of June, Microsoft had sold 5.6 million Xbox 360s in the United States, compared with 2.8 million Wiis and 1.4 million PS3s -- the latter two launched a year later."
895,2018-09-04T06:00:00-0400,"SANTIAGO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Amazon.com is in talks with Chile to house and mine massive amounts of data generated by the country's giant telescopes, which could prove fertile ground for the company to develop new artificial intelligence tools.The talks, which have been little reported on so far and which were described to Reuters by Chilean officials and an astronomer, are aimed at fueling growth in Amazon.com Inc's cloud computing business in Latin America and boosting its data processing capabilities.President Sebastian Pinera's center-right government, which is seeking to wean Chile's $325 billion economy from reliance on copper mining, announced last week it plans to pool data from all its telescopes onto a virtual observatory stored in the cloud, without giving a timeframe. The government talked of the potential for astrodata innovation, but did not give details.The government did not comment on companies that might host astrodata in the computing cloud.Amazon executives have been holding discussions with the Chilean government for two years about a possible data center to provide infrastructure for local firms and the government to store information on the cloud, an official at InvestChile, the government's investment body, told Reuters.For at least some of that time, the talks have included discussion about the possibility of Amazon Web Services (AWS), hosting astrodata, astronomer Chris Smith said, based on email exchanges he was part of between AWS and Chilean Economy Ministry officials over the last six months. Smith was at the time mission head of AURA observatory, which manages three of the U.S. federally-funded telescope projects in Chile.Jeffrey Kratz, AWS's General Manager for Public Sector for Latin American, Caribbean and Canada, has visited Chile for talks with Pinera. He confirmed the company's interest in astrodata but said Amazon had no announcements to make at present.""Chile is a very important country for AWS,"" he said in an email to Reuters. ""We kept being amazed about the incredible work on astronomy and the telescopes, as real proof points on innovation and technology working together.""""The Chilean telescopes can benefit from the cloud by eliminating the heavy lifting of managing IT,"" Kratz added.AWS is a fast-growing part of Amazon's overall business. In July it reported second-quarter sales of $6.1 billion, up by 49 percent over the same period a year ago, accounting for 12 percent of Amazon's overall sales.STAR-GAZING TO SHOP-LIFTINGChile is home to 70 percent of global astronomy investment, thanks to the cloudless skies above its northern Atacama desert, the driest on earth. Within five years, the South American country will host three of the world's four next-generation, billion-dollar telescopes, according to Smith.He and Economy Ministry officials leading the Chilean initiative to store astrodata in the cloud saw potential in more Earth-bound matters.The particular tools developed for the astrodata project could be applicable for a wide variety of other uses, such as tracking potential shop-lifters, fare-evaders on public transport and endangered animals, Julio Pertuze, a ministry official, told Reuters at the event announcing Chile's aim to build a virtual observatory on the cloud.Smith added that the same technology could also be applied to medicine and banking to spot anomalies in large datasets.Amazon, whose founder and largest shareholder Jeff Bezos is well known for his interest in space, already provides a cloud platform for the Hubble Telescope's data and the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research in Australia.As Amazon explores the potential in Chile's astrodata, tech rival Google, owned by Alphabet Inc, is already a member of Chile's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which will be fully operational in Cerro Pachon in 2022. Google also has a data center established in the country.Justin Burr, senior PR associate for AI and Machine learning at Google, declined to comment on any Google plans around astrodata or its involvement in other telescope projects.Separately, a Google spokeswoman said last week that the company will announce expansion plans for its Chilean data center on Sept. 12.GIANT DATABASESmith said that what the Chileans are calling the Astroinformatics Initiative - to harness the potential of astrodata - could enable Amazon Web Services access to the research that astronomers are doing on projects like the LSST.""We are going to have to go through a huge database of billions of stars to find the three stars that an astronomer wants,"" Smith said, adding that was not too different from searching a database of billions of people to find the right profile for a targeted advertisement.""So a tool that might get developed in LSST or the astronomical world could be applicable for Amazon in their commercial world.""Since speaking to Reuters, Smith has moved on from his job heading AURA to a new position at the U.S. National Science Foundation.Amazon's role in the astrodata project would also give it an entry into a market where it is seeking to expand. Amazon - which controls nearly one-third of the global cloud computing business, ahead of rivals Microsoft Corp and Google - has struggled to lure public institutions in Latin America, including research facilities, to store their data online instead of on physical machines.AWS declined to provide any information on the size of its regional business in Latin America.Economy Minister Jose Ramon Valente said at last week's announcement, ""Chile has enormous potential in its pristine skies not only in the observation of the universe but also in the amount of data that observation generates.""

897,2014-10-13T07:57:11-0400,"  A well-known picture in tech circles, taken in 1978, shows the first 11 employees at Microsoft. Two are women. One of them left two years later after a pay dispute.   Almost four decades later, the ratio has improved: About a third of Microsoft's 110,000 or so employees are women. But the company's pay practices and attitude toward women are still open to question and will likely be taken up at the board level, according to one director, Maria Klawe.Read MoreMicrosoft CEO apologizes for gender pay gap comments  The issue hit the headlines and social media on Thursday when new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella suggested women in tech shouldn't ask for pay raises but should instead trust the system and rely on ""karma"" to get what they deserve.    He later said he was wrong, but the damage was done, reinforcing the view that Microsoft—and the tech industry generally—is a boys' club.    ""He blew that question,"" said Klawe in a telephone interview on Friday. ""He's retracted it. I think it's going to take us all to a better place. I'm pretty sure he's going to be thinking really hard about pay equity.""  It was Klawe, a longtime campaigner for women in tech, who asked Nadella the question onstage on Thursday that led to his remarks, and she has since led the company's efforts at damage limitation.  Klawe, 63, said she has been pressing for hiring and promoting women at Microsoft since she joined the board five years ago, but the issue of pay raises for women had not been discussed by the board.  Read MoreWhat Microsoft CEO's comments say about tech world  ""I suspect it might be now,"" she said.   Klawe pointed to the recruitment of Peggy Johnson from Qualcomm as head of business development in September as a recent success, but she conceded there have been backward steps, notably the ousting of Tami Reller and Julie Larson-Green, who ran the flagship Windows unit until a shakeup in 2013.    ""I did feel badly that we had Tami and Julie on the executive team and then had two fewer people. But it really had to do with what made sense in terms of who was the right person for which job,"" said Klawe. ""I'm sure we'll see more women in those levels.""    Reller has since left Microsoft, while Larson-Green is responsible for the overall look and feel of Microsoft's software services.   Boys' club   Microsoft has never been a beacon of diversity.   Karin Carter, who worked at the company in its heyday from 1983 until 1997 and went on to write a book about the experience, said there were only five or so women programmers at Microsoft when she joined, with the vast majority of women in support positions.   ""The first time my fellow administrative assistant and I worked all night to get materials ready for a meeting, we got roses from the vice president of the international group,"" said Carter. ""My first thought was, 'Roses? How about money?'""    Today the numbers are slightly better. Microsoft's 15-strong senior leadership team, which runs the company day to day, has three women: Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood; Lisa Brummel, head of human resources; and recent hire Johnson.  Read MoreMicrosoft's Nadella apologizes. Now what?   Its board of 12 also has three women: former Wall Street banker Dina Dublon; Klawe, president of Harvey Mudd College; and most recently Teri List-Stoll, chief financial officer of Kraft Foods Group.   But the issue of unequal pay looms large.    Numbers from job site Glassdoor show that men tend to earn more doing a similar job than women at Microsoft, though the data is far from complete and based on voluntary disclosure.   For example, a male Microsoft senior software development engineer makes about $137,000 per year, according to Glassdoor, compared with about $129,000 for women. Microsoft declined to comment or provide data on what it pays staff.    Microsoft is not alone. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that men earn 24 percent more, on average, than women in the tech sector. In computer and mathematical occupations, men working full-time make a median average of $1,452 per week, compared with $1,174 per week for women.   The pay gap, and how to close it, was brought to public attention last year by Facebook Chief Operating OfficerSheryl Sandberg in her book ""Lean In."" She wrote that for women, negotiating is ""like trying to cross a minefield backward in high heels."" Women who push for higher salaries are viewed as more demanding than men who do the same, she writes, and pay costs ""in goodwill and future advancement.""   The Microsoft furor may yet lead to improvement, said one campaigner.    ""Nadella's reaction was likely based on what he thinks men do—work hard and get rewarded—rather than recognizing that what they actually do is work hard, talk about the hard work they are doing and then get rewarded,"" said Meiko Takayama, founder of Advancing Women Executives, an advocacy group. ""If positioned in the right way, this can be a learning moment for everyone."" "

Texas Instruments - The stock declined modestly after the chipmaker handed in earnings of 76 cents per share or revenue of $3.27 billion, boosted by higher demand from automakers. Wall Street expected it to report profit of 69 cents per share on sales of $3.36 billion.   United Technologies - The chipmaker beat Street expectations, but shares fell about 2 percent after the firm slashed its full-year forecasts due to negative impact of a stronger dollar.

899,2014-10-13T17:12:29-0400,"  Young women entering the business world are often advised to find a savvy mentor who can guide their progress up the corporate ladder.  So you might think that having 24/7 access to the CEO of a Fortune 500 company would provide a huge advantage.  However, this may not be true for the two daughters of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.  Based on recent events, for example, one can imagine the following discussion in the Nadella household:  Daughter: ""Daddy, my responsibilities have greatly expanded in the past couple of years, but my salary has remained the same.  Should I talk to my boss about a raise?""  Satya: ""No, dear, you really need to have faith that the system is giving you the right raises as you go along.""  Daughter: ""But, Daddy, if I'm being underpaid, shouldn't I ask for what deserve?""  Satya: ""Women who don't ask for raises actually have a kind of superpower, because it makes them someone that others want to trust.  It creates good karma which will come back to you.""  Daughter: ""Huh?"" Read MoreAfter gaffe, Microsoft board to look at gender pay gap, male culture  Given the extensive news coverage, by now you have undoubtedly heard the actual comments upon which this hypothetical conversation is based.  But to refresh your memory, here is what Mr. Nadella said at a conference which is billed as the largest gathering of women technologists:    ""It's not really about asking for the raise, but knowing and having faith that the system will actually give you the right raises as you go along.  And I think that might be one of the additional superpowers that, quite frankly, women who don't ask for a raise have.  Because that's good karma.  It'll come back, because somebody is going to know that is the kind of person that I want to trust.""   What CEOs really think   This inane comment, which came towards the end of a rather relaxed on-stage interview with the female president of Harvey Mudd College, likely represents an unguarded moment in which Mr. Nadella gave us a glimpse of what CEOs actually think:  ""I wish that our employees would stop whining about pay and just take what we give them.""     Similarly, the ""superpower"" to which Mr. Nadella refers is the tendency of many women to be accepting and unassertive in matters of compensation.  This makes them ""the kind of person I want to trust"" because they seldom cause management any discomfort.  But while these compliant souls may be trusted, they are definitely not rewarded.    Read MoreWaaaah! How to deal with childish behavior at work   Unfortunately, women often buy into this ""good little girl"" persona from the beginning of their employment.  Unlike their male counterparts, they fail to negotiate starting salaries and simply accept whatever offer they are given.  Because they are also more reluctant to ask for raises, over time their pay falls farther and farther behind.   Which brings us to Mr. Nadella's reference to karma.  According to Wikipedia, karma can be defined as ""that which explains the present circumstances of an individual with reference to his or her actions in the past"".  And in that sense, karma is indeed at play here, because if you fail to ask for what you deserve, odds are you will never receive it.   After 22 years at Microsoft, Mr. Nadella's total annual compensation is now reported to be in the neighborhood of $7.6 million.  So here's the obvious question: did he reach that lofty level by taking his own advice and trusting the system?  Or did he demonstrate self-confidence and assertiveness by negotiating his salary at appropriate points during his career?  There's no way to find out, of course, but I know where I'm placing my bets.   To be fair to Mr. Nadella, he did apologize for his remarks.  Unfortunately, in his first stab at contrition, he simply said he had been ""inarticulate.""  (""Idiotic"" would have been more accurate.)  But in the version that appeared after a thorough scrubbing by the PR folks, he changed his tone and reversed course.   ____________________________________________________________  Here's the final apology:  From: Satya Nadella Sent: Thursday, October 9, 2014 5:24 PM To: Microsoft – All Employees (QBDG); Retail: All FTE Subject: RE: Empowering Others   All – Today I was interviewed on stage by Maria Klawe at the Grace Hopper Conference – I encourage you to watch the video. It was great to spend time with so many women passionate about technology. I was honored to be a part of it and I left the conference energized and inspired.   Toward the end of the interview, Maria asked me what advice I would offer women who are not comfortable asking for pay raises. I answered that question completely wrong. Without a doubt I wholeheartedly support programs at Microsoft and in the industry that bring more women into technology and close the pay gap. I believe men and women should get equal pay for equal work. And when it comes to career advice on getting a raise when you think it's deserved, Maria's advice was the right advice. If you think you deserve a raise, you should just ask.   I said I was looking forward to the Grace Hopper Conference to learn, and I certainly learned a valuable lesson. I look forward to speaking with you at our monthly Q&amp;A next week and am happy to answer any question you have.   Satya (You can read it here on the Microsoft web site.)  ____________________________________________________________  Here's how you REALLY do it   Here's my advice to anyone, male or female, who gets queasy at the thought of saying to their boss, ""I would like to talk about my pay.""   First, you need to understand that managers are hardly ever surprised, much less offended, when an employee raises the subject of a pay increase.  That doesn't mean you'll get what you want, but it does mean that the subject is hardly taboo.     Second, you must do your homework and develop a solid business case for your request.  I addressed the specifics of this process in a commentary earlier this year (link to my commentary on ""How to Ask for a Raise"").  And finally, just screw up your courage and do it!   Worst case, your boss will say no, then you can politely ask when the best time would be to discuss the subject again.     By the way, should Mr. Nadella happen to read this piece, I would like to assure him that I have absolutely no ax to grind with either him or his company.  In fact, just last week I purchased a new Microsoft Surface tablet, which has ironically made it much easier to write this column while I'm on vacation.

900,2014-10-10T10:30:15-0400,"  Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella has apologized for the gender pay gap comments he made on Thursday at the Grace Hopper conference.   ""This is the first real black eye from Nadella since he took over for Ballmer. To his credit he apologized quickly, but this does shed light on a real issue—that women are being paid less than their male counterparts in Silicon Valley and that there's a real gender gap,"" said Edward Baig, tech columnist for USA Today.  Microsoft posted a memo from Nadella on its website that addressed his comments made at the conference. He states that he answered the question ""completely wrong"" and that he thinks ""men and women should get equal pay for equal work.""

Interviewee Maria Klawe, the president of the Harvey Mudd College, retorted that Nadella's comments were one of the ""very few things"" on which she disagreed with him. Klawe's response received a round of applause in the Phoenix Convention Center and the debate continued on social networking sites like Twitter.

A study by the non-profit initiative Measure of America back in 2012 concluded that men earned more than women in every racial and ethnic group. In Silicon Valley, the report showed that women earn 49 cents for every dollar that men earn. Microsoft currently employs 128,076 people worldwide with 28 percent being female.  In his apology, Nadella added that he agreed with the advice given by Klawe at the event. The computer scientist said that women should ""do their homework.""  ""Make sure you actually know what a reasonable salary is if you are being offered a job. Do not be as stupid as I was. Second thing is, role-play. Sit down with somebody you really trust and practice asking them for the salary you deserve.""   London-based financial analyst Louise Cooper shared her disapproval at Nadella's comments on Friday morning. In her regular analyst note she said that he had shown his ""true colors.""  ""I love it when CEOs make these gaffes because it gives us an indication of what they really think,"" she said. ""I suggest it was an ego trip.  He had hundreds of women listening to his words of wisdom and jostling for his attention.""   Cooper added that women have been waiting for ""the system"" to reward them since equal pay legislation was enacted decades ago and are still waiting. "

The site will take the place of the current Fendi store at 677 Fifth Avenue and is a significant announcement in Microsoft's five-year retail drive as it tries to strengthen its brand and win back market share from the likes of Apple and Samsung.

905,2014-09-25T06:54:08-0400,"  If you need to find Steve Ballmer at the end of next month, look for the former Microsoft CEO at the season opener between the Los Angeles Clippers and the Oklahoma City Thunder.  Hoping to put the Donald Sterling saga in the past, Ballmer will usher in a new era for the Clippers, after purchasing the team for $2 billion in August. The former software exec told CNBC that, despite paying a record price for an NBA team, he thinks it was a smart investment.   ""Can the Clippers make money?"" Ballmer asked. ""Yes. Can they make more money than any other team in the NBA? Yes, [we] should be in the upper echelon ... and particularly in Los Angeles, where this is a scarce property. This will appreciate. I expect to own this [team] as long as I'm alive. So we're talking, let's hope, 25, 30 years.""   A California court in August ruled that Shelly Sterling, wife of ousted Clippers owner Donald Sterling, had the authority to sell the team on behalf of the family trust. Sterling was stripped of his ownership by the NBA after making racist remarks that became public. He had owned the team since 1981, when he put down $12.5 million for the Clippers. Read MoreTony Stewart won't be charged in deadly crashBallmer was one of at least six serious bidders vying for ownership of the Clippers in what became a high-profile bidding war between everyone from Grant Hill to David Geffen.   Ballmer, who is worth $23 billion, according to Forbes, said the Clippers purchase came out of a desire to pursue a new, post-Microsoft chapter to his career. He said that Paul Allen, co-founder of Microsoft, told him how fun it was to own a professional sports team.   ""I liked football a lot too,"" Ballmer said, ""but basketball clearly is my first love.""  Ballmer said he will bring his well-known enthusiasm and emotion to his new role as the Clippers owner. He plans to let Doc Rivers continue to run basketball operations, preferring himself to stay on the sidelines running the business side of the team.       Previously, Ballmer tried to purchase the Sacramento Kings and relocate them to his hometown of Seattle. However, he said Clippers fans don't have to worry about him moving the team out of Los Angeles.   ""The clippers are the LA Clippers, and they will remain the LA Clippers,"" he said. ""There is no question about that. I live in Seattle. I will continue to live in Seattle. I'll be down here a lot for the games."" Read MoreHow sports can 'get back onside': Richard ParsonsRichard Parsons, who's winding down his stint as interim CEO of the Clippers, told CNBC on Thursday that Ballmer is going to be great for the team.  ""Ballmer is going to be a very good owner,"" the former Time Warner chief said in a ""Squawk Box"" interview. ""He brings tons of enthusiasm. And he's going to support the team ... [not] just put financial resources in, he's going to be a superfan.""  ""He cares about winning. He cares about the fans and they're going to feel the love,"" Parsons added.  Ballmer succeeded billionaire Bill Gates as Microsoft's CEO in 2000.   Under his leadership, the software giant's revenue tripled to $83 billion, but the stock fell 22 percent. Critics charge that Ballmer missed key technology trends such as social media, mobile technology and cloud services. It's a criticism that Ballmer disputes.   ""No one company will do everything,"" he said. ""Apple is a failure because they missed social? Nobody would say that, because they are having great success. We've had great success. Do I believe, with 20/20 hindsight, that we could have navigated mobile differently than we did? Yes, I do. Do I think the company's on the right path today? Yes, I do.""

Since Nadella became CEO on Feb. 4, Microsoft's stock is up nearly 30 percent, far outpacing both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq.    Ballmer said that Nadella's strategy of concentrating on mobile technology and cloud services is the right one, though he cautioned that it will be many years before investors can be certain.   ""The truth is that you can't really tell how anybody's doing in the tech business for at least five or 10 years,"" Ballmer said. "

911,2014-09-15T13:28:01-0400,"  ""Minecraft"" is the videogame world's equivalent of lightning in a bottle—an indie gaming sensation that grew organically, eventually becoming one of the industry's biggest franchises. It was a game that opened the doors for several other independent developers, who, in turn, brought a new burst of creativity to the industry.     So Monday's news that corporate behemoth Microsoft was buying Mojang, the developer of ""Minecraft,"" for $2.5 billion might seem an odd fit to some, but it could be a key strategic move for Microsoft.    Read MoreMicrosoft's $2.5B bet on 'Minecraft' a boost for mobile?   To understand the deal, it helps to understand the loyalty of the ""Minecraft"" audience.    Its players are among the most fervent in the gaming world. They not only play the game, they feast on other media related to it, which has given rise to some of YouTube's biggest celebrities.   Microsoft bought ""Minecraft"" as much for that community as it did for the game itself. ""Minecraft"" players skew young. While adults might play it from time to time, tweens (and younger) are its most ardent fans, wearing ""Minecraft"" clothes and carrying the stuffed animals.    By capturing that audience at an age when it hasn't yet formed its larger online habits, Microsoft can help assure its future—specifically, the one that CEO Satya Nadella has been leading the charge on for some time.    Nadella, since taking the top job, has been herding the company's Windows, mobile and Xbox gaming divisions toward a unified platform, and ""Minecraft"" could be key to that, letting those young players transport their games (and the worlds they have created within them) from platform to platform using a Microsoft account.  Older ""Minecraft"" players, meanwhile, aren't likely to rush out to buy a Windows Phone or an Xbox One just to play the game, but they're tastemakers, and their approval and use of the unified platform could encourage others to use it more.     That's not to discount the expansion possibilities of the game. Microsoft, which had greatly trimmed its in-house game development studios a few years ago, has slowly been re-entering that world.   Earlier this year, it acquired the rights to the ""Gears of War"" franchise, and in April, Phil Spencer, head of the Xbox unit, announced there were a ""couple"" of internal game studios that had not yet been revealed.   Read More'Halo' creators' 'Destiny' tops sales expectations   ""Gaming is critical to the consumer devices and platforms that Microsoft is on,"" he said at the E3 trade show in June.     Also, by purchasing the biggest Indie game around, Microsoft may also hope to quell some of the buzz that Sony's PlayStation 4 has been garnering in the gaming world for its indie-friendly approach.     And independent games could become more and more important as the current generation of game systems matures.     ""If Sony or Microsoft or Nintendo can come up with a game property that is rapidly iterated on, is always fresh and forces people to come back because they're so engaged, then that's going to be a defining characteristic of the back half of this generation,"" says John Taylor, managing partner of Arcadia Investment.   Read MoreMicrosoft targets budget consumers with new phones   ""Minecraft"" has been a phenomenon since its introduction. The game has been downloaded more than 100 million times on PC alone since its launch in 2009, and console sales have since topped those on PC.    On the Xbox 360, ""Minecraft"" has sold more than 12 million copies, just 2.5 million short of the total that ""Halo 3"" managed to sell (despite that game's five-year head start). Despite its age, ""Minecraft"" is regularly among the 10 top console sellers each month, according to The NPD Group.     Mobile is a potential growth area for the game, as well. ""Minecraft"" is one of the top grossing games in Apple's App store, but Mojang has refused, so far, to create a Windows Phone version, because of that product's low sales, a decision that will likely be reversed in the coming months.    Still, while Mojang and Microsoft have been partners for a long time, the relationship hasn't always been a smooth one.     Marcus ""Notch"" Persson, co-founder of Mojang, has repeatedly criticized the company. He has publicly pointed out the weaknesses of the Windows Phone division several times.    And, in 2012, he tweeted that he had ""rather have 'Minecraft' not run on Win 8 at all than play along. Maybe we can convince a few people not to switch to Win 8 that way....""    For Persson, though, the Microsoft deal lets him escape the high-profile industry role he never actively sought, he says.     ""I've become a symbol,"" he said on his website when the deal was announced. ""I don't want to be a symbol, responsible for something huge that I don't understand, that I don't want to work on, that keeps coming back to me. I'm not an entrepreneur. I'm not a CEO. I'm a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter,"" he said.     ""As soon as this deal is finalized, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing...small web experiments. If I ever accidentally make something that seems to gain traction, I'll probably abandon it immediately.... It's not about the money. It's about my sanity."" —By CNBC's Chris Morris."

More than 650 Salesforce employees signed a petition in June to Benioff over the software company's contracts with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency. Three months before that, Salesforce put out a press release announcing that the CPB is using Salesforce analytics and cloud products ""to modernize its recruiting process, from hire to retire, and manage border activities and digital engagement with citizens.""Protesters gathered at Salesforce's massive Dreamforce conference in September, claiming that the company was complicit in the government's immigration policy, including the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border.Google and Microsoft have also faced internal dissent regarding bids for a contract with the Pentagon, particularly in regard to how their artificial intelligence technology would be used to aid in warfare.Benioff has inserted in voice into other hot-button social and political debates of late.

914,2014-09-10T23:22:46-0400,"  Microsoft's potential purchase of Mojang, the Swedish company behind the popular block-building video game ""Minecraft,"" may not be a big deal financially, but it could be the winning ticket to expanding its mobile business, analysts said.   The U.S. tech giant is in discussions to buy Mojang for an estimated $2 billion, The Wall Street Journalreported earlier this week, a deal analysts don't expect to impact Microsoft's profits given that it's roughly 2 percent of Microsoft's $86 billion cash hoard as of the end of June.   ""This is pocket change for Microsoft; they spend more than that in their quarterly dividend. It's a move that gets headlines but in terms of its impact on Microsoft's top-line or bottom-line, it's going to be minor,"" said Charles Sizemore, CIO at Sizemore Capital Management.

""It's a strong signal that Microsoft is pretty invested in mobile strategy and the Windows Phone. They want to be able to offer different games and strategies across different platforms even if they are not the platform.

He really downplayed videogames and here, he seems like he's doing an about face by making a high profile purchase,"" said Charles Sizemore, CIO at Sizemore Capital Management.Read MoreMicrosoft's Nadella to visit China amid probe  In March, Nadella presented his ""Mobile First, Cloud First"" strategy, focused on developing cloud-enabled software to be deployable on mobile devices.

The most compelling one lets you ask Alexa to read your newest emails to you. And, if you want, you can delete an email or reply to it by voice.There are a couple of things to note before we get started. First, it only supports email accounts from Google's Gmail, Microsoft's Outlook.com, Hotmail and Live.com. Also, because Alexa reads your messages out loud, you probably don't want to ask to hear your latest messages in a place where other folks might be able to listen.Finally, this feature is rolling out in the U.S. starting Monday, so it might not be immediately available for everyone.First, you need to connect your email account to Alexa.Download the latest Alexa app for iPhone or Android.Tap the menu button on the top-left of the screen.Choose ""Settings.""Select ""Email &amp; Calendar."" (If you only see an option for ""Calendar,"" check whether your app is updated.)Tap the ""+"" button to add an account.Select Google or Microsoft (Choose Microsoft for Outlook.com/Hotmail or Live.com)Log in with your username and password.Next, if you want, you can add an option for a signature that says ""Sent via Alexa."" You might want to do this, in case you respond by voice and the transcription isn't very clear. At least people will know you didn't type gibberish.Now you can ask Alexa to read your email. You can either say ""check my email"" or ""read my email,"" both work equally well.It will start by saying how many unread messages you have. Then it will begin going through them from the most recent first, starting with the sender and subject line. When I asked Alexa to check my email, for example, it said: ""For Todd, for the last 24 hours, you have 35 unread emails. From Philadelphia Museum of Art, free shipping on orders of $25.""Then it gave me three options: I could have Alexa read the full email, reply to it, archive it or delete it. I asked Alexa to delete the message. It worked, and I noticed the email was removed from my Gmail inbox on my computer. I also tested a reply and saw that it was sent in my Gmail outbox.I wasn't able to compose a completely new email from Alexa, however. When I tried to say ""Alexa, email Steve,"" for example, it only sent a voice message to my editor's Alexa app instead of an email to his Gmail account. I also wish there were other options like ""report spam.""Also, while it's neat, having Alexa read a bunch of emails is kind of tedious. It felt like going through a huge voicemail inbox, which I hate to do.But, it could be useful for quickly checking your email while getting ready in the morning, or eventually for listening and responding to emails while you drive with Amazon's upcoming Echo Auto, which should be launching in the coming months.And finally, I asked Amazon if this means it's now able to read your email. Here's what a spokesperson told me:In order for email to work on Alexa, you must first link your email account in the Alexa app. By linking your account, some of your contacts and email messages are stored in the cloud to provide the service. This information is encrypted and stored securely in Amazon's servers. Amazon does not read an individual's email, except in very specific cases such as if that individuals asks us to do so or when we need to for security or compliance purposes, such as investigating a bug or abuse."

Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Mary Snapp already met with SAIC officials in Beijing earlier this month to discuss the antitrust matter.  Despite the rampant Windows piracy, China's SAIC initiated an antitrust probe into Microsoft earlier this month, saying that the company may have broken anti-monopoly laws regarding compatibility, bundling and document authentication for its Windows operating system and Office suite of applications.  On Tuesday, SAIC head Zhang Mao said at a briefing in Beijing his organization—one of three antitrust regulators in China—was focusing on Microsoft's web browser and media player, and suspected the company had not been fully transparent with information about its Windows and Office sales.The investigation has been met with puzzlement outside China, given that Microsoft settled U.S. and European antitrust cases around Windows more than a decade ago, and its desktop software monopoly is now largely irrelevant with the explosion of tablets and phones runningApple or Google software.

Microsoft settled in 2001 with the U.S. Department of Justice a long-running case centring around whether it could bundle its flagship Internet Explorer browser with Windows.   In 2004, the European Union ordered Microsoft to pay a 497 million euro ($656 million) fine and produce a version of Windows without the Windows Media Player bundled. The fine was later increased to nearly 1.4 billion euros.   China's focus on two products previously litigated elsewhere appears to form the basis of its investigation, but the probe could extend beyond the media player and browser bundling issue, said You Youting, a partner at Shanghai Debund Law Offices.

The Nokia 130 – released by Microsoft which bought the Finnish company's devices and services division earlier this year – is aimed at first-time mobile users and contains features such as a music and video player and flashlight.   Microsoft expects to begin shipping the so-called ""feature phone"" device in the third quarter of this year and will only be available in select markets such as India, China, and Nigeria.  ""It is estimated that at least 1 billion people in the world still do not have a mobile phone, while at the same time there is increasing demand for reliable backup phones in both mature and high-growth markets,"" Jo Harlow, corporate vice president for phones at Microsoft, said in a press release.

Read MoreMicrosoft and Nokia are both dumb about smartphones   The battery can last up to 36 days on standby and has Bluetooth capabilities, but no internet function.   Low-end smartphone shipments are expected to hit 1.1 billion in 2018, growing at an annual rate of 19.1 percent, according to IHS, and Microsoft's latest ""feature phone"" offering is likely to be successful in the absence of cheap smartphone competition, analysts said.   ""What it is really doing is bringing music playback and video to a price point it has never been before to ensure it stays ahead and to make sure there is no feature gap between this phone and its other low cost offerings,"" Daniel Gleeson, mobile analyst at IHS, said in a phone interview.

923,2014-08-08T15:49:35-0400,"  A former Microsoft employee was sentenced to two years in prison on Friday for his part in an insider trading scheme that netted him and his partner more than $400,000.   Brian Jorgenson, 32, had pleaded guilty to securities fraud for his part in a sophisticated operation in which he passed private information he gleaned from his job as a corporate finance manager at Microsoft to a former colleague who traded stocks and options.   ""It is important that you serve as a public example,'' U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman said in handing down the sentence in Seattle, Washington, federal court. Read MoreIt's time to legalize insider trading   Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 2-1/2 years for Jorgenson, who they say was the instigator of the scheme. Jorgenson, a father of four with no history of crime, had asked for one year and a day imprisonment, plus 500 hours of community service.   Jorgenson's day-trader accomplice Sean Stokke, 29, was sentenced to 1-1/2 years in prison two weeks ago. The maximum penalty for insider trading is 20 years.   The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission jointly charged the two men in December with operating an insider trading scheme. Jorgenson was fired by Microsoft soon after the scheme came to light.   According to charging documents, the pair's cooperation began in April 2012 when Jorgenson found out through his job in Microsoft's treasury department that the software company was planning a multi-million-dollar investment in the digital business of bookseller Barnes &amp; Noble.   He passed that information to Stokke, who bought options betting that Barnes &amp; Noble's stock would rise. The stock jumped about 50 percent when the investment was announced in late April 2012, reaping Stokke a profit of more than $184,000, prosecutors said.   Stokke, who had previously worked with Jorgenson at an asset management company, shared the profits with his partner via envelopes stuffed with $10,000 in cash, according to the charges, which resulted from probes by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Read MoreInsider activity and concentration by industry   The pair repeated a similar process twice in the following 18 months, prosecutors said, buying options on Microsoft stock or an exchange-traded fund prior to the release of earnings that Jorgenson knew would surprise Wall Street and cause sharp moves in the stock.   The two men took in a total profit of $414,000 from the combined trades and planned to start their own hedge fund, according to prosecutors.  —By Reuters "

926,2014-07-28T12:01:34-0400," Microsoft confirmed on Monday that Chinese government officials have visited their offices in cities across China.  Local Chinese media reported that officers from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce visited the U.S. software giant in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. A Microsoft spokesperson issued a statement, saying the company is happy to answer the government's questions. A reason for the inspections was not immediately clear, though the move coincides with the lifting of a ban on foreign game consoles that has lasted more than a decade.    The visits come as American tech companies have seen their businesses under pressure after the U.S. accused Chinese military officers of cybertheft. A source of speculation is that the company is under scrutiny for antitrust or pricing issues, since the authorities reportedly visiting Microsoft's facilities were from the industry and commerce division of the government.    As China's regulators look into the software giant's operations, Microsoft is attempting to pry its way into the country's fledgling foreign console market. The Xbox One became the first to hit the Chinese market following a 13-year ban, and e-commerce giant JD.com began accepting pre-orders for the device on Monday.    The Chinese government originally banned foreign consoles in 2000, citing concerns that violent games could have a detrimental effect on the mental health of young people. In January, however, the ban was lifted to allow consoles to be sold in the new Shanghai free-trade zone.   Consumers will be able to place orders for the console through  Tencent's WeChat, known as Weixin in China, and QQ messaging service. Tencent holds a 15 percent stake in JD.com.   JD.com did not disclose the price of the console, but said consumers would be able to reserve the new Xbox with a 499 yuan ($81) deposit. Gamers will also be able to buy the console through China Telecom later this year.   ""Launching Xbox One sales in China through JD.com's Weixin and Mobile QQ entry points underscores the strength of these platforms with young and sophisticated Chinese consumers,"" Shuang Du, vice President of JD.com in charge of the IT and digital business unit, said in a press release.   China has had a thriving video game ""grey market"" in which consoles such as Sony's PlayStation range and Microsoft's Xbox series were sold illegally. Gamers in the world's second largest economy have been brought up on a diet of PC games which makes up two thirds of the revenues generated in the country's gaming market.   This legacy in China's $12.3 billion dollar gaming market, might see Xbox struggle to make its mark on the scene, analysts said.   ""I think first mover advantage gives Xbox some worthy benefit but I don't expect the launch and the early months of the console to see significant sales,"" Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games at IHS, told CNBC in a phone interview.   ""The backdrop of the market is that it's dominated by PC gamers and mobile gamers,"" Rolls-Harding said. ""Entering that market where you've got a burgeoning mobile and tablet game opportunities and entrenched PC game usage is unlike any market that consoles would have entered into before.""   On top of the difficulty of changing the mindset of Chinese consumers, game makers are likely to face stiff regulation of content as well as the possibility that users might not connect with storylines or characters.   ""The games on Xbox are very catered towards western interest,"" Heloise Thomson, gaming analyst at Enders Analysis, told CNBC in a phone interview.   ""The characters, the enemies, the clichés are very different to what Chinese consumers will be used to.""

At least, that's been my experience.  I sincerely hope, however, that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella does not fall into this category, because one of his vice-presidents clearly needs some feedback on leadership skills.  In case you missed it, Stephen Elop, the executive VP of Microsoft's Devices &amp; Services business unit, recently buried the announcement of a 12,000-person layoff in an embarrassingly jargon-filled memo which began with a cheery ""Hello there.""  Read MoreMicrosoft shares climb after news of job cuts  In a previous role as director of human resources, I often had to help executives convey unwelcome news.  Some were naturally good communicators, others were teachable, and a few were  ... well, as clueless as Stephen Elop.  But since bad examples are frequently instructive, let's see what we can learn from him.  Using Mr. Elop's memo as a model, here's how to write a crappy, insensitive announcement to people who are looking to you for leadership:  1. Play hide-and-seek with the bad news. The Microsoft memo is over 1,100 words long (for comparison, this article is about 680 words).  But not until you have read 75 percent of the text (starting at word 843) do you discover the main point: ""an estimated reduction of 12,500 employees over the next year.""    Did Mr. Elop really believe that if he saved this disturbing news for the end, no one would notice?  2. Pile on so much jargon that no one knows what you're saying. There is normal language, then there is executive-speak. For example: "" Whereas the hardware business of phones within Nokia was an end unto itself, within Microsoft all our devices are intended to embody the finest of Microsoft's digital work and digital life experiences, while accruing value to Microsoft's overall strategy.""  Read MoreMost shorted stocks ahead of earnings  Say what?  Effective leaders remember how to talk like regular folks.    3. When you run out of jargon, just make stuff up. A few Elopian examples — ""our role is to light up this strategy,"" ""must be accomplished within an appropriate financial envelope,"" ""we will be the confluence of the best of Microsoft's applications.""  If you want to be creative, write a novel. But when communicating with employees, you need to be clear.     4. Minimize the human impact because it's such a downer. After announcing the anticipated termination of 12,500 employees, Mr. Elop states, ""These decisions are difficult for the team.""  Really?  That's how you sum up the pain and suffering of thousands of people losing their jobs?   In fact, we can't even be sure that this sentence refers to those who are being laid off. He might actually be alluding to the ""team"" which made these decisions — but let's hope not, because that would be really sick.   5. Ignore professional advice. Given that Microsoft is a huge corporation populated by professionals of every stripe, the odds are good that Mr. Elop began this effort with a draft created by someone experienced in employee communications. The remnants of this draft are still evident in a few clear, concise sentences.    For example, ""It is particularly important to recognize that the role of phones within Microsoft is different than it was within Nokia."" That actually makes sense.  But considering the final product, it appears that Mr. Elop unfortunately chose to take matters into his own hands.    Read MoreWaaaah!

Stephen Elop's email to employees  July 17, 2014   Hello there,   Microsoft's strategy is focused on productivity and our desire to help people ""do more."" As the Microsoft Devices Group, our role is to light up this strategy for people. We are the team creating the hardware that showcases the finest of Microsoft's digital work and digital life experiences, and we will be the confluence of the best of Microsoft's applications, operating systems and cloud services.   To align with Microsoft's strategy, we plan to focus our efforts. Given the wide range of device experiences, we must concentrate on the areas where we can add the most value. The roots of this company and our future are in productivity and helping people get things done. Our fundamental focus – for phones, Surface, for meetings with devices like PPI, Xbox hardware and new areas of innovation -- is to build on that strength. While our direction in the majority of our teams is largely unchanging, we have had an opportunity to plan carefully about the alignment of phones within Microsoft as the transferring Nokia team continues with its integration process.   It is particularly important to recognize that the role of phones within Microsoft is different than it was within Nokia. Whereas the hardware business of phones within Nokia was an end unto itself, within Microsoft all our devices are intended to embody the finest of Microsoft's digital work and digital life experiences, while accruing value to Microsoft's overall strategy. Our device strategy must reflect Microsoft's strategy and must be accomplished within an appropriate financial envelope. Therefore, we plan to make some changes.   We will be particularly focused on making the market for Windows Phone. In the near term, we plan to drive Windows Phone volume by targeting the more affordable smartphone segments, which are the fastest growing segments of the market, with Lumia. In addition to the portfolio already planned, we plan to deliver additional lower-cost Lumia devices by shifting select future Nokia X designs and products to Windows Phone devices. We expect to make this shift immediately while continuing to sell and support existing Nokia X products.   To win in the higher price segments, we will focus on delivering great breakthrough products in alignment with major milestones ahead from both the Windows team and the Applications and Services Group. We will ensure that the very best experiences and scenarios from across the company will be showcased on our products. We plan to take advantage of innovation from the Windows team, like Universal Windows Apps, to continue to enrich the Windows application ecosystem. And in the very lowest price ranges, we plan to run our first phones business for maximum efficiency with a smaller team.   We expect these changes to have an impact to our team structure. With our focus, we plan to consolidate the former Smart Devices and Mobile Phones business units into one phone business unit that is responsible for all of our phone efforts. Under the plan, the phone business unit will be led by Jo Harlow with key members from both the Smart Devices and Mobile Phones teams in the management team. This team will be responsible for the success of our Lumia products, the transition of select future Nokia X products to Lumia and for the ongoing operation of the first phone business.   As part of the effort, we plan to select the appropriate business model approach for our sales markets while continuing to offer our products in all markets with a strong focus on maintaining business continuity. We will determine each market approach based on local market dynamics, our ability to profitably deliver local variants, current Lumia momentum and the strategic importance of the market to Microsoft. This will all be balanced with our overall capability to invest.   Our phone engineering efforts are expected to be concentrated in Salo, Finland (for future, high-end Lumia products) and Tampere, Finland (for more affordable devices). We plan to develop the supporting technologies in both locations. We plan to ramp down engineering work in Oulu. While we plan to reduce the engineering in Beijing and San Diego, both sites will continue to have supporting roles, including affordable devices in Beijing and supporting specific US requirements in San Diego. Espoo and Lund are planned to continue to be focused on application software development.   We plan to right-size our manufacturing operations to align to the new strategy and take advantage of integration opportunities. We expect to focus phone production mainly in Hanoi, with some production to continue in Beijing and Dongguan. We plan to shift other Microsoft manufacturing and repair operations to Manaus and Reynosa respectively, and start a phased exit from Komaron, Hungary.   In short, we will focus on driving Lumia volume in the areas where we are already successful today in order to make the market for Windows Phone. With more speed, we will build on our success in the affordable smartphone space with new products offering more differentiation. We'll focus on acquiring new customers in the markets where Microsoft's services and products are most concentrated. And, we'll continue building momentum around applications.   We plan that this would result in an estimated reduction of 12,500 factory direct and professional employees over the next year. These decisions are difficult for the team, and we plan to support departing team members with severance benefits.   More broadly across the Devices team, we will continue our efforts to bring iconic tablets to market in ways that complement our OEM partners, power the next generation of meetings &amp; collaboration devices and thoughtfully expand Windows with new interaction models. With a set of changes already implemented earlier this year in these teams, this means there will be limited change for the Surface, Xbox hardware, PPI/meetings or next generation teams.   We recognize these planned changes are broad and have very difficult implications for many of our team members. We will work to provide as much clarity and information as possible. Today and over the coming weeks leaders across the organization will hold town halls, host information sharing sessions and provide more details on the intranet.   The team transferring from Nokia and the teams that have been part of Microsoft have each experienced a number of remarkable changes these last few years. We operate in a competitive industry that moves rapidly, and change is necessary. As difficult as some of our changes are today, this direction deliberately aligns our work with the cross company efforts that Satya has described in his recent emails. Collectively, the clarity, focus and alignment across the company, and the opportunity to deliver the results of that work into the hands of people, will allow us to increase our success in the future.

932,2014-07-17T09:59:18-0400," Microsoft is cutting up to 18,000 jobs in the next year, CEO Satya Nadella said Thursday in a letter to employees. The cuts represent more than 14 percent of Microsoft's 127,000-person workforce. Wall Street welcomes Microsoft layoffs  ""That's clearly much higher than we were expecting. We, like most people, were thinking like 5,000 to 6,000,"" Kirk Materne, technology analyst at Evercore Partners, told CNBC right after the announcement.   As a result of the dismissals, Microsoft said, it will incur pretax charges of up to $1.6 billion for severance and related costs over the next four quarters.   ""We are moving now to start reducing the first 13,000 positions, and the vast majority of employees whose jobs will be eliminated will be notified over the next six months,"" Nadella wrote. ""It's important to note that while we are eliminating roles in some areas, we are adding roles in certain other strategic areas.""   Nadella explained the cuts, saying they ""simplify the way we work to drive greater accountability, become more agile and move faster."" Microsoft will also have fewer layers of management, he said.   About 12,500 of the cuts will result from the company's ""synergies and strategic alignment"" with Nokia Devices and Services, Nadella said. Microsoft announced that it would acquired Nokia in September 2013. ""This is a significant cut that Satya Nadella is trying to put his own stamp on the company. It also tells you that he's not going to let Nokia become a quagmire,"" Evercore's Materne said on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""

But the unit has struggled to deliver on its promise.  Sources paint a picture of a disorganized studio that struggled to close deals and lacked a fully fleshed-out business model. This inability to execute has turned off potential studio partners, they say, complicating the process of securing premium content.   The studio became a casualty of shifting corporate priorities that came with Microsoft's executive shuffle. Tellem had been hired by CEO Steve Ballmer, who less than a year later announced he would leave the company. Don Mattrick, who oversaw the Xbox division, similarly departed.

Here is the memo:   I hope you have had a chance to read today's mails from Satya. I wanted to take a moment to share a few thoughts on what this means for our team and some of the changes we are making as a result.   In last week's mail outlining some of the steps towards creating the culture and organization to bring our ambitions to life, Satya called out the strategic importance of Xbox as a strong consumer brand, a creative center for gaming and a leader in bold innovation. Every member of Team Xbox should be incredibly proud of the impact and reach your work has within the walls of Microsoft, with our developer community and most importantly, with consumers.   Microsoft is the productivity and platform company for a mobile-first and cloud-first world, and games are the single biggest digital life category in a mobile-first world.  Success in this category, by growing a robust Xbox business, brings additional value to Microsoft. I have stated this before, but for Xbox to be successful, we must remain committed to being a consumer-driven organization with the mission of meeting the high expectations of a passionate fan base, to create the best games and to drive technical innovation.   As part of the planned reduction to our overall workforce announced today and in light of our organization's mission, we plan to streamline a handful of portfolio and engineering development efforts across Xbox. One such plan is that, in the coming months, we expect to close Xbox Entertainment Studios. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the accomplishments from the entire team in XES. They have built an impressive slate of original programming and pioneered interactive entertainment on Xbox, such as the innovative reality series 'Every Street United' that succeeded in uniting audiences around the globe during the recent World Cup. I am pleased that Nancy, Jordan and members of the XES team remain committed to new, original programming already in production like the upcoming documentary series 'Signal to Noise' whose first installment takes on the rise and fall of gaming icon Atari and of course, the upcoming game franchise series 'Halo: Nightfall,' and the 'Halo' Television series which will continue as planned with 343 Industries.  Xbox will continue to support and deliver interactive sports content like 'NFL on Xbox,' and we will continue to enhance our entertainment offering on console by innovating the TV experience through the monthly console updates. Additionally, our app partnerships with world-class content providers bringing entertainment, sports and TV content to Xbox customers around the world are not impacted by this organizational change in any way and remain an important component of our Xbox strategy.   Change is never easy, but I believe the changes announced today help us better align with our long-term goals. We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us to define what the next generation of gaming looks like for the growing Xbox community. I have a great deal of confidence in this team and know that with clarity of focus on our mission and our customers we can accomplish great things together. We already have.   Thank you again for all you do for Xbox.   Phil   —By Dawn Chmielewski, Re/code.net.

The three have tossed around the title over the past few trading days, each closing with a market cap over $860 billion. Microsoft surpassed Apple in market cap on Friday, only for Apple to overtake it again on Monday. Amazon briefly eclipsed both companies during intraday trading Monday. As of Monday's close, Apple took the lead with a market cap of $877 billion. Amazon followed at $866 billion, then Microsoft with $860 billion.The horse race between these tech giants has intensified as the tech sector has seen an upswing from October declines and following the White House's announcement of a 90-day trade truce with China on Saturday. The stocks have been closely watched since August, when Apple became the first publicly traded company in the U.S. to reach $1 trillion in market cap. About a month later, Amazon reached the same milestone before markets closed, ending the day just below the $1 trillion mark.Microsoft's lead on Friday marked a significant shift in the tech sector, as the company hasn't closed a year in the top seat since 2002 and has not been the most valuable tech stock since 2010. While Apple and Amazon had been the two front-runners by market cap size, recent setbacks at the companies have given Microsoft a leg up. The company has seen its value more than triple since Satya Nadella took over as CEO from Steve Ballmer in February 2014, as Nadella has accelerated the company's transition into cloud-based services and allowed other parts of the business to take priority over the Windows PC operating system.Since Apple announced on its fourth-quarter 2018 earnings call that moving forward it would no longer disclose iPhone unit sales, investors have worried the company is getting ready for a significant drop-off in sales of its flagship product.Amazon saw a similar sell-off after delivering weak guidance in its third-quarter 2018 earnings report. The company expected $2.1 billion to $3.6 billion in fourth-quarter operating income, well below Street estimates of $3.9 billion for the quarter that spans the holiday season.Both companies have rebounded with the market and the pause in trade tensions with China.

Both the state-of-the-art buildings and lifestyle are fascinating to outsiders.""Silicon Valley is the birthplace of these things. A lot of visitors from around the world want to feel closer to that and experience it firsthand,"" said James March of Silicon Valley Innovation Center, which organizes tours, education programs and conferences about technology.The billion-dollar headquarters of some iconic U.S. tech companies have become so over the top that tourists from around the world are flocking to see them and maybe catch sight of a self-driving vehicle.When Amazon offered to invest $5 billion in the construction of its second headquarters, finalist cities proposed some fantastical designs, including public plazas, mixed-use spaces, dedicated traffic lanes for autonomous vehicles and even a bullet train in Dallas. Last month it confirmed its plans to split its new headquarters, dubbed HQ2, between New York City and Northern Virginia.Microsoft recently unveiled plans to overhaul its 500-acre campus in Redmond, Washington. Here is a look at some of the most popular tech headquarters that are attracting visitors.More of a campus than an office building, Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, is spread out over 12 acres. To get from one part of the campus to another, Google offers its employees free colorful ""G Bikes."" There are also organic gardens, tennis courts, sports fields and beach volleyball courts.The main building, Googleplex, is fronted by a T-Rex skeleton with twirling flamingos, a reminder to Googlers, as they are called, to stay relevant and not become dinosaurs. Inside, employees have access to fitness classes, massages, a 24/7 gym, on-site doctor, dry-cleaning facilities, plus cafeterias and micro kitchens, some with outdoor seating and the signature umbrellas in primary colors.While visitors can visit the grounds, they are not permitted inside the buildings unless they are escorted by a Google employee. The company doesn't run tours. Google also has a visitors center at 1981 Landings Drive in Mountain View, but it's not accessible to the public without a Google escort. Next to the visitors center is one of the most popular spots: a sculpture garden featuring various Android statues, one for each version of Android. The versions are all named after sweets, so there's a cupcake, donut, ice-cream sandwich, KitKat, gingerbread and honeycomb.Though the Google campus is pretty cool already, things are about to be upgraded. The company is working on two new buildings that will be built from the ground up: Charleston East, which would be located near the current campus in Mountain View on an 18-acre lot that's been leased by Google for years. The new building would have 595,00 square feet of office space, plus more than 10,000 square feet of publicly accessible areas, such as retail space, cafes or other amenities located in the middle of the building. The roof of the building would be designed to be lightweight with specially designed solar panels that would be lighter in color and safe for birds, covering the entire roof.The other building, Bay View, is a 1.1-million-square-foot facility on a 42-acre site. The design would be similar to Charleston East only over three structures containing office and conference space. The buildings would have two floors of workspace centered around interior courtyards. Any exterior glass will have a pattern so birds won't fly into the clear glass, plus shade systems and lighting controls to minimize light pollution at night.More than 12,000 Apple employees moved onto the 175-acre Apple Park in Cupertino, California, starting in April of last year. The ring-shaped building, which resembles a spaceship, is 2.8 million square feet and clad entirely by panels of curved glass. The building, which was designed by famed architectural firm Foster + Partners, is surrounded by parklands that Apple created by taking down 5 million square feet of asphalt and concrete and replacing it with 9,000 drought-resistant native trees and grassy fields. There's an orchard, meadow and pond on the grounds. Employees who get tired of the 100,000-square-foot fitness center can also use 2 miles of walking and running paths on the campus.The dramatic-looking building is powered by renewable energy and, according to Apple, has one of the largest on-site solar energy installations in the world. There's also a 1,000-seat auditorium, named after founder Steve Jobs, which features a dramatic 20-foot-tall glass cylinder with a metallic carbon fiber roof at its entrance.Alas, all of this is closed to the public, but Apple did open a visitors center a few months after opening Apple Park. Though the visitors center is separate from the main building, Apple said it was designed with similar aesthetics, featuring stone walls and terrazzo floors. It also has a cantilevered carbon fiber roof that is supported by stone clad cores, giving it the illusion that it's floating. Visitors at the center can check out 3-D models of the actual campus, go to the roof terrace or at the cafe for a coffee, or hang out at the store, which of course is stocked with Apple products.At 1,070 feet tall, Salesforce Tower in San Francisco is the tallest office building west of Chicago. Opened in 2016, the $1.1 billion skyscraper rises 61 stories over the Transbay District downtown. It quickly has become a landmark not only because of its height but also because of the ever-changing light display at the top of the building. The top nine floors of the building have 11,000 LED lights on the exterior, which feature work by artist Jim Campbell.Inside, the 10-foot-tall windows maximize natural light. Employees sit at desks that can be adjusted for height and can choose from three different ergonomic chairs and have clear sight lines to the windows. Green and brownish carpeting throughout the floors are designed to resemble pebbled paths and grassy areas. There are flexible seating areas on every floor, located in places where the view is the best, to encourage impromptu meetings.Every employee floor has a meditation room with floor pillows and books about mindfulness. There are also parents' rooms on every third floor, which can be used for pumping. Notably, there's no dining hall, as Salesforce encourages its employees to go out and buy lunch, but there is a social lounge on every floor with big comfy seating. There are also social lounges featuring mural designs by artist Shinji Murakami and a large kitchen island stocked with snacks and drinks.Many lounges have views of the nearby Salesforce Transit Center and Park, which has a 5.4-acre rooftop with botanical gardens, a jogging path, open grass areas, children's playground, outdoor amphitheater and cafe and restaurant.Of course, with a building this size, the best view is a few blocks away. Starting sometime early next year, Salesforce is set to open the top floor of the building, the 61st floor, to the public during limited hours. On nights and weekends the ""Ohana Floor"" will be open to select nonprofit and foundations.For now, curious visitors can check out the Salesforce lobby, which is open to the public. Facing Fremont Street, the lobby is decorated with company mascots and a natural park scene. There's also currently a Ducati motorcycle ""experience,"" which lets visitors don a leather jacket and pose on a Ducati bike.Facebook moved into its new 430,000-square-foot Menlo Park, California, headquarters, designed by Frank Gehry, in 2015. LEED-certified, MPK 20, as it's called, has a 9-acre green roof with a half-mile loop that weaves among trees and antive plants, cafes, gathering spaces and work cabanas. Inside, the building has an open floor plan and features large murals and art installations from local artists. The new building is connected to the company's old headquarters, located on the other side of the highway, with a tunnel. Employees can walk, bicycle or take a tram from one side to the other.Most of the company's 2,800 employees sit in spacious bullpens lacking dividers or walls, designed to evoke the company's ethos of openess. The space also includes some cafes and micro kitchens so employees can grab a coffee or snack, as well as spaces with couches and whiteboards for casual meetings. Though it's only been a few years, Facebook is expanding again and last year unveiled plans to build a new campus, right next to its existing headquarters. The new ""Willow Campus"" will have 125,000 square feet of retail space, including a grocery store and pharmacy, plus 1,500 housing units, 15 percent of which will be offered at below-market prices. The first phase, including a grocery store, housing and offices, is expected to be completed in 2021.Microsoft just recently unveiled its plan to overhaul its 500-acre campus in Redmond, Washington — 16 miles east of Seattle. The renovation, which just started, will take five to seven years to complete. Old buildings will be taken down and new ones added.As part of the project, Microsoft will add 18 new buildings, ranging from 180,000 to 220,00 square feet, for a total of 131 buildings when completed.The buildings, which are being built or refurbished with new tech such as sensors and building automation systems for security and power generation, will be four to five stories in height with spacious atriums and courtyards. The company will also continue adding outdoor meeting spaces like treehouses amongst native Pacific Northwest Douglas firs. They'll also be clustered into five ""villages"" or ""team neighborhoods."" The plans include a 2-acre open plaza that can fit up to 12,000 people. In all, the multiyear project will add almost 3 million square feet of workspace and promote physical activity and alternative transportation.The campus will be built for pedestrians and bicycles, and there will be a foot- and cyclist- only bridge to connect both sides of the campus. The bridge will reduce the time it takes to get from one side of the huge campus to the other, from 22 minutes down to about 7 minutes after the renovation. It will also tie into the Redmond Technology Transit Station, which is scheduled to have a Link Light Rail in 2023. Cars will be hidden away in an underground parking facility. There are also running and walking trails, soccer and cricket facilities and retail space. Construction is scheduled to be completed in 2022."

Hundreds of tech shoppers showed up Thursday for the unveiling of a Microsoft store at the Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey. It didn't hurt that the opening featured a DJ, prizes, about $1 million-worth of product and software donations to local charities—and a concert by Macklemore and Ryan Lewis.

At a presentation in New York, new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella  made it clear that Microsoft, which recently acquired Nokia's handset business, is committed fully to making its own devices, despite a lack of success for its phones and tablets so far.       ""We are not building hardware for hardware's sake,'' said Nadella, at the event. ``We want to build experiences that bring together all the capabilities of our company.''  Watch: Can Microsoft tablet business turn around?       Microsoft, which is recasting itself as a 'devices and services' company, has not made much headway on the devices side, except for its Xbox game console.

951,2014-05-20T07:31:44-0400,"I's been quite a honeymoon for new Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. The executive, named to the top position in February, has continued the strategic shifts begun under predecessor Steve Ballmer.  But Nadella has also managed to put his own stamp on the company's messaging and tactics, and the reward has been a bump in the stock price. Now comes the hard part: managing Microsoft's substantial investments in hardware and mobile devices.  That continues on Tuesday in New York, when Nadella takes the stage for an 11 a.m. event that many tech observers believe will introduce new Surface and Surface Pro tablets.   But what kind of Surface tablets? A smaller ""mini"" tablet with a 7- or 8-inch screen, which has become a popular size in the tablet market?   ""The consensus on (Tuesday's) event seem to be centered on the announcement of a new Surface 'mini' running Windows RT, which seems a likely scenario to me,"" said Charles King, president and principal analyst at industry watcher Pund-IT. ""The fact is that the tablet market has evolved to support both mini (7-8 inch) and maxi (10-inch) sized products, to the point where even Apple, the longest major holdout, finally threw in the towel with the iPad mini.""   But an Intel-based mini-Surface running the latest version of Windows 8.1, ""seems a bit far-fetched to me,"" King added. ""The company may have felt that developing its own hardware was the only way Windows RT would have received proper attention, but the move reportedly irritated some of Microsoft's hardware partners to the point (that they are) throttling back or fully abandoning development of RT devices.""  Many of those same companies are finally seeing their smaller Windows 8.1 tablets gaining traction, ""so the appearance of a new mini Surface Pro would be unnecessarily provocative.""   Then again, why would the company want to go up against other inexpensive Windows tablets coming soon?   ""It is doubtful Microsoft will do a 7-inch or 8-inch product near-term,"" said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. ""A number of vendors plan to have Windows tablets in the second half of the year running on Intel and priced around $100, and I just don't think Microsoft wants to play at that price point.""   What Enderle is hearing is that Microsoft needs to separate the Surface and Surface Pro products, with the former being positioned more like a tablet and the Pro ""closer to a laptop in primary form to better match user needs. My expectation is that they are likely to make a strong move in that direction.""With Nadella, they have the opportunity to create a much richer, more differentiated line that is more strongly connected to cloud services and pulls from more of Microsoft,"" Enderle said.

Both changes represent a shift in strategy. Since it was announced in May of last year, the Xbox One was said to be designed for the Kinect, which can listen for voice commands, see which players are in the room, and even read your pulse. However, the required peripheral made Microsoft's new console a more expensive option than Sony's new PlayStation 4, which took an early lead in the latest generation of console sales and even beat the Xbox One at U.S. retail in March, the month of a major new exclusive.

That included separately paid-for subscriptions to services like Netflix, meaning using an Xbox as primarily a Netflix box was a financially less sound decision than buying a dedicated media box like a Roku or Apple TV that lacked the console's gaming options.

Read MoreMore iPhone 6 images emerge   Here's what to expect from the two events.  On Wednesday Samsung is expected to show off its Galaxy Note 4 smartphone, or phablet.    Last month the company sent out invitations to the event, which will be hosted simultaneously in Berlin, Beijing and New York. Samsung didn't reveal too much in the announcement, but hinted in that the company would be unveiling its Note device.    One of the key features of Samsung's Galaxy Note devices is its large screen size compared with those of competitors. The original Note device had a 5.3-inch screen; the Note 2 featured a 5.5-inch screen and the Note 3 was 5.7 inches. It's speculated that the Note 4 could be as big as 5.9 inches if it follows the same pattern, although it has also been reported that the phone will keep its predecessor's dimensions.

Apple, though, is expected to make a push to compete with larger smartphones by releasing two bigger iPhones next Tuesday at its company event. ""This is significant because it's the first time Samsung will be releasing a phablet at same time Apple is likely releasing a phablet as well,"" said J.P.

Samsung has already released a few teasers for the new device, where it hints that the stylus may also have some significant improvements. Some of the upgrades in the new device may not be that obvious, Gownder said. According to the Korean Times the phablet may also feature a more curved OLED screen, improved sensors and improved front-facing and back-facing cameras. And like Samsung's Galaxy S5, the new Note device may also feature a waterproof design.  ""Some of the rumors suggest that there are elements that need to be seen in person so it's hard to determine whether or not this will be a slam dunk yet,"" Gownder said. The company may also show off its virtual reality headset, which was developed with Facebook's Oculus as well as its new 3G-enabled Gear S smartwatch, which it announced late Wednesday, according to a PC Advisor report. Previous models of the smartwatch were not 3G enabled.   As for Microsoft, the company will be getting on the selfie bandwagon when it shows off what is expected to be its new smartphone at an event in Berlin on Thursday.   The device, rumored to be the Nokia Lumia 730, has been nicknamed the ""selfie phone"" because it's expected to feature a high-quality, self-facing camera. The phone is expected to have a 4.7-inch HD display and come in two models—one that supports 3G for emerging markets and one that has 4G LTE capabilities, according to multiple reports.

After the rocket plane topped 50-mile altitude, a crying Branson high-fived and hugged spectators.The carrier airplane hauled the SpaceShipTwo passenger rocket plane to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) and released it. Seconds later, SpaceShipTwo fired, catapulting it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for the pilots, Mark Stucky and Frederick Sturckow, to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Virgin's latest flight test comes four years after the original SpaceShipTwo crashed during a test flight that killed the co-pilot and seriously injured the pilot, dealing a major setback to Virgin Galactic, a U.S. offshoot of the London-based Virgin Group.""We've had our challenges, and to finally get to the point where we are at least within range of space altitude is a major deal for our team,"" George Whitesides, Virgin Galactic's chief executive, told reporters during a facilities tour on Wednesday in Mojave, where workers could be seen making pre-flight inspections of the rocket plane.While critics point to Branson's unfulfilled space promises over the past decade, the maverick businessman told a TV interviewer in October that Virgin's first commercial space trip with him onboard would happen ""in months and not years.""Thursday's test flight will have two pilots onboard, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger. More than 600 people have paid or put down deposits to fly aboard Virgin's suborbital missions, including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and pop star Justin Bieber. A 90-minute flight costs $250,000.Short sightseeing trips to space aboard Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket are likely to cost around $200,000 to $300,000, at least to start, Reuters reported in July. Tickets will be offered ahead of the first commercial launch, and test flights with Blue Origin employees are expected to begin in 2019.Other firms planning a variety of passenger spacecraft include Boeing Co, Elon Musk's SpaceX and late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Stratolaunch.In September, SpaceX said Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, founder and chief executive of online fashion retailer Zozo, would be the company's first passenger on a voyage around the moon on its forthcoming Big Falcon Rocket spaceship, tentatively scheduled for 2023.Musk, the billionaire CEO of electric carmaker Tesla , said the Big Falcon Rocket could conduct its first orbital flights in two to three years as part of his grand plan to shuttle passengers to the moon and eventually fly humans and cargo to Mars.According to Virgin, SpaceShipTwo is hauled to an altitude of about 45,000 feet (13.7 kms) by the WhiteKnightTwo carrier airplane and released. The spaceship then fires its rocket motor to catapult it to at least 50 miles (80.47 km) above Earth, high enough for passengers to experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the planet.Bezos' New Shepard has already flown to that altitude - an internationally recognized boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space known as the Karman line - though the Blue Origin trip did not carry humans.Virgin's Thursday launch likely will not go as high as the Karman line. Virgin's pilots are aiming to soar 50 miles into the sky - the U.S. military and NASA's definition of the edge of space and high enough to earn commercial astronaut wings by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.Thursday's test flight carried two pilots, four NASA research payloads, and a mannequin named Annie as a stand-in passenger.(Reporting by Eric M.

959,2014-04-28T09:49:14-0400," Microsoft is rushing to fix a bug in its widely used Internet Explorer web browser after a computer security firm disclosed the flaw over the weekend, saying hackers have already exploited it in attacks on some U.S. companies.   PCs running Windows XP will not receive any updates fixing that bug when they are released, however, because Microsoft stopped supporting the 13-year-old operating system earlier this month. Security firms estimate that between 15 and 25 percent of the world's PCs still run Windows XP.  Read MoreMajority of world's IE browsers vulnerable to attack   Microsoft disclosed on Saturday its plans to fix the bug in an advisory to its customers posted on its security website, which it said is present in Internet Explorer versions 6 to 11. Those versions dominate desktop browsing, accounting for 55 percent of the PC browser market, according to tech research firm NetMarketShare.   Cybersecurity software maker FireEye said that a sophisticated group of hackers have been exploiting the bug in a campaign dubbed ""Operation Clandestine Fox.""   FireEye, whose Mandiant division helps companies respond to cyber attacks, declined to name specific victims or identify the group of hackers, saying that an investigation into the matter is still active.   ""It's a campaign of targeted attacks seemingly against U.S.-based firms, currently tied to defense and financial sectors,"" FireEye spokesman Vitor De Souza said via email. ""It's unclear what the motives of this attack group are, at this point. It appears to be broad-spectrum intel gathering.""   He declined to elaborate, though he said one way to protect against them would be to switch to another browser.  Read MoreMicrosoft tackles Apple, Samsung with Nokia deal   Microsoft said in the advisory that the vulnerability could allow a hacker to take complete control of an affected system, then do things such as viewing changing, or deleting data, installing malicious programs, or creating accounts that would give hackers full user rights.   FireEye and Microsoft have not provided much information about the security flaw or the approach that hackers could use to figure out how to exploit it, said Aviv Raff, chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm Seculert.   Yet other groups of hackers are now racing to learn more about it so they can launch similar attacks before Microsoft prepares a security update, Raff said.

960,2014-04-28T09:00:20-0400,"  Microsoft's Xbox Entertainment Studios took the wrap off its plans for original programming Monday, announcing a lineup that stretches from soccer to Sarah Silverman. With everyone from Amazon to Netflix launching new premium content, Microsoft is hoping Xbox's distribution network, along with its interactive features, will give it a competitive advantage.   ""There are a lot of gamers who are used to actually interacting with the content itself, and what we're doing is creating high quality, premium content, and then hoping that we also can take advantage of the tech that we already have, with the over 200 engineers in Vancouver, Los Angeles, and Redmond, to create interactive features that offer a new TV experiences,"" said Nancy Tellem, Microsoft's president of entertainment and a former president of CBS Television Studios. Microsoft has 12 originals in the works and is leaning into its base—millennial males—who spend more hours streaming content than they do gaming on the Xbox. In June, the studio kicks off with ""Every Street United,"" a street soccer documentary series featuring international soccer star Thierry Henry and launching ahead of the World Cup in Brazil. Tellem hopes Xbox's massive distribution network—Xbox has 48 million subscribers worldwide—makes the world's biggest sporting event a likely score for the software giant's first foray into premium content.  Read MoreXbox original programming—no big risk for Microsoft   ""The most important thing is really creating this social community. So obviously with the use of Skype, you can actually, in your own living room, connect with people on the other side of the United States or the world for that matter, and be able to speak and exchange actually real-time conversations while you're watching the show,"" Tellem said.    Also in the works, a much talked about ""Halo"" live action TV series based on Microsoft's popular gaming franchise, produced by Steven Spielberg in partnership with 343 Industries and Amblin Television. The show goes into production in November. It's one example of how the company plans to leverage its substantial intellectual property developed for Xbox games into video.   In addition to originals, Microsoft is diving into live streaming, starting with the Bonnaroo music festival in June.    ""It essentially creates a virtual festival in your own living room,"" Tellem said. She noted that fans will be able to flip between different stages and camera angles, go backstage and follow individual artists, all while Skyping with friends to watch remotely together. ""The new audience likes the complexity—and the exciting thing is we have a platform that can allow us to tell more complex stories and the audience can dig in as much as they want to.""  Read MoreNike CEO setting record straight on FuelBand   It's content like this that may help Microsoft draw in a wider audience beyond gamers.    But Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter says Microsoft has a unique challenge in the media market. ""I don't think Microsoft is in a rivalry with Hulu or Netflix. It's more that Microsoft has a service that has a completely different value proposition—it wants Xbox Live members to feel good about subscribing,"" he said. ""They're not going to win Netflix customers and have them switch over to Xbox Live. But if 3 percent to 5 percent of Microsoft subscribers like any given show they produce, that makes the service stickier; and for some people that's a great deal.""   It remains to be seen whether it will be enough to launch a successful studio in the face of such formidable competition.   ""I will give them credit—they hired Nancy Tellem,"" Pachter said, noting that Tellem is ""a pretty capable TV executive"" whose hire is reminiscent of when Netflix hired Ted Sarandos.

962,2014-04-23T17:16:56-0400,"  The biggest news coming from Microsoft's earnings after the bell on Thursday won't necessarily be any number that's reported.   Instead investors are most looking forward to hearing what the software giant's CEO Satya Nadella will say on the earnings conference call. It will be the first earnings call since Nadella took the helm at Microsoft and it's also the first time the company's CEO has been on an earnings call in a very long time.   ""This is actually a huge deal. Steve Ballmer was never on the call during his entire reign,"" said Norman Young, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. ""It's almost like he is stepping up the accountability, it's an important tone to set for investors.""  Nadella's decision to join the call is overall a positive sign that the company is moving in the right direction, said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR.    ""Just him being on the call, just him speaking to Wall Street—as well as his employees—it's a huge step forward in terms of transparency,"" Ives said. ""It gives investors a better sense of what to expect.""   Microsoft's management has been working very hard to manage expectations and keep any surprises to a minimum while the company is going through this transition period so that the earnings stream becomes more predictable, said Kirk Materne, an analyst at Evercore.  Read MoreNSA, price wars could rain on Microsoft's cloud Analysts are largely expecting Microsoft to report a seasonally weak quarter. The company is expected to post earnings of 63 cents per share on revenue of $20.39 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters survey of analysts.    Investors will be listening on the call to see what Nadella says about Microsoft's key areas of business including its Windows franchise, its cloud business and the company's mobile strategy. But the CEO will be given a ""get out of jail free card"" when it comes to next quarter guidance because investors expect it to take some time for Nadella to fully implement his new strategies, Ives said.    ""We're not expecting any home runs from the quarter,"" Ives, who has a 'market perform' rating on the stock with a price target of $40, said. ""The biggest surprise would be if there was an uptick in the Windows franchise.""   The deteriorating PC market has weighed heavily on Microsoft's Windows business. But recent data from IDC shows that PC shipments are moderating, which means declining Windows sales may have finally hit a bottom.    ""There's starting to be some light at the end of the tunnel and the light doesn't seem like a train anymore (now),"" Ives said. ""The fundamentals are definitely more positive for Microsoft in terms of the direction they are going.""   As for Azure, Microsoft's cloud business, analysts expect to see continued strong growth despite competition from companies such as Google and Amazon. The company's cloud-computing unit has been experiencing triple digit growth year over year in recent quarters and investors will be looking for the same kind of growth when it reports Thursday.    Besides its cloud business, mobile is another key component of Nadella's strategy and investors are anxious to see what he has up his sleeve. Under Nadella, Microsoft already has rolled out its Office for iPad and made Windows free for some mobile devices, which show the company is taking a new approach to mobile.  Read MoreMicrosoft unveils Office for Apple's iPad   Still, there's the lingering question of just what the company plans to do with its acquisition of Nokia.    ""The elephant in the room continues to be Nokia. It's not Nadella's brainchild, but he's inheriting it,"" Ives said. ""It's like they are trying to turn the Cleveland Browns of mobile into a playoff team.""   Nokia is an acquisition the company had to make because at the time Nokia was making 90 percent Windows phones, Young said. But it is going to be a big anchor on profitability because it's a hardware business, he added.    With the Nokia deal expected to close Friday, it's unlikely Nadella will share too much on what the company's plans are with the smartphone maker, but Young said that going forward hardware probably won't be as much as a focus as it was under Ballmer.  Read MoreNokia opens a new chapter as it closes Microsoft deal   ""This was an acquisition that was made under the last CEO. Now they are becoming slightly more device agnostic,"" Young said.

963,2014-04-25T07:40:59-0400,"  Nokia completed the sale of its devices unit to Microsoft on Friday, but at a slightly higher price than expected, amid speculation over its next CEO.   The Finnish telecoms company said the transaction price for the acquisition of its Devices and Services business by Microsoft was 5.44 billion euros ($7.5 billion), up from the 5.4 billion euros its originally announced.   The deal closes another chapter in the long-running story for Nokia as it begins to focus on its network infrastructure business and technology after ditching its unprofitable handset business.  Nokia's manufacturing plants in Chennai, India, and Masan, Korea, will also not be transferred as part of the deal. The mobile company has been having difficulties in Asia, particularly in India where the factory is subject to an asset freeze as part of a tax dispute with the government. Nokia said the factory will remain under its control and it would produce hardware for Microsoft.

CEO speculation   Meanwhile media reports suggested Nokia will name Rajeev Suri as its new boss next week.    Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat, citing unnamed sources, said the move would be announced on Tuesday along with first quarter earnings.   A Nokia spokesperson declined to comment on reports of the new CEO when contacted by CNBC.  Suri is currently CEO of the Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN) arm of the organization which focuses on developing telecoms equipment. Analysts said his appointment as CEO would be a natural move as Nokia begins to focus on its network infrastructure business.   ""He has been one of the top candidates all the way along,"" Sami Sarkamies, senior analyst at Nordea Markets, told CNBC in a phone interview.  Read MoreNokia chairman admits mistake over $25 million Elop payoff   ""He is a great person for the job because he is responsible for the largest unit within Nokia. If you look at his tenure as CEO of NSN, we have seen great progress in the profitability of NSN and much has happened since the company initiated the initial restructuring program in late 2011.""   The NSN unit accounts for nearly half of Nokia's total revenue and will be the biggest arm within the company when the Devices and Services business is sold to Microsoft.    In 2011, NSN undertook an aggressive restructuring drive that saw around 17,000 jobs axed in an attempt to make the unit more profitable. Suri was the CEO of this business at the time and is largely credited with the success of the turnaround. In 2013, NSN posted operating profits of 1.1 billion euros, up 39 percent from the year before.   Nokia's CEO role has been vacant since former boss Stephen Elop stepped down from his post after the Microsoft deal was announced in September. Elop previously worked for Microsoft and is set to return to his former employer, taking the helm at the devices and services division.   Despite the credentials of Suri, Sarkamies said he would have to juggle the demands of all of Nokia's businesses carefully.   ""He may not necessarily be an ideal candidate because as a shareholder, you could be worried about how he will use his time. Will there be a danger of the ball being dropped on NSN if the CEO is going to spend more time on other businesses within the company?,"" Sarkamies said.

The new Nokia is more ""nimble"", according to Daniel Gleeson, mobile analyst at IHS, who said Nokia would expand its smaller units, creating new technologies under patents and selling the licenses.    ""The part of Nokia that will try to be more nimble is its Advanced Technologies Unit,"" Gleeson told CNBC in a TV interview.    ""At the moment that unit is mainly going to be based around licensing its existing patents. But I'd say you're going to see a lot of research into some new technologies, and hopefully even some new products will come out of Nokia in two or three years' time from that unit."" "

Nadella is set to face analysts' questions for the first time in public on a conference call later on Thursday.   ""This quarter is a nice step in the right direction for Nadella and Microsoft,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""We would characterize these results as solid in a choppy IT spending environment.""   Nadella's emphasis on cloud computing helped its server software business, while a softer-than-expected decline in PC sales limited damage to the bottom line.

965,2014-04-26T01:37:24-0400," Microsoft's 5.44 billion euro ($7.5 billion) acquisition of Nokia's devices business could give it the impetus to take a bigger slice of the smartphone pie, analysts told CNBC on Friday.   The U.S. technology giant closed the long-awaited deal with Finland's Nokia at the end of the week, in what is viewed as a challenge to Apple and Samsung's success in the smartphone market.  Read MoreNokia seals Microsoft deal amid new CEO speculation   Microsoft produces its own operating systems (OS) for smartphones, but compared to other players it is small in the market. The Windows smartphone OS had a 3.3 percent share of the total smartphone market, compared with Google Android's 78.6 percent and Apple's 15.2 percent in 2013, according to data from IDC.   In a statement released on Friday, Microsoft boss Satya Nadella said the latest move by the company would help with its ""transformation"". A Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC via email that the deal with Nokia was a ""milestone"", but integrating the new business would ""take some time to complete"".    Around 80 percent of the smartphones running a Windows operating system are already manufactured by Nokia, according to data provider IHS, making the telecommunications company an ideal partner for Microsoft. Control of Nokia's handset arm could help Microsoft bolster its smartphone offering. ""Quite clearly, it lets Microsoft have full control over not just the software, but of course now the hardware direction as well,"" Daniel Gleeson, mobile analyst at IHS, told CNBC in a phone interview. ""For Microsoft, it means they are able to bring that key partner under its wing, and really try to build something much bigger than it has been, and really try to make a big breakthrough and challenge the likes of Android and Apple's iOS system.""

Elop stepped down as Nokia boss when the acquisition by Microsoft was announced. He formerly worked at Microsoft before Nokia.   It is unclear what former Nokia products Microsoft will focus on, but ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer gave some hints last year. He told CNBC that the acquisition of Nokia would create ""interesting opportunities"" for PCs, as well as tablet devices.   Read MoreBallmer: Nokia deal opens possibilities for tablets   Buying Nokia's devices unit will help Microsoft offer a more unified product, Samuel Gee, senior technology analyst at Mintel, told CNBC.   ""For consumers, the most noticeable impact of the deal will be thanks to the vertical integration of handset manufacture into Microsoft's smartphone proposition,"" Gee said via email.   ""With a production line more like Apple's – where the OS and the hardware are created to specifically complement each other – the company will be hoping to gain an edge by producing devices that avoid problems arising from the sometimes haphazard pairing of a single proprietary OS – like Android – with phones from a number of manufacturers with a huge variety of capabilities.""

But industry-watchers believe that rather than closing the book on the company, the deal could give Nokia a new lease of life. Microsoft said in a statement on Monday that it had ""completed the steps necessary"" to seal the deal for Nokia's devices and services business on April 25. ""The completion of this acquisition follows several months of planning and will mark a key step on the journey towards integration,"" the technology giant said.The move will end a long-running saga for Finland's Nokia, which has seen its share of the mobile phone market eroded over the past few years by the likes of Apple and Samsung.

""If you look at the past few years it has been a rollercoaster ride for Nokia,"" Sami Sarkamies, senior analyst at Nordea Markets, told CNBC in a phone interview. ""We have seen huge disappointments in the handset business, but the new company will have a stable balance sheet and it will be holding profitable businesses.""

The three companies merged in 1967 as the communications revolution began to unfold.   Nokia void   Nokia's headquarters are in a Finnish city called Espoo, where it dominated the technology scene for several years. Recent job cuts and the shrinking of its business have been negative for the area, but other technology firms are filling the void.   Smartphone maker Jolla is one such company, with around 90 percent of its workforce made up of ex-Nokia employees. Angry Birds-maker Rovio is another key part of the Finnish technology landscape in Espoo, taking advantage of the area's technology expertise.Read MoreInside Europe's wannabe Silicon Valleys  Sam Gee, senior technology and media analyst at Mintel, said Nokia's difficulties could provide opportunities for its Finnish counterparts.    ""As with the demise of any massive company, there will always be opportunities in taking over market space.

Read MoreCan the Finnish fill the void left by Nokia?  Deal tweaks   The Nokia-Microsoft deal was approved by Chinese regulators earlier this month. It is now likely to go ahead without the transfer of a large factory in Chennai, India, which is part of a separate tax dispute.   Under tweaks to the agreement, Microsoft will not take control of Nokia's Korean manufacturing facility as originally planned. Microsoft will also take on 21 employees from Nokia's chief technology office in China.   In addition, the Nokia.com website domain name, as well as Nokia's social media sites, will be managed by Microsoft for up to a year after the deal.

More so it could be the new high for the year,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading, in Chatham, New Jersey.Wall Street is widely considered to be in a bull market that started on March 9, 2009, when investors grappled with the global financial crisis that had vaporized over half of the U.S. stock market's value. Since then, the index has more than quadrupled.Now after nine years and five months, investors are debating when, not if, the current run-up in stock prices will end.Bull and bear markets are identified only retroactively, and it is too soon to say for certain whether a correction in the S&amp;P 500 in February marked the end of the bull market and the start of a bear market.To be sure that the S&amp;P 500 is still in a bull market, it would have to close above its record high set on Jan 26, which it failed to do on Tuesday.

""(If) we drop 20 percent before we reach a new high, we will go back and declare that the current bull market ended on January 26, 2018, the last high.""Wednesday's record is also debatable because Wall Street experts define bull and bear markets differently.Some experts say a bull market occurred from 1990 to 2000, which would make the current one the longest ever. Others say that bull market started in 1987 and ran to 2000, which would be three years longer than the current bull market.Apple Inc is responsible for 4.1 percent of the S&amp;P 500's return since March 9, 2009, more than any other company.

969,2014-04-11T07:46:23-0400,"  Patent buyer Intellectual Ventures has persuaded Microsoft and Sony to invest in its latest acquisition fund while Apple and Intel, which invested with IV previously, declined to participate, according to people briefed on the fundraising.   The investment decisions by four iconic technology companies comes in the midst of a heated debate over whether it is too easy for patent owners to extract large royalty payments, and whether patent buying firms spur or stifle innovation. Read MoreWhy Apple's the underdog in this Samsung trial   Last year IV curtailed patent acquisitions as it sought new investors, and IV now is ramping up, say three sources familiar with IV's activity in the patent market.   ""Microsoft and Sony's investments give IV a fresh war chest to buy new patents,"" said Kevin Jakel, chief executive of Unified Patents, which advises tech companies on alternatives to patent aggregators like IV.   But Apple and Intel's decision is significant because the biggest tech companies have supported IV in the past. ""This would be a dramatic departure,"" Jakel said.   Intellectual Ventures declined to discuss investments. Microsoft, Sony, Intel and Apple also would not comment. It is unclear whether Intel and Apple could still opt to invest in IV's vehicle at a later time.   Created in 2000, Intellectual Ventures has raised about $6 billion and acquired 70,000 patents and other intellectual property assets. The company is seeking to raise $3 billion more, a 2013 investor presentation reviewed by Reuters shows. Read MoreApple to issue two new iPhones this fall: Report   Over the years IV and other firms like it have faced criticism from some in the technology industry, who argue that firms like IV, which do not primarily make products, exploit the patent system by demanding royalties and threatening litigation.   IV argues that by buying patents from inventors, it creates a mechanism for them to capitalize on their ideas. Several large tech companies previously invested in IV, which gave them low-cost licenses to IV's vast patent portfolios as well as a portion of royalties IV collected.   Microsoft, Sony, Apple and Intel all invested in IV's previous funds, court filings show. Prior to co-founding IV, Nathan Myhrvold was chief technology officer at Microsoft working closely with Bill Gates. Another IV co-founder, Peter Detkin, was previously an Intel in-house lawyer.   IV's fundraising comes as a proposal to make it easier to fight patent lawsuits passed the House of Representatives last year and is currently pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee.   Some companies like Google publicly supported the bill, which included a provision to make it easier for the winner of a patent lawsuit to recover legal fees. Google invested in IV's first fund in 2003 but has said it declined to participate in subsequent ventures. IV sued Google's Motorola Mobility unit in 2011, and that litigation is ongoing.   Microsoft and Apple, meanwhile, were among seven major corporations which warned last week that some of the bill's provisions could weaken the patent system and hurt innovative companies.   Amy Landers, an intellectual property professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law, said Apple and Intel's decision on IV's latest fund was probably unrelated to the political debate on patent reform. Read MorePatent trolls target US businesses   ""The companies that are not investing in the fund have probably just found better uses for their money,"" Landers said.   At the end of 2012 the average rate of return for IV's 2003 fund was 16.2 percent, while the 2008 fund stood at 2.5 percent, according to the 2013 investor presentation. In a court filing last year, Intellectual Ventures said it has earned more than $3 billion to date in licensing fees.   Patent buyers also are facing some competition from companies like Unified Patents, which argue that tech companies should try to invalidate threatening patents instead of just financing aggregators like IV to acquire them.   ""I think there's a recognition by a lot of companies that simply trying to buy your way out of the problem is like bailing water from a sinking ship,"" Jakel said.   Jakel declined to disclose whether any of the tech companies in this report are clients.   —By Reuters "

Microsoft also said on Wednesday it will give away its Windows operating system to makers of smartphones and small tablets as it seeks to grab a toehold in those fast-growing markets.Microsoft's move, announced at the conference in San Francisco, is an attempt to broaden the small user base of mobile versions of Windows, in the hope that more customers will end up using Microsoft's cloud-based services such as Skype and Office.Up to now, Microsoft has charged phone and tablet makers to use versions of its Windows system on devices, as it has done successfully for many years with Windows on personal computers.

975,2014-04-03T08:03:46-0400,"  Microsoft's big investment in cloud computing—a large part of its reinvention strategy—could be derailed by concerns about U.S. government snooping and an emerging price war among the big players.  Foreign cloud companies will win big from NSA spying revelations   ""Microsoft has spent tens of billions on cloud and it's a necessary move in order for them to be a relative player in next generation data center,"" said Daniel Ives, managing director and senior analyst of FBR Capital Markets. ""Cloud is the next big platform and it's the key to their success."" Microsoft's long-standing relationship with its enterprise customers and its Windows platform give it a leg up against such competitors as Amazon, Google and Oracle, Ives said.   ""The whole company and whole product approach is going to be around the cloud,"" Ives said.   But he added, ""one of the impediments of moving to cloud is security and data privacy."" Since Edward Snowden's NSA revelations, every CIO at every international company worries intensely about data snooping, and U.S.-based companies are coming under extra scrutiny, Ives said.   Microsoft's own general counsel, Brad Smith, said in December that in the wake of the NSA leaks, many of the company's customers expressed serious concerns about the government's access to their data. Smith even went as to say that government snooping could be considered an ""advanced persistent threat,"" along with malware and cyberattacks.  It's been estimated that the U.S. cloud industry could lose anywhere from $35 billion to $180 billion by 2016 because of lost business spurred by government spying. But Rajeev Chand, managing director and head of research at Rutberg &amp; Company, thinks these concerns are overblown.  ""On the data issue, we do not think this is a major effect. There is a lot of noise on this in this discussion, but we haven't seen a huge impact,"" Chand said. ""There has been a delay in decision-making with some non-U.S. companies and a few instances when customers have gone with non-U.S. providers."" Also, most big companies assume that other countries are hacking into their data as well, Chand said.  A potentially bigger issue is that Microsoft is pushing cloud services just as a price war appears to be brewing.   Amazon and Google have been aggressively slashing prices for their cloud services, and on Monday Microsoft was forced to do the same   ""It's going to be a brutal war from a pricing perspective. That's really their primary headwind,"" Chand said.    Microsoft responded: ""We do not have anything new to share beyond our commitment to match Amazon pricing for commodity services. While price is an important factor, Microsoft believes that overall innovation and quality will prove to be more important than commoditization.""   The company also says it is addressing the privacy issue by allowing clients the option of storing customers' information in data centers located outside the U.S. It has also implemented hybrid solutions, which allows customers to store part of their data in the cloud and more sensitive data on site. This offering has even given the company an edge against competitors, Ives said.    ""Letting customers decide where their data resides, this is out of the mold for tech companies and is kind of a battleground topic because most tech companies decide where data is stored,"" he said.   ""Microsoft needs to do everything in their power to facilitate companies moving to the cloud because their success is really going to center around their overall cloud strategy,"" he said.   —By CNBC's Cadie Thompson.

On Wednesday, it could claim the title of longest ever.Following its January high, the S&amp;P 500 slumped 10.2 percent over two weeks, just meeting many investors' definition of a market correction and raising fears that nearly a decade of gains on Wall Street might be over.Since then, Wall Street has splintered: Small caps have soared thanks to deep corporate tax cuts, while companies exposed to global trade have underperformed, with some investors worried about U.S. President Donald Trump's feud with China and other trading partners over import tariffs.After steep drops in February and March, the S&amp;P 500 inched slowly back toward record highs as sweeping tax cuts sent earnings sharply higher and provided cash for companies to buy back more of their shares and invest in new capital.Nearly 80 percent of S&amp;P 500 companies reported June-quarter earnings per share above Wall Street's estimates, compared with a 64 percent beat rate in a typical year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The S&amp;P 500 is outperforming other major indexes globally for the year since May, and has not looked back. It ended Tuesday up 0.21 percent at 2,862.96, helped by consumer discretionary companies.Fueled by Amazon, Microsoft Corp, Alphabet and other high-growth tech and consumer stocks, the Nasdaq has surged 14 percent in 2018, far outperforming the S&amp;P 500's 7 percent rise.""A lot of it is earnings,"" said Liz Young, senior investment strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management in New York. ""The technology stocks continue to drive things. We've waited for that theme to go away but it hasn't.""The Russell 2000 index of small companies hit its own record highs on Tuesday, while the S&amp;P 500 materials sector this year has lost 2 percent.The S&amp;P 500 has been trending higher since early 2009, providing a gain of over 300 percent for investors who stayed on for the entire ride.Some investors worry that the market is at risk of a sell-off if the few top-shelf stocks that have driven it higher in recent years lose steam.""One of the areas of concern is that theres still a relatively narrow breadth in the market in terms of leadership.

980,2014-03-27T13:16:01-0400," Microsoft's Office suite of applications, encompassing its popular Word, Excel and PowerPoint programs, will become available to iPad users from Apple Inc's app store from Thursday.   The announcement marks a significant break with Microsoft's longstanding Windows strategy now that new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella has taken the helm. The software giant has previously been unwilling to compromise its signature PC operating system.   At a news conference Thursday, Microsoft executives demonstrated a new ""touch-first"" version of Office crafted for the iPad, available for download as a free app this morning, although a subscription is needed to let users create or edit documents. Significantly, executives did not demo any software on Windows machines.   Thursday's Microsoft event is Nadella's first major public appearance since his appointment last month.  While the technology behind the software is not ground-breaking, the strategy is: It puts Office at the heart of the company's push to become a leading services company across a variety of platforms—possibly at the expense of Windows and its own Surface tablet.   That perceived willingness to break with the Windows tradition, which remains co-founder Bill Gates' most enduring legacy, helped spur Microsoft shares to $40-plus levels not seen since the dotcom boom of 2000.   Analysts have said the lack of an Office version for the iPad may have robbed Microsoft billions of dollars in revenue.    Read More Microsoft soars on Office-for-iPad report   ""We estimate that if 10 percent of the iPad install base were to subscribe to Office then this could add 15 million subscribers and generate $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion in consumer Office subscription revenue per year,"" Bernstein Research analyst Mark Moerdler said earlier this month in a research note.

The Finnish firm said on Monday that it expects to close the deal in April 2014, after previously stating that the sale of its devices and services business to Microsoft would be finished in the first quarter of this year. Analysts believe the group may need to offer further concessions.   Nokia has received regulatory approvals from the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice, the company said in a statement on Monday, but approvals from certain antitrust authorities in Asia are still pending.

Nokia said the claim was ""absurd"" in a statement on Friday.

986,2014-07-16T06:21:14-0400," U.S. online giant Yahoo  received more bad news on Tuesday on top of its worse-than expected second-quarter results with reports that the technology giant is about to be usurped by rival Microsoft.  Yahoo's share of the global $140.15 billion digital advertising market will fall from 2.86 percent to 2.52 percent during 2014, according to projections by independent market research company eMarketer. The same firm predict that Microsoft will grow its share to 2.54 percent of the market - just enough to surpass Yahoo for the first time.

Reuters reported on Monday that Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella would unveil the iPad app at an event on March 27 as part of the new CEO's ""mobile first cloud first"" strategy.   The event will be Nadella's first major public appearance since his appointment last month.   Microsoft shares rose as much as 5 percent to $39.90 on Tuesday, adding $15 billion to the company's market value.

The shares last touched $40 in July 2000.The stock ended nearly 4 percent higher on Tuesday. (Click here to track Microsoft shares in after-hours trade.)  Microsoft has had iPad and iPhone versions of Office primed for several months now, sources told Reuters, but the company has dallied on their release due to internal divisions, among other things.   Analysts said the lack of an Office version for the iPad may have robbed Microsoft billions of dollars in revenue.   ""We estimate that if 10 percent of the iPad install base were to subscribe to Office then this could add 15 million subscribers and generate $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion in consumer Office subscription revenue per year,"" Bernstein Research analyst Mark Moerdler said in a note on Tuesday.   (Read more: iPad for Office to be unveiled this month)   Investors have urged Microsoft for years to adapt Office, its most profitable product, for iPhones and iPads and devices using Google Android software—rather than shackling it to Windows as PC sales decline.   Microsoft's productivity tools remain the industry standard in offices, but America's employees are increasingly using smartphone and tablets to supplement their work.   Tired of waiting for Office to be optimized for their touchscreen devices, a growing contingent of younger companies are turning to cheaper touch-friendly apps that can perform word processing and other tasks in the cloud.   Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said the plan to launch the iPad app would signal that Microsoft is moving towards a more serious cross-platform strategy.   Moerdler said he did not believe that the app would have any significant positive or negative impact on Microsoft's Windows franchise as majority of corporate customers use Windows.   Microsoft already offers Office Online as a free Web-based version, and on its Windows smartphones.   Google has been making inroads into Microsoft's Office software business with its free Google Drive application, which includes spreadsheets and word-processing tools.

989,2014-03-11T11:36:54-0400,"  The world has been scrutinizing newly-appointed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's every move. Early indicators signal a welcome departure from his predecessor Steve Ballmer.    In Ballmer's 12-year tenure, Microsoft was profitable but outpaced by competitors. While Microsoft's market capitalization slid from $288.9 billion in 2002 to $226.8 billion in 2013,  Apple's shot from $6.8 billion to $456 billion during the same period. While Apple and Google launched disruptive technology like the Android, iPhone and iPad, Microsoft was often slow to capitalize on advancements in mobile music, smartphones, and tablets (though the success of Xbox and Kinect were surely victories). For example, despite fantastic reviews of the Windows Phone 8.1, it may be hitting the market to late — iPhone and Android have already gobbled up 97 percent of the worldwide smartphone market.  (Read more: Cramer: Hey, Nadella, here's why Microsoft needs a spinoff)Many are asking, Will Nadella be a better CEO than Ballmer?   Perhaps a better question is, Will Nadella drive the right strategy and culture for Microsoft to successfully re-invent itself? Though a CEO's leadership style is not the sole reason for a company's success or failure, research supports the strong relationship between great leadership and financial performance. Leaders set direction and drive culture that either supports or prevents strategy execution.On the strategy front, Nadella hinted he'll move away from traditional desktop software and towards a ""mobile first, cloud first"" approach. With mobile devices and applications like Office for iOS and Android, and cloud strategies like application-hosting service Azure and Office365, Microsoft is well-positioned.(Read more: Microsoft bets that 'Titanfall' will boost Xbox One sales)But for Nadella to succeed, he must also transform Microsoft's culture. The culture Ballmer created was characterized by highs and lows. His passion for the company he joined in 1980 was unparalleled. Nadella himself reported learning a great deal from him: to ""stay grounded, and to be brutally honest with yourself.""    But the very qualities that gave Ballmer his edge were also his downfall. His temper was the stuff of corporate legend. Microsoft insiders recount screaming matches with Ballmer, and according to software engineer Mark Lucovsky, Ballmer indeed threw a chair when he resigned to work for Google. In 2013, Ballmer's approval rating was a mere 47 percent compared to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg (99 percent), Google's Larry Page (95 percent) and Apple's Tim Cook (93 percent).Why was Ballmer's leadership style the wrong fit for a company needing to reinvent itself? It's likely that his intense competitiveness created a culture that undermined innovation. There are many examples, but perhaps most telling was the company's employee stack-ranking system, which ""encouraged people to backstab their co-workers."" (To Ballmer's credit, he did eliminate this system in November 2013). In contrast to Ballmer's ""larger than life"" approach, Nadella helped employees to see him as a human being first. In his first letter to employees, he shares the important role his family plays in his life and admits to buying more books than he can finish. (Read more: Icahn's eBay war: The Street vs. Silicon Valley)As a leader, Nadella is a walking contradiction; he possesses the rare ability to focus on people and results — without sacrificing one for the other. On the results side, he's a tenacious leader who seems determined to shift focus away from traditional software. He notes that ""our industry does not respect tradition — it only respects innovation."" And to truly innovate, rather than trying to be all things to all people, Microsoft must ""pick the unique contribution that we want to make.""On the people side, Nadella's collaborative style is a perfect fit. Many leadership thinkers argue that, to successfully innovate, leaders must foster a culture of cooperation rather than competition. Microsoft's products and services must integrate across platforms and devices. So instead of fostering competitive fiefdoms, Nadella must help employees partner and innovate across boundaries.Finally, whereas Ballmer was inclined to hog the spotlight, Nadella's humble nature will allow employees to take center stage. Nadella hails the value of empowering ""every individual,"" expressing confidence in employees' ""talent, resources and perseverance.""Because of his unique qualities as a leader, Satya Nadella is likely to accomplish what Ballmer could not: transforming Microsoft's culture, delivering an agenda of true innovation, and gaining a foothold against competitors. Indeed, he believes that Microsoft can truly ""improve other people's lives"" — it seems that he'll begin with his own employees.— By Tasha EurichTasha Eurich is an organizational psychologist, speaker and author of ""Bankable Leadership: Happy People, Bottom Line Results and the Power to Deliver Both.""

990,2014-03-11T14:13:20-0400," Sony may have gained an early lead in the battle of the next generation consoles, but Microsoft is launching its counteroffensive—and it's a big one.  ""Titanfall,"" a new game from the creators of the ""Call of Duty"" juggernaut, hits shelves on Tuesday. It's expected to be one of the biggest games of 2014. And it's exclusive to Microsoft systems.   In many ways, ""Titanfall"" is as important to the Xbox One as ""Halo"" was to the original gaming console. It's hoped to be a system seller—a new franchise that becomes a tentpole for players to rally around—and one that keeps Microsoft at the top of the console hill.    (Read more: Microsoft's Xbox One joins the game)  ""Titanfall"" is perhaps even more important to publisher Electronic Arts, which bet big on the developers when they left Activision in a 2010 dispute. EA shares have been rising in anticipation of the game's release, climbing 29 percent this year. Eric Handler of MKM Partners expects the game to sell 3 million copies before the end of the month.    Microsoft has bundled ""Titanfall"" with the Xbox One at retail, essentially offering a free copy to people who buy the console. Analysts say that likely subsidizes the cost itself. The potential short term losses that come with that bundle will be regained over time as the Xbox One matures and owners begin to purchase other games and buy subscriptions to Xbox Live and other services.    The bundle could also help close the sales gap between the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, which with a retail price $100 lower than Microsoft's console has so far proven to be the leader in this console generation.  Still, sales of the Xbox One have hardly been disappointing. Microsoft pointed out last month that the system has sold 2.29 times faster than the Xbox 360 did in the U.S. in its first three months on the market.  But Sony announced last week that life-to-date sales of the PS4 had topped 6 million units worldwide. The last hard sales number update Microsoft gave for the Xbox One came in early January, when it announced sales had topped 3 million in 2013.    (Read more: Why the PlayStation 4 is outselling the Xbox One)    And in January, PS4 sales were nearly double the Xbox One, according to BMO Capital Markets analyst Edward Williams. That came despite Sony's system being supply constrained as it prepared to launch in Japan.   That information, when viewed with the decision to bundle ""Titanfall"" with the Xbox One, could lead some investors to jump to the conclusion that Microsoft is worried about its position in the market. Analysts say, however, that these are the very early days of the current generation of consoles, making it highly unlikely Microsoft is worried about losing any significant ground.    ""I don't think Microsoft is losing any sleep five months after launch,"" said P.J. McNealy, of Digital World Research. ""This is a multiyear battle, not just between now and Easter. ... I think the 'Titanfall' bundle was planned regardless of whether Sony was at 3, 6 or 10 million [PS4 units sold].""   (Read more: Watching other people play video games…that's esports)   Beyond the impact for Microsoft and EA, ""Titanfall"" could have a positive ripple effect throughout the industry. Over 2 million players took part in the game's public beta test, which helped spread excitement about the game. As many of those gamers purchase the final retail edition, they might buy an additional game. And that could help the video game industry see year-over-year sales gains for the first time in several years by the end of 2014.   ""We expect the release of EA's 'Titanfall' in March to help revive sales for both current and next generation software, and think that a string of easy comparisons over the next six months will drive software sales into positive territory,"" said Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities.   —By Chris Morris, special to CNBC.com.

(Read more: Why the PlayStation 4 is outselling the Xbox One)  ""We're making a big bet that 'Titanfall' is going to be a blockbuster launch for Xbox,"" Yusuf Mehdi, head of marketing and strategy for Microsoft's Xbox group, said in an email interview.   As part of its ""Titanfall"" campaign, Microsoft will also promote the game at South by Southwest, the annual gathering of tech industry experts, filmmakers and musicians now under way in Austin, Texas. Developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts, the game will be made available for the older Xbox 360 consoles on March 25.   Microsoft is locked in a console battle with Japan's Sony, which announced last week it had sold 6 million PlayStation 4 units as of March 2. The device beat the Xbox One to become the top-selling console in the United States in January, according market research firm NPD Group.   (Read more: PS4 sales top 4 million, leaving Xbox One in the dust)  Both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 launched in November last year. Microsoft has not provided an update on sales since January, when it said Xbox One sales crossed three million units as of the end of 2013.   Priced $100 more than the $399 PlayStation 4, the Xbox One is seemingly trailing behind in sales. In February, Microsoft announced an Xbox One and ""Titanfall"" bundle for $499, effectively offering the game for free.   With the launch of ""Titanfall"" much anticipated, the games industry is watching to see if the title can replicate the ""Halo"" effect. Released exclusively for the Xbox back in 2001, ""Halo""—another sci-fi shooter game—became a blockbuster franchise, fueling sales of Xbox consoles.   ""We don't have a sales forecast for the game to share, but we expect it to be big for us,"" Mehdi said.   —By Reuters "
992,2014-03-03T11:14:08-0500," Microsoft may have led the charge in gesture and voice recognition in the home with Kinect, but the competition is coming fast.  And given the growth in this market—user interface is expected to top $25 billion by 2016, according to Visiongain—there's no shortage of interest in what the company may announce at its Microsoft Build event in April, where the company is expected to focus in part on Kinect 2.0 for Windows.The company isn't talking for now, but some hints can be found in what the competition is working on.For example? The use of human senses, like voice and motion, to improve user interactions with technology. At CES, Intel introduced a new family of devices using what it calls RealSense, which lets users interact with computers in a way reminiscent of the film ""Minority Report.""  (Read more: Pokemon lovers, drop your Game Boy)  ""For decades, people have had to learn new languages, techniques and commands to get our devices to do what we want,"" Mooly Eden, senior vice president, general manager of the Perceptual Computing Group said at Intel's CES press conference. ""Our vision with Intel RealSense technology is to reverse that, and make our devices learn and understand us. By equipping them with technologies that mimic human senses in a more genuine way, our everyday experiences such as learning, communication and gaming are transformed; and entirely new ones are possible.""   Also in the mix? Samsung, which has included gesture and voice recognition in its high-end TV sets for the past few years, and Apple, which last November acquired PrimeSense, the Israeli motion sensor company behind the technology powering Microsoft's Kinect sensor for the Xbox.    Kinect, in many ways, was a trailblazer in the natural interface world. Hackers and developers quickly expanded its voice and gesture recognition abilities beyond the game world. A Spanish company called Tedesys, for example, lets doctors use the device to call up X-rays and other information without having to introduce any potentially nonsterile objects into the operating room.    (Read more: Sony plans slimmer PlayStation Vita in spring)   And Microsoft launched a pilot program, giving businesses (including Toyota, book publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and design firm Razorfish) the tools to develop customized applications for their companies and industries.     Now, with the second generation of Kinect on the market, it's threatening to break through even further.    ""There are aspects of this technology that are more important for consumer and enterprise [uses] than there are for gaming, but gaming has long been a test bed for broader technology,"" notes Billy Pidgeon, an independent market research analyst. ""Gaming is where a lot of new tech is developed. Gamers have a lot more patience for reinstalling drivers and things like that. 'Regular' people won't put up with that.""   (Read more: Billion dollar start-ups are still rare)  With the release of the Xbox One in November, Microsoft unveiled a vastly improved Kinect, with better fidelity, IR technology (letting the device ""see"" in the dark) and biometric scanning. To date, though, there hasn't been a lot of formal chatter from the company (or even the hacker world) on utilizing the technology in other fields.    That's likely to change, though, at Microsoft's Build event. Microsoft sent developer kits to thousands of programmers in late 2013. (The final product will release this summer.)   What are they working on? So far, no one's saying—but it's easy to see how speech technology could be incorporated into making homes more intelligent or how the biometric identification could be used for security features—or to call up relevant information about a person for their doctor or other professional.    (Read more: Apple could be patent war casualty)  Complicating things is the fact that Kinect 2.0 faced some stiff criticism on its release, with users complaining about the spotty reliability of voice commands, a key component.  ""It's a work in progress and it's going to take some time,"" says Pidgeon. ""But I'd be surprised if the stuff that's baked into Kinect doesn't have broader uses. It would be bad strategy if they weren't looking at using that in other venues.""  —By Chris Morris, Special to CNBC.com "

994,2014-02-24T14:21:19-0500," Microsoft is pushing to reach a far wider audience for smartphones running its Windows Phone software by turning to cheaper chip sets and easing restrictions on how phone makers use its software to encourage them to drive down costs.  Nick Parker, Microsoft's senior vice president for handset makers, said the changes have attracted a range of new handset makers to build Windows Phones, including South Korea's LG Electronics, India's Xola and Karbonn, and ZTE, Foxconn, Lenovo, Gionee and Longcheer.  ""We are open for business on Windows Phone to anyone who wants to build a Windows phone,"" Parker said at the Mobile World Congress trade fair on Sunday.  Windows Phones typically sell for several hundred dollars a piece, although Nokia's Lumia 520 handset has an unsubsidized price of about 139 euros ($190) in Europe.  The sub-$100 smartphone market, however, is dominated by Google's   Android operating system, which has lower licensing costs, is more adaptable by device makers, and runs on more, and cheaper, chip sets that run radio and other functions.  Android phones from dozens of handset makers accounted for almost four out of every five smartphones sold, or 781.2 million units, last year, according to Strategy Analytics. Microsoft was a distant third in market share terms, behind Apple, which shipped 153.4 million smartphones.  Some 5.7 million Windows Mobile units were shipped worldwide, Strategy Analytics said. While it gained a more than 10 percent share in some markets, for example Italy, other markets like the United States remained tough, Vice President Joe Belgiore said in Barcelona.  The next major update of the software in coming months would allow it to support less expensive chip sets from its existing supplier, Qualcomm.  Some of the Windows Phone standards would also be eased, Belgiore said.   Microsoft had previously kept a tight grip on hardware specifications, for example insisting on three physical buttons, to create a uniform Windows Phone user experience, regardless of handset maker. That is no longer a requirement, allowing phone makers to use cheaper soft keys and adapt designs used for Android phones.  Belgiore said Microsoft was investing in improvements that would help handset makers get Windows Phone on devices at ""lower costs in terms of manufacturing, licensing and those sorts of things"".  For example, in a bid to reach immigrant workers looking to cheaply call home, Microsoft is including support for dual SIM cards, allowing users to switch phone tariffs to make cheaper local or international calls.  The lion's share of Windows Phones, more than 90 percent last year according to AdDuplex, are made by Nokia. Microsoft is just about to close a deal to buy Nokia's handset business for $7.2 billion. HTC, Huawei and Samsung also make Windows Mobile devices.  ""We will continue to have those iconic devices from our deep partners, but also we'll see an emergence of a lot more of what we call white label phones, maybe operators' phone themselves, retailers' phones,"" Parker said.  Microsoft also said on Sunday it would update its Windows 8.1 operating system, which runs on PCs and tablets, in the coming months after research found traditional keyboard users were less satisfied with the software than previous versions of Windows.  ""We love touch, but we think we could improve the situation for all those keyboard users,"" Belgiore said.  —By Reuters "
995,2014-02-25T09:57:32-0500,"  The pride and jewel of the French tech industry, video-sharing website Dailymotion, is once again in the spotlight with Microsoft confirmed to be in talks to buy a stake, the CEO of the site's owner, Orange, confirmed Tuesday.    Despite launching the same year as Youtube in 2005 the French company's international development stagnated – Dailymotion only has a tenth of Youtube's one billion monthly unique users – and its possible acquisition by Yahoo last year sent the government into fits of protectionism.   But while Yahoo was keen on acquiring a majority stake in Dailymotion, a deal with Microsoft would leave the bulk of capital in France.    In a televised interview aired on French news channel BFM on Tuesday, Stephane Richard, CEO of Orange, confirmed that the rumours circulating about a possible deal with Microsoft were true.  (Read more: François Hollande targets Silicon Valley 'brain drain')   ""We have on-going discussions with, particularly, a big American partner,"" he said before confirming it was Microsoft. ""It doesn't necessarily mean we will reach an agreement, but there is great hope that we will,"" added the CEO.    According to statistics on its website, in late 2012 Dailymotion was the 32nd most visited website in the world, attracting over 105 million unique visitors per month, 85 percent of whom were outside of France. But as it seeks to expand its reach, a partnership with Microsoft would not be the only one on the cards for Dailymotion.    Since the botched negotiations with Yahoo in early 2013, Dailymotion has already reached a number of deals to increase its visibility across the globe, including airing NFL games in some European countries.   ""We are talking to other potential partners, including French ones, but more regarding content,"" the Orange CEO revealed on Tuesday.   Back in 2013, Yahoo and Orange had entered negotiations about a possible partnership, but the discussion soon turned sour over who would retain control of Dailymotion.   (Read more: Microsoft names Nadella as CEO, brings Gates era to a close)  The newly-elected socialist French government which owns a minority stake in telecommunications group Orange, blocked the move. Arnaud Montebourg, the minister for Industrial Renewal argued that Yahoo was out to ""devour"" Dailymotion, and said the government was in favour of a 50-50 percent split so as to not lose this ""pearl of French internet.""   An agreement between Dailymotion and Microsoft would make a lot of sense for both parties involved, argued Richard on Tuesday, explaining however that Orange would keep its majority stake.   ""We wish to keep the majority because we want to remain the masters of Dailymotion's fate, which is a beautiful success story for French internet and that I believe can still benefit to the French innovation ecosystem.""

Any product that meets the price limit will be eligible for the discount, with no restrictions on the type or size of the device.  Sales of Microsoft's Windows 8 system, including its latest Windows 8.1 version, have been relatively slow since its launch 15 months ago.

997,2014-06-20T11:44:45-0400," Microsoft and Google have agreed to add a ""kill switch"" to the next versions of their operating systems for smartphones, following efforts by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman and San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon to publicize the increasingly prevalent crime of smartphone theft. A ""kill switch"" enables a phone's owner to completely disable the device remotely in case it is stolen or lost. Apple's iOS 7 includes the feature, calling it ""Activation Lock,"" though hackers have shown it can be circumvented. Thefts of iPhones reportedly dropped significantly after the iOS kill switch was announced, though, so a similar effect may reasonably be expected for other platforms.

As I previously reported, Mayer is trying to move Yahoo squarely into competition with both Google and Microsoft, in an attempt to regain control over one of its key revenue streams. To do so, she has ordered up two under-the-radar initiatives that could potentially move the company into algorithmic search, as well as search advertising, again.  The internal code names for her not-insignificant efforts — which are not actually being done together, although they are in tandem — are borrowed from sports. In this case, basketball and baseball: Projects Fast Break and Curveball, respectively. Said one source, the projects are being worked in tandem on the organic and monetization sides.  According to people with more detailed knowledge of the plans, Mayer is trying to consolidate it all internally in a plan that is being called the ""three S's"" — Stream, Shopping and Search. But rather than focusing on the Web and keywords, which Yahoo is contractually bound to allow Microsoft to serve under a 10-year search and advertising partnership deal, Mayer is aiming all this toward mobile and contextual search.

1003,2014-02-05T08:54:30-0500,"  In Microsoft's boardroom, it is almost certain that directors grappled with how best to use the search for a new CEO to succeed Steve Ballmer as a way to breathe life into a company that is in the midst of a transformation.   One might think that the best way to bring sweeping change would be to appoint someone from outside Microsoft to be its new leader. However, after a five-month search process, the board decided the best way to transform the company was to appoint a ""company insider,"" as Satya Nadella was labeled in several news articles.   I am always surprised by the attention given to whether a new CEO is an ""insider"" who has worked for the company for an extended period of time, or an ""outsider"" who has been hired into the CEO role without having previously worked for the company.    (Read more: Cramer: Hey, Nadella—Microsoft needs a spinoff now)   My sense of why we are so quick to label a newly appointed CEO as ""insider"" or ""outsider"" has to do with a deeply-held belief that insiders lack the ability to transform a company and instead continue with the status quo while outsiders bring fresh perspective to a business that triggers long-needed change. If one holds this view of insiders and outsiders, then perhaps it was a surprise to see Microsoft's board embrace a ""company insider"" like Mr. Nadella at a time when the company is seeking a transformation.   Keep in mind the fact that most newly appointed CEOs are internal executives. According to the Conference Board, approximately 80 percent of successions involve the appointment of an insider as CEO.    There are several reasons why directors might prefer an insider. Internal executives are familiar with the company; Mr. Nadella was executive vice president of Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise group, a highly-visible and fast-growing division that could represent the foundation of Microsoft's post-Ballmer strategy.    (Read more: Microsoft CEO 'a big deal' for Indians)   It is almost certain that Microsoft's board has had the opportunity to evaluate his performance and leadership style, giving them a greater confidence that he will perform to expectations. Mr. Nadella's experience working with Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Mr. Ballmer ideally will enable a smooth transition with less disruption to day-to-day operations. For these reasons, well-managed companies have directors and executives that spend a great deal of time developing internal talent so that key positions can be filled when vacancies arise.   While Microsoft's board likely values an insider CEO who has been vetted across the years, shareholders and Wall Street analysts are pounding on the boardroom door demanding answers to difficult questions about Microsoft's future. Will the new Microsoft challenge its rivals in the consumer-focused technology market? Or, will the company dominate the enterprise business and simply dabble with consumer gadgets? Who better to bring fresh perspective to such strategic issues than an outsider CEO, who is less tied to the company's current strategy, operating style, management team, and, well, less tied to Messrs. Gates and Ballmer.   Despite the tantalizing possibilities that outsiders may bring, substantial evidence indicates that outsider CEOs perform worse than insiders, particularly when performance is measured using stock returns. Moreover, it seems that outsiders perform particularly poorly when they rush to make strategic changes early in their position as the new CEO, which is a situation that Microsoft's board would certainly like to avoid. This evidence runs contrary to the general belief that outsiders are always a corporate savior in times of significant transformation.    It gets worse: Outsider CEOs generally receive first-year total compensation that is approximately 50 percent greater than that awarded to insider CEOs. Yes, 50 percent greater. Part of this difference can be explained by the fact that outsiders tend to have prior CEO experience, as was the case with a few of the external candidates that were in the running at Microsoft, such as Ford CEO Alan Mulally. But in the end, outsiders generally cost more than insider CEOs at the time of hire.   (Read more: Microsoft CEO decision puts focus on the cloud)   It is true that Mr. Nadella is a ""company insider,"" and we will never observe what Microsoft might have looked like had its board appointed an outsider as CEO.

In a statement, the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant said Bill Gates would step aside as chairman of the board but would remain in an advisory role to the company. John Thompson, who has been the lead independent director, will succeed Gates as chairman. The elevation of an insider, and the transitioning of Gates into a less formal role, was seen by analysts as an effort to rejuvenate a company perceived to have lost its edge in a sector increasingly dominated by consumer technology.  In a move that speaks to the growing importance of social networking, the company utilized Twitter to announce its choice as CEO to the world. In a move that echoed Facebook's branding of its chief Mark Zuckerberg, Nadella is featured in photos sporting crew neck shirts and a hooded sweatshirt.  took Twitter  In early trading on Wall Street, Microsoft shares rose slightly. (What's the stock doing now? Click here)   The move to tap the 46-year-old Nadella brings a protracted search for a new CEO to a close after Steve Ballmer  surprised the technology world by stepping down without a clear successor. In recent weeks, speculation on a new chief centered on Ford's current CEO, Alan Mullaly, who only last month clearly stated he wouldn't take the job. Other rumored names included Oracle's Mark Hurd and Nokia's Stephen Elop.  (Read more: Ford CEO Mulally says he won't leave for Microsoft)   In his 22 years at Microsoft, Nadella has led the company's cloud-computing infrastructure, which includes Bing, Xbox and Microsoft Office. He is only the third CEO in Microsoft's 39-year history, following co-founder Gates and Ballmer.   (Read more: Microsoft's new CEO: An insider and a 'cloud' man)   In an email to Microsoft staff, Nadella acknowledged there was work to be done.   ""While we have seen great success, we are hungry to do more. Our industry does not respect tradition—it only respects innovation,"" Nadella said. ""This is a critical time for the industry and for Microsoft.""    The appointment of the Hyderabad, India-born Nadella appears to answer a dispute that was said to have riveted Microsoft's search committee earlier in the process, which was reportedly divided on whether Microsoft needed a visionary or a technocrat. Gates was a highly regarded innovator, yet Ballmer—who was burdened by his mentor's shadow—never successfully managed to bring the company into the new era of tablets, smartphones and the software that runs them.   As a result, the company has been largely become an afterthought in a world dominated by mobile computing. With giants like Apple, Samsung and Google  dominating consumer technology, Microsoft's new CEO put the world on notice that he intends to fight for a seat at that table.   ""Our job is to ensure that Microsoft thrives in a mobile and cloud-first world,"" Nadella said in a message to employees.   —CNBC.com with Reuters   Text of Satya Nadella's e-mail to Microsoft Employees:   Today is a very humbling day for me. It reminds me of my very first day at Microsoft, 22 years ago. Like you, I had a choice about where to come to work. I came here because I believed Microsoft was the best company in the world. I saw then how clearly we empower people to do magical things with our creations and ultimately make the world a better place. I knew there was no better company to join if I wanted to make a difference. This is the very same inspiration that continues to drive me today.  It is an incredible honor for me to lead and serve this great company of ours. Steve and Bill have taken it from an idea to one of the greatest and most universally admired companies in the world. I've been fortunate to work closely with both Bill and Steve in my different roles at Microsoft, and as I step in as CEO, I've asked Bill to devote additional time to the company, focused on technology and products. I'm also looking forward to working with John Thompson as our new Chairman of the Board.  While we have seen great success, we are hungry to do more. Our industry does not respect tradition — it only respects innovation. This is a critical time for the industry and for Microsoft. Make no mistake, we are headed for greater places — as technology evolves and we evolve with and ahead of it. Our job is to ensure that Microsoft thrives in a mobile and cloud-first world.   As we start a new phase of our journey together, I wanted to share some background on myself and what inspires and motivates me.    Who am I?    I am 46. I've been married for 22 years and we have 3 kids. And like anyone else, a lot of what I do and how I think has been shaped by my family and my overall life experiences. Many who know me say I am also defined by my curiosity and thirst for learning. I buy more books than I can finish. I sign up for more online courses than I can complete. I fundamentally believe that if you are not learning new things, you stop doing great and useful things. So family, curiosity and hunger for knowledge all define me.   Why am I here?    I am here for the same reason I think most people join Microsoft — to change the world through technology that empowers people to do amazing things. I know it can sound hyperbolic — and yet it's true. We have done it, we're doing it today, and we are the team that will do it again.   I believe over the next decade computing will become even more ubiquitous and intelligence will become ambient. The coevolution of software and new hardware form factors will intermediate and digitize — many of the things we do and experience in business, life and our world. This will be made possible by an ever-growing network of connected devices, incredible computing capacity from the cloud, insights from big data, and intelligence from machine learning.   This is a software-powered world.   It will better connect us to our friends and families and help us see, express, and share our world in ways never before possible. It will enable businesses to engage customers in more meaningful ways.   I am here because we have unparalleled capability to make an impact.   Why are we here?   In our early history, our mission was about the PC on every desk and home, a goal we have mostly achieved in the developed world. Today we're focused on a broader range of devices. While the deal is not yet complete, we will welcome to our family Nokia devices and services and the new mobile capabilities they bring us.   As we look forward, we must zero in on what Microsoft can uniquely contribute to the world. The opportunity ahead will require us to reimagine a lot of what we have done in the past for a mobile and cloud-first world, and do new things.   We are the only ones who can harness the power of software and deliver it through devices and services that truly empower every individual and every organization. We are the only company with history and continued focus in building platforms and ecosystems that create broad opportunity.   Qi Lu captured it well in a recent meeting when he said that Microsoft uniquely empowers people to ""do more."" This doesn't mean that we need to do more things, but that the work we do empowers the world to do more of what they care about — get stuff done, have fun, communicate and accomplish great things. This is the core of who we are, and driving this core value in all that we do — be it the cloud or device experiences — is why we are here.  What do we do next?   To paraphrase a quote from Oscar Wilde — we need to believe in the impossible and remove the improbable.   This starts with clarity of purpose and sense of mission that will lead us to imagine the impossible and deliver it. We need to prioritize innovation that is centered on our core value of empowering users and organizations to ""do more."" We have picked a set of high-value activities as part of our One Microsoft strategy. And with every service and device launch going forward we need to bring more innovation to bear around these scenarios.   Next, every one of us needs to do our best work, lead and help drive cultural change. We sometimes underestimate what we each can do to make things happen and overestimate what others need to do to move us forward. We must change this.   Finally, I truly believe that each of us must find meaning in our work. The best work happens when you know that it's not just work, but something that will improve other people's lives. This is the opportunity that drives each of us at this company.  Many companies aspire to change the world. But very few have all the elements required: talent, resources, and perseverance. Microsoft has proven that it has all three in abundance. And as the new CEO, I can't ask for a better foundation.   Let's build on this foundation together.   Satya "
1005,2014-02-04T07:27:21-0500,"  Take one last look at the Microsoft board because it could soon be experiencing big changes.   Reports suggest that Bill Gates could step down as chairman. The move would be huge as there are few people more closely aligned with a company than Gates is with the behemoth he co-founded.   (Watch: Microsoft nears end of CEO search)   Tech news site Re/code reports that the move is predicated on Gates getting more involved at the company. Satya Nadella, who is reportedly the top choice to be the next CEO, has asked Gates to help address technology and product problems at the software giant.   If he steps down as chairman, Gates could remain a first-among-equals director. Analysts say Gates would likely feel more comfortable giving up the role as chairman if Nadella is named CEO. The two men are both technologists with deep backgrounds in computer science.   (Watch: CNBC's top 25: Herb likes Bill Gates)   ""With Satya Nadella heading Microsoft, Gates feels like he's leaving the house in good hands, "" said FBR Capital Markets' Dan Ives. ""I think you could give away the keys at this point knowing there is a core Redmond insider taking over, and it is obviously someone that has his blessing.""   Who would replace Gates if he steps down as chairman? Reportedly, the man leading the search for the new CEO, John Thompson. A former CEO of Symantec, he has been described as a charismatic leader. But his own career has been marked with missteps.   In the 10 years under Thompson's watch, Symantec's revenue rose tenfold to $5.9 billion.   However, he also oversaw Symantec's acquisition of Veritas in 2004. The acquisition was designed to merge two fast growing industries: storage and security. But there was no overlap between the companies' customers, analysts say, and Thompson left Symantec in far worse shape because of it.   (Watch: Apple is more inventive than Microsoft: Swisher)   Calls to Thompson were referred to Symantec, but the company declined to comment.   As for Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's current CEO, it's unclear whether he will stay on the board. His track record leading Microsoft is mixed. He more than tripled revenue to $77 billion, but Ballmer also missed big tech trends such as mobile and social. The stock under his watch is down about 20 percent.   Analysts also question the personal dynamics between Ballmer and Nadella if Ballmer remains on the board. Nadella worked for Balllmer for years. Would he have the courage and confidence to stand up to Ballmer in a boardroom showdown? It's an open question for Nadella, who has never worked as a CEO.  —By CNBC's Josh Lipton.

1006,2014-02-04T09:36:42-0500,"Satya Nadella, a Microsoft 22-year veteran who headed the software giant's Cloud and Enterprise group, has taken the helm as chief executive officer, in a move by the company that reveals a lot about its strategy moving ahead.   While several analysts told CNBC last week that the choice of Nadella, 46, makes strategic sense, it also would be considered a safe bet. Nadella has been leading Microsoft's cloud division, and it would be a clear signal that enterprise software is, and will continue to be, the focus of Microsoft's strategy.  Re/Code's Kara Swisher first reported that Microsoft was closely considering Nadella as CEO. Microsoft offered no comment on the report at that time. Microsoft's search committee worked hard for six months to find a new CEO to succeed Steve Ballmer.   ""The Cloud is the epicenter of Microsoft's future success. They're really going for the golden jewel within the enterprise. More and more, spending is going toward the cloud. For Microsoft to be a very relevant player, they need to have success in the cloud, which speaks to why Mr. Nadella is front and center as the potential CEO,"" Dan Ives, vice president at FBR Capital Markets, told CNBC last week.   (Read more: Microsoft tapsNadella as CEO; Gates era ends)   It wouldn't be going out on a limb to say Nadella is a Bill Gates/Ballmer disciple. The Hyderabad, India-born Nadella has background in electrical engineering and computer science, and if there is one thing he's very familiar with, it's how business is conducted at Microsoft.   Some analysts, however, have said that Nadella may be too much of a Microsoft insider. Some analysts were hoping for an outsider to invigorate Microsoft's leadership with new energy and gravitas.    ""At the end of the day, the optimism around Microsoft is that you could get a fresh perspective, an outsider, someone who's willing to make tough decisions with the enterprise and consumer business. Do you spinoff Xbox? Now that they're going with an insider, it looks like that's off the table,"" Ives said.   (Read more: Microsoft earnings easily beat Street expectations)   While Nadella knows the cloud and the ways Microsoft works, he has no experience as a CEO. And this isn't just any company, Microsoft's market cap is nearly $313 billion, third in the tech sector behind Google's $396 billion, and Apple's $446 billion.   ""I think for Satya not having been a CEO and stepping in to what will soon be a 130,000-person company, he's going to be a work in progress probably for awhile, kind of ramping up,"" said Rick Sherlund, head of U.S. technology equity research at Nomura Securities. ""There's so much for him to accomplish strategically and operationally.""   Sherlund added: ""I think they wanted someone that has a good technical background and will be there for the next 10 years, but it's not quite the immediate gratification you get if you were to bring in someone like Alan Mulally  who's used to running a very big company that's gone through a turnaround.""   (Read more: Mulally says he's pleased to get past Microsoft speculation)   ""He's done a great job on the cloud,"" Ives added. ""That's definitely his best characteristic and ultimately why he got the job, but with that said, he's still a core Redmond insider, and is he going to be the guy who's going to make strategic moves that some investors hope for? I don't believe so. I think there's some optimism that now has faded with the insider pick.""   Sherlund also said a Nadella-led Microsoft is likely to come with a very different board of directors. The company announced Tuesday that John Thompson will be elevated to chairman, succeeding Gates, and that Gates will remain a technology advisor to the company.   Currently, Microsoft's board has several people who aren't from the technology sector.   (Read more: What to expect from Apple, Microsoft and Facebook)   ""He's going to need help, and the board is going to have to be persistent,"" Sherlund said last week. ""I think this board, in particular, probably is going need some help and will need to bring in some tech people onto the board as well.""    And while Sherlund said he has some reservations about Nadella, he's glad Microsoft is finally taking some action.   ""Steve Ballmer's been the CEO for the past 10 years and there's been a tremendous destruction of shareholder value over that period. Bill Gates has been the chairman of the board over that time, and this board hasn't done much to enhance shareholder value, so I think that there's a need for change at the board level, as well as changes at the management of the company,"" Sherlund said.    Ives said he wants to see change at Microsoft and feels by elevating Nadella and Thompson, Gates and Ballmer are setting their guys up for the future.   ""With Satya heading Microsoft, you feel like Gates feels like he's leaving the house in good hands, and I think you could give away the keys at this point knowing that there's a core Redmond insider taking over, and it's obviously someone that has his blessing,"" Ives said. ""But with that said, losing Bill Gates is still a historic change. ... I think investors would be really focused on ... the next 12 to 18 months down the road."" —By CNBC's Mark Berniker and Josh Lipton.

While Cramer lauded Microsoft's most recent quarter, he said the company sorely needs someone to ""start reshuffling the deck"" and cause ""fundamental change.""Cramer also questioned the move to keep former CEO Steve Ballmer on Microsoft's board of directors, contending that the outgoing executive should expand his horizons.

1011,2014-01-22T18:46:27-0500,"  Microsoft will allow foreign customers to have their personal data stored on servers outside the U.S., breaking ranks with other big technology groups that until now have shown a united front in response to the American surveillance scandal.   Brad Smith, general counsel of Microsoft, said that although many tech companies were opposed to the idea, it had become necessary following leaks that showed the U.S. National Security Agency had been monitoring the data of foreign citizens from Brazil to across the EU.   (Read more: NSA hacks Microsoft error messages: Report)  ""People should have the ability to know whether their data are being subjected to the laws and access of governments in some other country and should have the ability to make an informed choice of where their data resides,"" he told the FT.   Mr Smith added that customers could choose where to store their data from a variety of existing Microsoft data centers. For example, a European client could choose to have their data stored in the group's Irish data center.   The scandal over the NSA's illicit internet surveillance and the bulk collection of phone records has caused tensions between the U.S. and even some of its closest allies. The revelations sparked a global backlash, from calls for tighter privacy rules in Europe to a draft law in Brazil that would require all data about citizens to be held inside the country. Internet companies argue that this would balkanise the internet, turning it into a patchwork of national or regional systems.   Microsoft's gesture was immediately welcomed by privacy advocates, though it looked set to open a rift between the tech companies as they struggle to deal with the damage from the surveillance scandal.   ""It's incredibly positive,"" said Jeff Chester, a U.S. privacy campaigner. ""If they're really making a public commitment to store [data] locally then they will be breaking with the rest of the industry.""   (Read more: No Microsoft CEO decision until at least February)   Some critics of the idea have questioned whether such a move would be effective in putting the personal data of non-Americans outside the reach of the NSA, since U.S. tech companies have to hand over information about specific users when ordered to by a secret U.S. court, regardless of where it is held.   However, keeping the information off U.S. soil and under local data protection rules should make it harder for the NSA to tap into illicitly, Mr. Chester said. ""If the data are not being transported, then it does stop that kind of access.""   The Microsoft offer follows a joint statement from the main U.S. Internet companies last month denouncing any requirement to hold data locally, as has been proposed in a draft law in Brazil.   A person at one leading internet company, who refused to be named, said on Wednesday that being forced to set up data centers in every country would be prohibitively expensive, especially for start-ups that cannot afford facilities in multiple countries.   Mr. Smith acknowledged that it would be expensive but added ""does it mean that you ignore what customers want? That's not a smart business strategy.""   (Read more: World of spycraft: NSA infiltrates gamers' data)   Following revelations made by Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor, EU companies and consumers have become concerned about the way U.S. tech groups such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft share their data with U.S. authorities.   Although all major U.S. tech companies have denied giving American security agencies a ""back door"" into their networks, overall trust among many of their service users in Europe remains low by their own admission. ""Our entire industry is concerned that some customers outside the U.S. are feeling less confident with [American] online services today,"" Mr. Smith said. ""Technology today requires that people have a high degree of trust in the services they are using . . . The events of the last year undermine some of that trust [and] that is one of the reasons new steps are needed to address it.""  Expert panel to probe internet governance Syrian Electronic Army hacks Skype Apple denies it knew of alleged hacking bid   Mr. Smith also said that the U.S. and EU should consider signing an international agreement that ensures they will not try to seek data in each other's territory via technology companies.   ""If you want to ensure that one government doesn't seek . . . to reach data in another country, the best way to do it is . . . an international agreement between those two countries. Secure a promise by each government that it will act only pursuant to due process and along the way improve the due process.""

1013,2018-12-11T08:39:26-0500,"The top 20 stock buyback programs in corporate America have spent $1.4 trillion buying back their own shares since the Great Recession ended.Most of the stocks being repurchased by company management have not outperformed the S&amp;P 500.Three stocks that spent heavily on buybacks, in particular, should make their investors very mad: Citigroup, GE and IBM.The bull market that began after the Great Recession has been propelled (in large part) by one factor: a stock buyback program. The bigger, the better, as far as investors were concerned. If you add up the amount of money the top 20 corporate buyback programs have spent in the past decade on their own shares, it comes out to more than $1.4 trillion, according to data from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.The buyback craze — which remains at record levels — has meant that the biggest buyers of stocks throughout the bull market run have been companies, not regular investors. But how many of those 20 stocks have outperformed the S&amp;P 500 since 2009? Only five.Now with stocks off their highs and many in bear market territory — a decline from an all-time high of 20 percent or more — it is becoming clearer that corporate treasurers are as bad as everyone else is when it comes to market timing. In fact, the buyback effect on stocks is waning, as evidenced by two popular exchange-traded funds that track buyback indexes.The SPDR S&amp;P 500 Buyback ETF (SPYB) is down this year by about –2.5 percent, trailing the S&amp;P 500, which it also has trailed over the past one-year and three-year periods, according to Morningstar data. The Invesco BuyBack Achievers ETF (PKW) is down by about 4.5 percent this year, and also has trailed the S&amp;P 500 in recent years. Over the past 10 years, though, it is a different story. The S&amp;P 500 Buyback Index has generated a return of 17 percent on an annualized basis, beating the S&amp;P 500 by 3 percent.Here is the problem with buybacks, even if the long-term data makes a decent case for them: This is the wrong market to still be doing them.Buybacks work best when stocks are coming out of a bear market because the buybacks act as an accelerant. But companies spent too much of their cash without accepting that economic cycles do eventually proceed rather than stay in place, and eventually turn, and companies that do not have ample cash on hand heading into a recession are more likely to fail. That's what happened to GM in the last recession. GM bought back a ton of shares before finally needing to be bailed out by the government, $20.4 billion from 1986 to 2002 alone.It is evident that the U.S. economy is slowing and the bull market is looking wobbly with almost half of the S&amp;P 500 now in a bear market. So corporate officers would do well to make sure they have ample cash on hand. Some companies that have spent liberally on buybacks over the past decade continue to beat the market, but not many, especially after the recent market rout.According to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices on buyback programs through the third quarter of 2018 and Morningstar data on stock performance through Dec. 10, only five companies have managed to generate annualized returns over the past decade that are above the S&amp;P 500's total return of 14 percent: Apple, Home Depot, Microsoft, Disney and Intel.Other companies that spent billions on buybacks will soon be wishing they could have that cash back. Here are three that should make investors mad.Take General Electric. Last Friday the company made official its dividend cut to just a penny a share. It has a massive debt load that is rated just one notch above junk, and its cash flow is a growing worry for investors. I'm willing to bet anyone that the $46 billion GE spent over the last decade on buybacks, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, and the $24 billion the company spent on buybacks in 2016 and 2017 alone, would be better served in its checking account, giving it more runway to restructure the company back to profitability.Today the stock is in the $7 range, which means a share can't even buy you a meal combo at McDonald's. And with the dividend just a penny per share, you'll still need to reach into your pocket to pay the sales tax on your meal combo. By the way, GE was trading above $30 a few years ago. It's down almost 60 percent just this year alone.IBM spent an eye-popping $83 billion on buybacks after the Great Recession, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. A lot of those purchases were funded with cheap debt. So with the purchase of open-source cloud software Red Hat, in a transformative deal to get IBM back to growth, it is planning to issue even more debt for the $34 billion deal.It makes sense to use a combination of cash and debt when making deals, especially when rates are low. But a company would do better taking on debt, cheap or not, for reinvesting back into the business, not on buybacks that over the long term don't help a company's stock if business results don't justify it. My frustration with IBM's approach can be summed up in this question: After taking on debt for buybacks, now you want to take on debt for an acquisition?With IBM's stock down over 20 percent this year and having been stagnant for years, the company could have used its cash much earlier during a difficult transition from mainframe technology to open-source software, cloud computing and artificial intelligence.Finally, there's Citigroup, which announced a buyback of more than $15 billion about a year and a half ago and is No. 20 among all companies buying back debt over the past decade, at $45 billion in share repurchases. With the yield curve either flat or inverting, investors are concerned that the bank's earnings will be crimped. The stock is down by over 20 percent this year. Well, maybe now that it's down, it might be a good time to crank up its buybacks, but so far shareholders haven't seen a dime of return.It is a problem that is pervasive in the bank stock sector. J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon has said several times recently that he prefers reinvestment in the business to buybacks, especially when stocks are pricey. That doesn't change the fact that J.P. Morgan is No. 8 among all companies in share repurchases over the past decade, with over $67 billion spent on buybacks.Investors should be furious with the managements of some of these companies. The most famous one of all, Warren Buffett, sold all of his IBM in spite of IBM's buybacks. Just last quarter Berkshire bought $4 billion worth of J.P. Morgan shares. Buffett has remained a fan of buybacks when done for the right reasons and done after careful analysis of a company's intrinsic value. He bought back near $1 billion in Berkshire Hathaway shares earlier this year — but Berkshire also is sitting on more than $100 billion in cash.Apple has bought back more than twice as much stock as any other company over the past decade, but it also has been generating the most cash in the history of corporations. Even after buying back $250 billion in shares, it has almost that much in cash on hand left in its coffers today — $237 billion at the end of the last quarter. Could Apple have used the $250 billion it spent on buybacks for more useful things like acquisitions? Only time will tell, but to me, every company in this market should be working harder to justify buybacks. Buybacks may have gotten the market to its recent records, but they are not a useful determinant of where a stock is headed from here.I know that it is obvious to say that companies that get into trouble will need cash to survive, but it is infuriating to me when companies like GE, Citi and IBM spend on buybacks when they should've been reinvesting into their businesses or just saving for a rainy day. Nothing over the long haul can compensate for a misallocation of capital.The point is that all companies eventually face obsolescence and recessions. Those are the times when cash is needed most. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos is very open about how Amazon could one day face bankruptcy. As hard as that is to believe, it has happened to many companies that were industry leaders. Apple faced bankruptcy twice in its corporate history. Maybe it should learn from its own past and realize that in the world of technology, every company is always only one product ahead of the new thing.In the last 10 years, there has been a big equity to debt conversion because that's what happens when companies borrow to fund buybacks. I think that's a danger in the next recession. Capital has been abundant in this era of cheap money, but that game is ending, and capital will become scarce in an era of tighter central bank policy. Once we are there — and we are getting closer — many of the companies that spent lavishly on buybacks will be wishing they had been a little more strategic with their cash.—By Mitch Goldberg, president of investment advisory firm ClientFirst StrategyWATCH:Why you shouldn't panic when stocks are getting slammed"
1014,2014-01-13T11:50:09-0500,"  What tech companies are poised for big things in 2014? Not all companies are destined for glory, but there are a few names to keep an eye on, said Philippe Laffont, founder and CEO of Coatue Management.Laffont, whose tech focused hedge fund has $9 billion under management, broke down what to expect from some top tech companies this year on CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""    (Read more: Five tech trends for investors to watch in 2014 ) Apple may be ready to unveil something big this year, Laffont said.   ""I'm sort of wondering what Apple is going to do right now, they haven't done anything for a couple of years and I kind of hope this is the year they will,"" he said.   Laffont, whose firm has a large position in Apple, said he expects the company to make a big move into the home space, though he didn't specify exactly what that might be.    ""It's been sort of a tough stock for the last couple years, but we have a large position around these prices,"" Laffont said. ""I just find it strange that this is one of the great stocks selling at one of the cheapest multiples in the market, and something is going to change.""Microsoft needs to restructure this year but probably won't, Laffont said.   ""It's strange. It seems no one wants to be the CEO, and there's two ex-CEOs on the board,"" Laffont said. ""This is a story, where if someone was allowed to do basic stuff, the stock could double. So many cost-cutting opportunities, so much restructuring opportunities.""   Laffont said it's unlikely the next CEO will be able to do what's necessary because Microsoft is trying to keep up with the competition when it comes to innovation.   ""When you see the innovation of Apple and Google and you're Microsoft, you don't want to cut all this R&amp;D because you are thinking, 'I want to get back to be just like Apple and Google,'"" he said.   ""But in the meantime, what they need is restructuring. I think the R&amp;D cost at Microsoft is five times the size at Apple, but they don't seem to be coming up with anything new."" Social media companies' valuations will continue to perplex in the next year, Laffont said.   ""These are tough companies because the companies are so great, but sometimes the valuation, you scratch your head,"" he said. ""The key with Facebook and Twitter is to figure out five or 10 years out, is it really two or three times earnings? Or not?""    Laffont said he is very optimistic about Facebook with its Instagram platform, in particular. He also said he expects Snapchat, the ephemeral photo sharing app, to continue to expand.    —By CNBC's Cadie Thompson. Follow her on Twitter @CadieThompson. "
1015,2014-01-16T05:26:56-0500," Microsoft is considering Ericsson AB Chief Executive Hans Vestberg as a possible successor to outgoing CEO Steve Ballmer, Bloomberg cited sources briefed on the software giant's executive search as saying on Wednesday.   Bloomberg did not report on whether the company has reached out to Vestberg, who as CEO of the Swedish firm runs one of the world's largest telecommunications equipment makers.   His naming may come as a surprise to many on Wall Street.   Analysts have discussed potential candidates ranging from company insiders Satya Nadella and Tony Bates to several outsiders. But speculation refocused on internal choices this month after leading external candidate, Ford Motor CEO Alan Mulally, took himself off the list.   (Read more: Ford CEO Mulally: Happy to get past Microsoft speculation)   Sources familiar with the company have told Reuters that, with Mulally out of the running, the list of candidates able to run a globe-spanning software corporation struggling to expand into the mobile software and devices markets was thin.   Analysts say Microsoft may have to look at ""dark horse"" candidates, but noted that some widely reported tech sector candidates, including Pivotal Inc CEO Paul Maritz, have already declined to take the job.   In a blog post on the company's website in December, Microsoft's lead independent director John Thompson, who is spearheading the search, emphasized the need for a CEO with good tech credentials and ""an ability to lead a highly technical organization and work with top technical talent.""   (Read more: No Microsoft CEO decision until at least February)   Reuters could not immediately verify Bloomberg's report, and Ericsson was not immediately available for comment.   Microsoft declined comment. A sourceclose to the company has said no CEO appointment was likely until the last week of January or February.  "
1016,2014-01-07T18:36:21-0500," Alan Mulally is staying at Ford .      The CEO, who was rumored to be in the running to become Microsoft's next leader, told The Associated Press Tuesday that he won't leave the Dearborn, Mich., automaker before the end of 2014.     ""I would like to end the Microsoft speculation because I have no other plans to do anything other than serve Ford,"" Mulally said in an interview.      When asked if this should end investor concern about his departure, Mulally said, ""You don't have to worry about me leaving.""    Mulally said he will stick with his plan to stay at Ford through at least the end of 2014. Ford announced that plan in November 2012. At the same time it promoted Mark Fields to chief operating officer, making Fields the likely successor to Mulally. (Watch: Ford Dec sales up 1.8% but misses estimates)      Over the last few months, there have been numerous reports that Mulally was on the short list of candidates to replace Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Microsoft announced in August that Ballmer plans to step down as CEO.      Mulally wouldn't say if he had talked to Microsoft about becoming CEO. But he said the speculation was a distraction for Ford.       Mulally, 68, was trained as an aeronautical engineer. He spent 36 years at Boeing  -- and was president of the company's commercial airplane division -- before Ford Chairman Bill Ford lured him to the struggling automaker in 2006. He is widely credited with returning the company to profitability and changing the culture, ending widespread executive infighting.      During his tenure, Ford has earned $32.9 billion in pretax profit and its shares have more than doubled.      Microsoft wouldn't say Tuesday whether Mulally's announcement was a surprise.      ""Out of respect for the process and the potential candidates, we don't comment on individual names,"" a Microsoft spokesman told the AP.      Ford shares rose 20 cents to $15.58 in after-hours trading. Microsoft shares fell 37 cents to $36.04. —By The Associated Press  "

1018,2011-08-03T14:31:36-0400,"The Yacktman Fund's Donald Yacktman, the mutual-fund manager with the best record in the past 10 years, has boosted his holdings in out-of-favor stocks, including scandal-plagued media giant News Corp. and troubled computer-networking bellwether Cisco Systems . The manager of the $5.4 billion fund also initiated a big position in Research In Motion , maker of the beleaguered BlackBerry smartphone, and added to a stake in Hewlett Packard , both of which have seen their shares slide this year. Yacktman made the changes in the second quarter, according to information from Morningstar and Bloomberg. In addition to stocks, the Yacktman Fund bought a boatload of U.S. Treasury bills, despite the volatility that swirled around the sector in the run-up to the debt ceilingdebacle, which threatened to cause their devaluation. President Barack Obama signed a debt-limit compromise Tuesday, the day the U.S. would have failed in its ability to pay all of its obligations, such as Social Security and personnel salaries.The Yacktman Fund has risen 4.9 percent this year while the benchmark S&amp;P 500 Index is little changed. Over five years, the mutual fund has risen an annual average of 10 percent, more than five times the pace of the S&amp;P 500. That makes it the No. 1 mutual fund, a distinction it also holds over three, 10 and 15 years. But the Yacktman Fund doesn't only protect investors from market downturns—it rockets in bull markets. In 2009, as the S&amp;P 500 Index jumped 26 percent, the fund rose a staggering 59 percent. That's why investors have added more than $2.4 billion to the fund in the past year. Donald Yacktman started the fund in 1992 and his management team now includes his son Stephen Yacktman and Jason Subotky.The Yacktman Fund gets a ""buy"" rating and a five-star grade from TheStreet Ratings, which indicates the fund has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk. It won TheStreet's 2011 Best Mutual Fund award for the large-cap core category. The fund currently holds 38 stocks and 53 percent of its assets are concentrated in its Top 10 holdings. It also has 16 Treasury bond holdings of varying sizes. There is a slim 10 percent annual portfolio turnover, indicative of a buy-and-hold strategy. The fund's largest sector weighting is consumer services, at 30 percent of the portfolio, followed by consumer goods, at 28 percent. The fund sold out its 1 million share stake of personal-computer maker Dell in the period. Its shares are up 20 percent this year. Here are five of the fund's big buys of out-of-favor stocks during the second quarter: News Corp. is the fund's largest holding, at 10.7 percent of the portfolio, after it added 3.4 million shares in the second quarter. That stake now has a market value of $575 million.The company is still in the midst of a phone-hacking scandal that includes potential criminal charges against current and former employees, and its ethics and policies may come under review in other countries and could potentially impact CEO Rupert Murdoch's empire. The political backlash in the U.K. has already resulted in its dropping its bid for the British satellite broadcaster BSkyB. News Corp.'s shares are up 11 percent this year, but down 10 percent over the past three months after the scandal broke. Its board recently authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program, which should help support share prices. The company is a media conglomerate with a wide range of assets: filmed entertainment; television's Fox Network; 35 TV stations; and Star, a television network in Asia. It also has cable network programming; direct-broadcast satellite television (Sky Italia); magazines and inserts, and newspapers in Australia, the U.K. and in the U.S., and it owns the book publisher HarperCollins, and its online properties including MySpace. The Yacktman Fund boosted its Microsoft stake by 1.7 million shares in the second quarter, bringing its total holdings to 10.6 million shares, or 5.1 percent of the fund, worth $275 million. Microsoft, which has a market value of $228 billion, has seen its shares decline 1.1 percent this year, but they are up 8 percent over the past 12 months. Long-term, its shares have a lackluster five-year annualized return of 4.4 percent. Microsoft, the developer of the Windows PC operating system, the Office suite of productivity software, and enterprise server products such as Windows Server and SQL Server, is now transitioning into cloud-computing products  , which is a move to Web-based applications, which means it's entering new markets.Among its recent efforts, the company has partnered with phone maker Nokia , and that is expected to drive large market-share gains for the Windows Phone platform and create the next $1 billion-plus annual revenue stream for the company, Morningstar says. The fund almost tripled its stake in Cisco Systems   to 15 million shares in the second quarter, worth $234 million, making it its fifth-largest holding at 4.3 percent of the fund. Cisco has been struggling of late, and its shares are down 21 percent this year. Given its size and reputation, it has a competitive advantage in its core markets of network routing and switching devices. But it faces tougher competition in its core markets, and its management's efforts at diversifying its product line has resulted in a lack of focus, analysts say. Cisco has a market value of $86 billion and also holds $27 billion in cash of its balance sheet. Its shares are down 31 percent over the past 12 months and its shares have a three-year average annual loss of 10 perrcent. The fund's Hewlett Packard stake grew by 1.1 million shares in the quarter to 3.4 million, worth $124 million, making it the fund's 16th-largest holding at 2.3 percent of the portfolio. Its shares are down 16 percent this year and 23 percent over the past 12 months, as the information-technology giant has seen continued erosion in its consumer-oriented personal-computer markets.And data-center and networking biggies are elbowing their way into HP's traditional markets, and that increased competition could bring margin pressure. Oracle is also pushing into HP's traditional business hardware and services markets so it's seeing tougher competition on many fronts. The fund bought 1.5 million shares of Research In Motion , initiating a stake worth $43.3 million during the second quarter, which is a 0.8 percent portfolio allocation. The company is best known for being an early innovator of wireless-communications devices with its BlackBerry product line, but it has lost market share to Apple's iPhones and Motorola's Android line of devices. The Waterloo, Ontario-based company announced the layoff of 2,000 workers on July 25 as part of a ""cost-optimization program,"" whereas Apple has been hiring staff. Research In Motion has a market value of $13.1 billion and its shares have a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 4.7 versus the Standard &amp; Poor's 500's 14.2. It had an annual average earnings growth of 53.4 percent over the past five years, while its revenue grew from $300 million in fiscal 2003 to almost $20 billion in fiscal 2011. But its shares are down 49 percent over the past three months and 57 percent this year. Over the past three years its shares have averaged an annual decline of 41 percent.______________________________CNBC Data Pages:Dow 30 Stocks—In Real TimeOil, Gold, Natural Gas Prices NowWhere's the US Dollar Today?Track Treasury Prices Here______________________________ Disclosures:TheStreet's editorial policy prohibits staff editors, reporters and analysts from holding positions in any individual stocks.Disclaimer"
1019,2013-12-18T13:01:36-0500,"  Ford CEO Alan Mulally appears less likely to become the next chief executive at Microsoft as the software company seeks ""dark horse"" candidates from Silicon Valley rather than Detroit, Nomura's Rick Sherlund told CNBC on Wednesday.   Sherlund, head of technology equity research at Nomura, cited a blog post published Tuesday from Microsoft board member John Thompson reiterating founder Bill Gates' statement that the chief executive was ""a complex role to fill, involving a complex business model and the ability to lead a highly technical organization and work with top technical talent."" Thompson said he expected the board to finish its search in early 2014, and his statement leaves Sherlund less confident that Mulally would head for Microsoft after Ford.   ""Just reading between the lines, ... [it] implies that maybe the dynamics of the board are shifting from just a good general manager who could help enhance shareholder value and can work with technical people who could fix the business,"" Sherlund said on ""Squawk on the Street."" ""It seems to me that perhaps Bill Gates is digging in his heels now and saying, 'We want technical leadership.'""   (Read more: Microsoft expects early 2014 CEO choice)   Wall Street would most likely prefer a proven, all-purpose manager such as Mulally rather than someone with a technical background, such as former Microsoft and VMware executive Paul Maritz, Sherlund said.

Microsoft's stock has seen a 30-percent increase in the past year. However, closing out the end of the year without naming a successor to CEO Steve Ballmer makes it an ""awkward time"" for investors.

1022,2013-12-17T11:58:58-0500,"  The White House is rebooting HealthCare.gov's repairman.   Former Microsoft executive Kurt DelBene will take over the volunteer job of overseeing ongoing fixes to the federal Obamacare marketplace HealthCare.gov starting Wednesday, officials said.   DelBene is replacing management guru Jeffrey Zients, who was tapped by President Obama in October to manage the emergency repair job on that then-badly crippled website.    The switch comes at a critical time for HealthCare.gov, which has seen dramatic performance improvements under Zients. The site, which had very low enrollment levels in the first two months of operation because its tech troubles, now is engaged in a furious effort to sign up as many people as possible in new Affordable Care Act insurance by the New Year   DelBene, who retired last summer as president of the Microsoft Office division after two decades at the software behemoth, is the husband of US Rep. Suzan DelBene, (D-Wash), a fellow ex-Microsoft executive who was elected to Congress in 2012. Before Microsoft, DelBene was a management consultant with McKinsey and Company, and a software developer and systems engineer for AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories.   Officials said DelBene has agreed to stay on the job of managing HealthCare.gov for at least the first half of 2014, which would include the March 31 deadline for open enrollment on that and other Obamacare exchanges.   Although he will be paid for his work, DelBene plans on returning all of that money to the US Treasury, the White House said.   Zients was originally scheduled to start his new job as director for the National Economic Council at the beginning of 2014. But on Tuesday it was disclosed that Zients will take that job after the State of the Union address on Jan. 28. In the meantime, Gene Sperling will stay on as council director until Zients takes over.   ""I am pleased to announce Kurt Del Bene as my Senior Advisor and successor to Jeff Zients,"" said Kathleen Sebelius, secretary for Health and Human Services in a blog post on HHS's site on Tuesday.   Sebelius said, ""The President and I believe strongly in having one person, with strong experience and expertise in management and execution, who is thinking 24/7 about HealthCare.gov. ""   She lauded Zients for doing ""an outstanding job working with our team to provide management advice and counsel on the HealthCare.gov project,"" saying the site  now ""is night and day from what it was when it launched on October 1.""   ""I am very grateful for his service and leadership.""   Sebelius said DelBene ""will be a tremendous asset in our work"" because of his ""proven expertise in heading large, complex technology teams and in product development.""     She also said his responsibilities, while similar to those of Zients, will reflect the fact that the site has improved in recent months.   DelBene will ""provide management expertise, operations oversight, and critical advice on additional enrollment channels, field operations, marketing and communication."" He also ""will execute the plan in place, so that we can ensure the site's performance is strong through the close of open enrollment on March 31,2014,""  Sebelius said.  ""This will include a focus on increasing system stability, redundancy and capacity, and building on improvements to the user interface, while continuing to prioritize security and privacy issues in line with industry best practices.""  DelBene's wife, Rep. DelBene, in a statement said,  ""I'm pleased that the President has appointed Kurt to help oversee the continued improvement and implementation of the federal HealthCare.gov website website.    ""The fact remains that there are millions of Americans who do not have access to affordable, quality healthcare today. To change that, it's critically important that HealthCare.gov works as it was supposed to.""   ""With his long career in the private sector, Kurt has the unique combination of skills and experience as an executive in the technology industry to manage a project the size and scope of HealthCare.gov,"" Rep. DelBene said. ""I've long said that we need more people to enter public service who are focused on delivering results. Kurt has demonstrated throughout his career that he is about results, and his decision to join the Administration will be extremely valuable to their efforts to improve the website.""Kurt DelBene also won praise from his former bosses at Microsoft, including company founder Bill Gates.""Kurt is a talented and capable executive, with a track record of successfully managing complex large-scale technology projects,"" Gates said.  ""Working with Kurt over many years, I know him to be a passionate advocate for using technology to solve difficult problems at scale. He brings deep expertise as a manager and engineer to his new responsibilities. I'm certain he'll make an important positive contribution in his new role with HHS."" (Read more: More Obamacare extensions)   Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said  ""Kurt's a phenomenal leader who established Microsoft Office as a world-class service for billions of people. Clearly, Kurt's technical and business skills will be invaluable in his new endeavor."" When DelBene takes over on Wednesday, he will be facing a less dire situation than the one Zients had to deal with after his appointment in late October.Nearly two months of widespread software and hardware fixes made by government workers and private contractors during Zients' tenure at HealthCare.gov have left the site functioning much better than it had been after its botched Oct. 1 launch, with quicker load times and a sharply reduced error rate.   But it still needs to process what officials predict will be several millions enrollments in coming months. And the construction of a back-end system that handles critical financial transactions for insurers who sell plans on the site has been repeatedly postponed because of the frantic rush to fix the consumer interface.Although enrollment on HealthCare.gov has greatly increased after the site was essentially relaunched at the beginning of December a slew of upgrades the pace of sign-ups is believed to still be well below the rate needed to hit 7 million enrollees nationwide by the close of enrollment in March, the target set by Obama officials.   For coverage that would begin Jan. 1, consumers have until next Monday to enroll in insurance bought through either the federal or state-run Obamacare exchanges.   —By CNBC's Dan Mangan, with additional reporting by Eamon Javers.

Historical analysis over the last two years through June 1 shows the fund would have outperformed the Russell 1000.The billionaire investor said that Microsoft topped the most recent ranking thanks to its attention to the pay gap between its male and female workers. The software giant has 100 percent compliance on pay equity, Tudor Jones said, meaning that the company conducts surveys to ensure that women are paid just as much as men are.""There was a poll recently conducted: 51 percent of millennials between 18 and 29 [years of age] are opposed to capitalism.

""In the past 40 years we've had an 80 percent increase in worker productivity, but they've only shared in 10 percent of that.""The JUST fund seeks to track the JUST U.S. Large Cap Diversified Index (JULCD), constructed and managed by JUST Capital, a nonprofit co-founded in 2013 by Tudor Jones. The famed hedge fund investor also said a number of new companies have made their way into the JUST Capital Rankings, which tracks a selection of Russell 1000 companies based on how just each performs on the priorities of the American public. ""If you don't have really well incentivized, smart, engaged workers, you're not going to have a product and you're not going to have customers,"" Tudor Jones said Monday on ""Squawk Box."" ""The reason we started Just Capital was because we want to make capitalism work for all. We're trying, through the private sector ... to change the most important thing in all of our lives — which is our work — in a way that's going to give us a society that's more sustainable.""The Goldman Sachs JUST fund is down about 5 percent since it launched in June. FactSet data show the S&amp;P 500 down 5.1 percent since June 13, while the JUST fund is down 5.6 percent.Jones, who rarely talks to the press, has a net worth of $4.5 billion, according to Forbes. Tudor Jones in 1988 founded the Robin Hood Foundation, a charity that counts many Wall Street leaders as board members and is focused on fighting poverty in New York City."

Microsoft held its annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday, but didn't name a new CEO or even indicate when a new CEO will be announced.

""I think Microsoft will give us a number of great products in the future, but it has had some pretty big struggles in the last few years,"" Turrentine said.

1031,2013-11-19T12:22:48-0500,"  Nokia confirmed the sale of the Finnish mobile telecoms group's handset unit to U.S. software giant Microsoft at a shareholders' meeting on Tuesday, with   speculation heating up over the future of both businesses.    More than 99 percent of shareholders voted to approve the sale at the meeting in Helsinki at 2 p.m. local time (7:00 a.m. New York time). The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014. Nokia shares closed around 3 percent lower on Tuesday. In September this year, Nokia agreed to sell its devices and mapping services business and to license its patents to Microsoft for 5.4 billion euros ($7.2 billion). The deal proved controversial because it marks the end of the iconic Finnish handset brand. Following the sale, Nokia said in a statement that it planned to focus on developing ""advanced technologies, its patent portfolio and Nokia brand.""  At the announcement of the deal back in September, Nokia's chief executive, Stephen Elop, said he would step down to rejoin his old employer, Microsoft. His three-year tenure at Nokia has proved controversial — particularly over his decision in 2011 to adopt Microsoft Phone software over the company's own operating system.    (Read more: Is Elop being groomedto take over top job at Microsoft?) James Crawshaw, IT and Telecoms analyst at S&amp;P Capital IQ, told CNBC he believed the sale would allow Nokia to invest further in its other divisions.  ""They're left with the networks business which is the third largest globally after Ericsson and Huawei and they've also got a small sideline in mapping content for satellite navigation devices and they also have a patents portfolio that they're looking to monetize more aggressively going forward.""   He believed Nokia's network sales would stabilize in 2014 and would grow thereafter following what he called a ""remarkable turnaround"" by the group's networks division in 2013.   ""The Nokia networks [division] continues to be a profitable business and I think there's also a fair amount of expectation about this patents portfolio and that its profits could be increased after the disposal of its handset business.""

1032,2013-11-13T14:23:32-0500,"  Let the games begin.   The unveiling of Sony's PlayStation 4 on Nov. 15 and  Microsoft's Xbox One on Nov. 22 doesn't just mark a new console cycle but is a new start of sorts for the companies: The former is trying to right the ship after years of losses, while the latter is moving to expand its empire beyond the PC desktop.    ""The launches are of extremely high strategic importance to both of them, but for different reasons,"" said P.J. McNealy, founder of Digital World Research. ""Sony as a corporation is looking for a new product line to breath life into the brand—and the PS4 has a chance to do that. For Microsoft, the Xbox One launch is the anchor to try to grab consumer mind-set as part of a bigger approach with tablets and phones.""   (Read more: A jolly holiday for video games in store)   Both companies have solid track records in gaming. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 have sold over 80 million units each, and both makers have pledged to continue supporting their legacy models.    But game publishers expect the next-generation consoles to quickly become dominant.    ""Our feeling is the installed base of these machines will be much faster to take hold than previous generations,"" said Tony Key, vice president of U.S. sales at Ubisoft. ""In the first couple of years, we expect them to double the installed base of previous generations in the same time period. ... The games are going to get so much better on the new [consoles] that you're going to have to have one.""  Analysts are similarly upbeat about the new consoles. While the degree of optimism varies, most believe the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will be catalysts that spark a sales boost for the industry.    ""Gamers have been hibernating for the past few years, waiting for the new technology,"" said Jesse Divnich of video game research firm EEDAR. ""It looks like ... during the first year we could see sales increase. [This] week we're going from playing on a console designed eight years ago to one that was created today.The gaming divisions are notable parts of the larger Microsoft and Sony environments. While both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 have had disappointing sales this year because of the looming launch, they have been strong performers historically.   (Read more: 'Grand Theft Auto' staggering sums)  Sales of the Xbox 360 last holiday season led Microsoft to sales of $6.62 billion in its second fiscal quarter. And the company says Xbox One will be profitable at launch—a rarity in the gaming industry, which typically sells hardware at a loss and compensates in software sales.  PlayStation 3 sales struggled initially but have rebounded toward the end of this cycle, and gamemakers have noted that developing for the PS4 is significantly easier than for its predecessor.    For two systems that will fight so fiercely for customers, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are shockingly similar in a number of ways. Both have notably faster processors and offer features to share in-game video. Both come with Blu-ray/DVD drives. Both have a heavy focus on digital downloads and offer cloud storage. Neither will play the games from their predecessor.    (Read more: Is the video game industry finally rebounding?)  The Xbox One also comes with the Kinect sensor. That's a big part of the reason it costs $499—$100 more than the PS4—and will eventually offer original video content, including a live-action series built around its ""Halo"" franchise, which is produced by Steven Spielberg. Meanwhile, the PlayStation 4 will tap the resources of corporate cousin Sony Entertainment for content tailored specifically for the gamer audience. Given that the PS4 is one of the tentpoles of Sony's turnaround effort, the division expects to see support from other units.   ""People realize that the PlayStation 4 is very important for the company and are looking to lend their resources,"" Jack Tretton, president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America, said in June. ""What's good for us is good for them, not only in terms of being good corporate citizen, but in helping them drive toward their financial goals.""  (Slideshow: 'Grand Theft Auto': Hookers, violence, and outrage)   Microsoft is looking to conquer the living room with both games and mainstream entertainment content. Beyond its original programming, the company has struck a deal with the NFL to enhance games for fans via the Xbox One dashboard.    ""People like to watch TV and like to play games,"" Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's chief marketing and strategy officer, said at E3 earlier this year. ""It's the hits that drive adoption growth and business success. In gaming, the big hits for us are things like 'Halo'. We want to find some big hits on the TV side that open people's eyes as to what's possible. And the NFL is one of those.""   Both Sony and Microsoft hope to avoid Nintendo's fate when the Wii U debuted last last year. A lack of compelling software and unclear consumer messaging have resulted in less than 4 million units sold. (The Wii had sold over 13 million units at the same age.)   Colin Sebastian, senior equity research analyst at R.W. Baird, projects worldwide Xbox One and PS4 shipments at 5 million to 6 million by year's end. Some analysts have predicted the PS4 will be the top seller, but he said Xbox One will have equal  or even higher sales by the close of the launch window. Analysts dismiss claims by some gamers that console makers hold back inventory during the holidays to create buzz.  (Watch: Golden age of video games)   ""You want to have shortages ... but not at the expense of losing a couple million units of sales,"" said Eric Handler, senior equity analyst at MKM Partners.   Analysts also said the price differential won't matter much this holiday season. Price is much less important to core gamers—the primary buyers—than bragging rights that go with having the newest generation. McNealy of Digital World Research said volumes probably will hit a point in about 18 months at which manufacturers see cost savings they can pass on to the public.  Of course, games also drive demand for consoles.  (Slideshow: 10 must-have games this holiday)   Divnich expects big franchises, including Activision's ""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" and Electronic Arts' ""Battlefield 4,"" to be big, adding that early console buyers tend to stock up.

""People generally buy up to five different pieces of software in the first six months, so games like ""Knack,"" ""Forza"" and ""Killzone"" will do well.

1033,2013-11-12T10:01:24-0500,"Watch out Microsoft and Dell, Apple is coming after your bread and butter.   The iPhone and iPad maker is pushing into the business market, putting pressure on those hardware and software companies that have long relied on corporate clients for profits.  ""Apple is moving into the enterprise in a dramatic way, mostly with iPhones and iPads. It's not dominating in computers yet, but it's certainly growing,"" said Ted Schadler, a Forrester analyst. (Read more: How bad, outdated technology is costing companies)  The tech giant is doing everything from lowering the cost of its devices and giving away its software for free to ramping up security features to woo enterprise customers. And its efforts are working, analysts say.   In fact, Apple has already expanded its presence in businesses significantly in recent years. In North America, 18 percent of employees said they use an Apple device for work, according to Forrester data. Just a few years ago, that number was more in the 3 percent range, Schadler said.   The biggest force driving Apple into the workforce is simply because consumers want it there.  ""It is the pull of the consumer, or the employee, who is helping Apple grow traction, both in mobile and in laptops,"" said Trip Chowdhry, an analyst at Global Equities Research. ""Apple products are fundamentally built for ease and it has a user-centric interface. Microsoft does not. Employees feel more productive using Apple products, forcing IT managers to bring it in.""  While consumer adoption no doubt got Apple's foot in the enterprise door, the company now appears to be trying to expand its business clients in a more proactive manner. Apple appears to be increasing its internal support to attract and better serve enterprise customers. The company has posted multiple job listings on LinkedIn for positions at Apple that focus on growing its presence in enterprise.  One job listing posted to LinkedIn on Monday was for an   Apple Enterprise Sales Representative.    ""We are actively searching for an Enterprise Sales Executive focused on selling to the Fortune 1000 ideally out of irvine or San Diego CA,"" the company said in the listing.    Requirements for the position also include a ""high-level understanding of IT infrastructure around device management, security, and infrastructure integration,"" according to the job post.    Other enterprise-focused positions recently listed include roles in technical support and other enterprise sales positions. In early October, Apple also hosted a recruiting event not far from BlackBerry's headquarters outside Waterloo, Ontario, where it was speculated that the iPad maker looked to recruit some of BlackBerry's enterprise architects, Schadler said.    Historically, analysts said that Apple has had a strong sales team focused on the education market, but not for the enterprise sector. Such a shift would be significant for Apple and its competition, Chowdhry said.    ""So far, Mac has been successful without a sales team. Now, if you put a sales team in, that could create magic for Apple,"" Chowdhry said. ""It's more bad news for Dell, Microsoft and the HPs of the world, though.""   CNBC reached out to Apple to find out if the company was in fact making a concentrated effort on expanding it enterprise sales and support staff, but the company declined to comment.Still, it's hard to deny the recent jabs Apple has taken at Microsoft, especially its announcement to give away its iWork productivity software and its updated Mavericks OS for free.   (Read more: Apple increasingly adopting freemium model)   ""They are giving away a lot more software than they used to give away, and this puts pressure on Microsoft. It doesn't destroy their business model, but it puts pricing pressure on them,"" Schader said.    But Apple is making many other inroads into enterprise besides free software. The biggest way Apple is into the business world is in mobile.    With enterprise vets like BlackBerry and Microsoft having fumbled in mobile, the company is seeing most of its growth in the space come from iPhone and iPad users.  (Read more: Why things will only get worse for BlackBerry)Businesses are expected to account for 18 percent of all tablet sales by 2017, according to data from Forrester Research, and that bodes well for Apple because it has the biggest tablet market share in the enterprise realm, analysts said.   ""For Apple, it's an aggressive move. They have cut out a nice space in the enterprise market, especially with their iPad,"" said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Gartner. ""Enterprises are finally figuring out what the tablets can do and how they can be used.""   Apple's chief financial officer, Peter Oppenheimer, even made it a point to highlight during the company's fourth quarter earnings call late last month how companies were adopting its mobile devices and building in-house apps to enable employees to be more productive.    (Read more: Apple earnings: It's all about iPhone sales)  In fact, nearly 35,000 companies worldwide, accounting for millions of employees, are building custom apps for the iPad and iPhone, Oppenheimer said during the call.    In addition, in the second and third quarter of this year, the iOS platform accounted for 98 percent and 95 percent of total enterprise mobile app activations, according to data published in August from Good Technology, a company that sells mobile software to businesses.    This is pretty significant considering that only a few years ago IT departments shunned Apple's mobile products and platform because they were considered too expensive and difficult to control.    Yet because Apple's iPhone and iPad devices grew so dramatically, the enterprise market has been forced to accept Apple as a vendor.     But it's not just consumer adoption that is driving IT departments to implement Apple devices, it's also because Apple is increasingly considered to have a safer platform than other vendors.    Enhanced security features like the new fingerprint sensor in Apple's new iPhone 5S to unlock the device are likely to make it more appealing to IT heads, Schadler said. Developers still can't use the new feature in their apps, but that's likely to change in the future and in the interim there is an extra layer of security because the user's fingerprint is required, he said.    In addition, mobile's ecosystem is more heavily guarded than its competition.    ""With Apple, you have the walled garden of iOS, which is much more secure than Android, which is an open platform"" said Timothy Lesko, a principal at Granite Investment Advisors, which owns more than 20,000 Apple shares. ""Most companies are being dragged to Apple because it makes more sense.""   ""Apple is a much better platform, Android is much less secure and Microsoft is just woefully late,"" Lesko said.    A similar argument can be made when a corporation is rolling out new laptops, Chowdhry said. Corporations have to consider what tech companies will provide lasting support and which ones have a working strategy, he said.    ""Have you come across any laptop manufacturer that has said 'this is my strategic focus?' No, HP is struggling, Dell is struggling, Sony is going into the gutter and Acer just missed its numbers,"" Chowdhry said.    ""If you are a CIO, CEO or another executive and you are sitting here and you have to make a decision between Apple, Microsoft and others, are you going to bet on Hewlett Packard, Windows, or are you going to Apple?"" —By CNBC's Cadie Thompson.

1036,2013-11-15T17:23:42-0500," Steve Ballmer, who has been leading Microsoft for more than 30 years, said the best way for the tech giant to enter a new era is to hire a new leader who can speed up the change, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.  Ballmer said in August he would retire within 12 months. He told the Journal that he couldn't lead the company forward and referred to himself as ""an emblem of an old era.""  (Read more: Oracle's Mark Hurd: Microsoft move 'not planned')   Investors and the board of directors were pushing for a fast transformation, especially in the areas Ballmer had overlooked: phone, tablet and Internet services.

The world's largest software maker also has at least three internal candidates on its shortlist, including former Skype CEO Tony Bates, who is now responsible for Microsoft's business development, and Satya Nadella, the company's cloud and enterprise chief, the sources said. Despite the narrower list—the company started with about 40 names—the process could take a few more months, the sources said. In August, Ballmer said he would retire within 12 months.  (Read more: Oracle's Mark Hurd: Microsoft move 'not planned')  The names of other candidates could not be learned, but the search committee is interviewing executives from a wide range of sectors, including life sciences and consumer, the sources said.   Microsoft declined to comment on the process and on behalf of the internal candidates. A Nokia representatives could not be reached immediately for comment late on Tuesday.   Ford spokesman Jay Cooney said: ""There is no change from what we announced last November. Alan remains fully focused on continuing to make progress on our One Ford plan. We do not engage in speculation.""   Investors have pushed Microsoft's board in recent months to look for a turnaround expert, such as Mulally or Computer Sciences CEO Mike Lawrie, to succeed Ballmer. Some investors have also suggested to the board that co-founder Bill Gates should step down from his role as chairman, saying he stands in the way of radical reform at Microsoft.   Microsoft remains highly profitable and last month beat Wall Street's quarterly profit and revenue forecasts. But it has lost ground to Apple and Google in mobile computing.   Ballmer has focused on making devices, such as the Surface tablet and Xbox gaming console, and turning key software into services provided over the Internet.   Some investors say that a new chief should not be bound by that strategy. They are concerned that, with both Gates and Ballmer up for re-election to Microsoft's board, they will retain their influence over the company.   (Read more: Nokia,Microsoft attempt to rain on Apple's parade)   Gates has focused his day-to-day efforts on philanthropy since 2008 when he vacated his office on campus. People close to him say he is not considering a return to the CEO position.   Members of the CEO search committee have been speaking with dissenting shareholders, according to sources familiar with the conversations.   Activist shareholder ValueAct Capital Management was offered a board seat by Microsoft in August. Several sources said the investor will also be given the same access as the board to the final five candidates.  CEO candidates   Mulally, 68, is credited with inspiring a cultural change that helped Ford reverse its losses and avert a federal bailout in 2009.   It remains unclear when Mulally will leave Ford, which he has led since 2006. He has repeatedly said he plans to adhere to his agreement to stay with Ford until the end of 2014.  But people familiar with the matter have previously said that Mulally is open to other opportunities and may leave Ford earlier if another job presents itself.

The Nokia deal, which came soon after Ballmer's surprise decision to retire, was widely seen as putting Elop among the list of successors.   Meanwhile, the two known internal candidates have been gaining prominence within Microsoft.   Bates came to Microsoft two years ago as CEO of the acquired Skype and was recently elevated to lead the technology giant's business development and overall strategy.

1041,2013-10-22T06:33:59-0400,"  Both Nokia and Microsoft - soon to be part of the same smartphone brand - have each released tablet devices on Tuesday, just hours before Apple is expected to unveil updated versions of the iPad and iPad Mini.   Nokia, the Finnish company that last month merged its handset division with Microsoft in a 5.44 billion euro ($7.43 billion) deal showed off its first ever tablet, the Lumia 2520, in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday morning. With a 10.1 inch full-HD display and a 6.7 megapixel camera, the Lumia also runs on Windows 8.1 RT software - a version of the Windows 8 operating system designed for mobile devices.    At the launch, the company revealed the Lumia 2520 would come with both Wi-Fi and 4G LTE connectivity as standard -- so you can use it on the go. The tablet will be available in red, white, cyan and black and is expected to be in the shops at some point during the last three months of 2013. Initially it will launch in Finland, the U.K, and the U.S. and its estimated price is $499 before taxes or subsidies. Apple's current offering, with a higher-resolution retina display is available on its online store for the same price.    (Read More: Apple's new iPad 5 may look a lot like iPad mini)  ""It stands out,"" Carolina Milanesi, research VP at Gartner Research told CNBC. ""The design is different, the keyboard is different. Although it does not have a retina (display) the screen is good enough. There is a lot going for it except the price.""    Milanesi added that the price could be reduced once Microsoft take over the reins, but an additional drawback would still be the Windows RT software which, she says, puts it in a ""tough place"" compared with Apple iPads. Analysts have criticized the software, with several profile glitches being reported, as well as a lack of third-party apps which many see as a reason why consumers favor Apple's iOS and Android.  Annette Zimmermann Ian Fogg  As well as the 2520, five other devices were released in at the company's annual Nokia World event, held this year in Dubai, with ""phablet"" smartphones, the Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320, being unveiled and three updates to its low-end Asha range.    Meanwhile, Microsoft themselves started selling its new Surface 2 tablet in the U.S. at midnight Monday. The device is sold as a faster, more powerful version of its previous model and continues to try to compete with Apple's iPads, however, according to technology websites like CNET, the launch was failing to attract buyers.   (Read more: Apple's new retail chief is no stranger to tech)   But according to Milanesi this could soon change. Nokia would bring better design and a better understanding of the mobile ecosystem for Microsoft and give it more of a fighting chance in the consumer market, she said.

The iPad 5 is expected to be thinner and lighter than its predecessor, while the iPad mini 2 is likely to include a high-resolution ""retina"" display, analysts says, with some speculating the latter could also include a fingerprint sensor.

1044,2013-10-01T09:20:44-0400,"  Value investor pioneer Bill Miller—with a hot hand after buying Netflix and Best Buy last year—is now talking up Apple and Microsoft.   In an interview Tuesday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" Miller made a case for why he thinks Apple shares are trading at ridiculously low levels of about $476 each as of Monday's closing price. ""It just makes no sense for Apple to trade where it is: Seven times enterprise value to free cash flow.""   He also said, ""Microsoft has been a terrible stock for a decade. It started out stupidly overpriced and now it's stupidly underpriced."" In the past 10 years, Microsoft stock has gained 18 percent. But year-to-date, it's up 25 percent.  Miller is portfolio manager of the Legg Mason Opportunity Trust, which returned nearly 40 percent in 2012. The fund—with $1.5 billion in assets under management—owns shares of Apple and Microsoft.   (Read more: Lehman a 'kindergarten show' next to any default, says Miller)  He said an Apple ""double is probably not likely"" in the next 12 to 24 months. ""[But] if it takes two years to get back to where it was a year ago, it's 50 percent"" higher from current levels. Apple stock has dropped more than 30 percent since its all time highs of more than $700 a share back in September 2012.   On Microsoft, he said, ""They raised the dividend actually 15.9 percent per year on average for the last five years. But the last dividend increase was 22 percent. And I think it's much more likely the dividend increase is going to be 20 percent or more the next five years.""   Miller explained, the psychology game surrounding a stock can turn around on a dime. ""When Netflix was at $60 and now it's $300, that was a year ago. Best Buy was $13, now it's $38. The psychology can change quickly.""   A couple of other major value investors also appeared on ""Squawk Box"" Tuesday and they decided to look at Apple after Miller's call.   John Rogers Jr., chairman and CEO of Ariel Investments, said: ""Bill has made a very compelling case. … We have to re-look at Apple for our large cap product.""   ""Bill Miller said Apple's a no-brainer. I think I'll buy some Apple today,"" said Harvey Eisen, chairman and CEO of Wright Investors' Service Holdings. He's also chairman of Bedford Oak Advisors.   Eisen also likes Microsoft and gave a shout out to billionaire Warren Buffett. ""Hi Warren, how are you?""   ""You just gave $50 billion to a guy named Bill Gates,"" Eisen continued. ""Microsoft trades at 10 times earnings and yields 3.5 percent and raises the dividend 15 percent a year. Even you Warren, can buy with your position.""   Asked about his recommendation for Buffett, Rogers recommended a stock he owns: ""International Speedway, they own those Nascar tracks. They got a new contract, up 46 percent with Fox and NBC. It's terrific."" The broader market and the Fed   As for the overall stock market, Miller said he agrees with billionaire investors Carl Icahn and Warren Buffett: ""The market is roughly fairly valued.""   (Read more: Did the Fed just pop the stock market bubble?)

""[But] it's very hard to find things that you can say would reasonably have a chance to be up 50 percent to 100 percent in the next 12 to 24 months.""

1045,2013-10-01T21:50:45-0400,"  Three of the top 20 investors in Microsoft  are lobbying the board to press for Bill Gates to step down as chairman of the software company he co-founded 38 years ago, according to people familiar with matter.        While Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has been under pressure for years to improve the company's performance and share price, this appears to be the first time that major shareholders are taking aim at Gates, who remains one of the most respected and influential figures in technology.    A representative for Microsoft declined to comment on Tuesday.     (Read more: Ballmer goes out punching at last Microsoft meeting)   There is no indication that Microsoft's board would heed the wishes of the three investors, who collectively hold more than 5 percent of the company's stock, according to the sources. They requested the identity of the investors be kept anonymous because the discussions are private.    Gates owns about 4.5 percent of the $277 billion company and is its largest individual shareholder.     The three investors are concerned that Gates' presence on the board effectively blocks the adoption of new strategies and would limit the power of a new chief executive to make substantial changes. In particular, they point to Gates' role on the special committee searching for Ballmer's successor.    They are also worried that Gates - who spends most of his time on his philanthropic foundation - wields power out of proportion to his declining shareholding.    Gates, who owned 49 percent of Microsoft before it went public in 1986, sells about 80 million Microsoft shares a year under a pre-set plan, which if continued would leave him with no financial stake in the company by 2018.     (Read more: Cramer: Microsoft's dividend is a move of desperation)   Gates lowered his profile at Microsoft after he handed the CEO role to Ballmer in 2000, giving up his day-to-day work there in 2008 to focus on the $38 billion Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.    In August, Ballmer said he would retire within 12 months, amid pressure from activist fund manager ValueAct Capital Management.    Microsoft is now looking for a new CEO, though its board has said Ballmer's strategy will go forward. He has focused on making devices, such as the Surface tablet and Xbox gaming console, and turning key software into services provided over the Internet. Some investors say that a new chief should not be bound by that strategy.    (Read more: Can Bill Gates save Microsoft?)   Microsoft is still one of the world's most valuable technology companies, making a net profit of $22 billion last fiscal year. But its core Windows computing operating system, and to a lesser extent the Office software suite, are under pressure from the decline in personal computers as smartphones and tablets grow more popular.     Shares of Microsoft have been essentially static for a decade, and the company has lost ground to Apple and Google in the move toward mobile computing.    One of the sources said Gates was one of the technology industry's greatest pioneers, but the investors felt he was more effective as chief executive than as chairman.  "

He departed to the strains of Michael Jackson's ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin',"" the song played at Microsoft's first employee meeting in 1983, followed by ""(I've Had) The Time of My Life"" from the finale of ""Dirty Dancing,"" getting a standing ovation from the 13,000 or so Microsoft full-time employees in attendance.   (Read more: Microsoft boosts dividend by 22%, sets $40 billion buyback)  ""We have unbelievable potential in front of us, we have an unbelievable destiny,"" said a visibly moved Ballmer, reusing a quote from the 1983 meeting. ""Only our company and a handful of others are poised to write the future,"" he continued. ""We're going to think big, we're going to bet big.""   Ballmer, who announced his plan to retire within 12 months in August, was the last act of the all-day event at Seattle's KeyArena, former home of the city's SuperSonics basketball team.   Thousands of full-time Microsoft employees showed up, most of them bussed in from Microsoft's campus on the east side of Lake Washington—while an estimated 25,000 more tuned in via webcast.   The event is an annual traffic nightmare for Seattle, with 220 buses making the 15-mile journey from Microsoft's campus in Redmond to the center of the city.   During his time on stage, Ballmer talked about telling his parents about deciding to drop out of Stanford's business school to join Microsoft on 1980, recalling that his father—a long-time Ford Motor  executive—asked him what a personal computer was.   (Read more: Cramer: Microsoft's dividend is a move of desperation)  He dwelled on his new plan to transform the company from a software-centric operation into a more innovative devices and services company, which he said would make it ""fundamentally more powerful.""

Partner deals typically represent multiyear contracts with bigger companies as they involve large-scale projects.Terry Wise, vice president of global alliances and channels at AWS, said in his keynote that the total deal size brought in by partner sellers has increased 3.5 times compared with last year, while the rate of growth in partner-led contracts is far outpacing the growth of AWS' overall business.Those numbers show AWS customers making bigger upfront commitments, giving Amazon a more predictable revenue stream for future years, according to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill.""It suggests customers are doing 'cannonballs' into the pool versus just dipping their toe in,"" Thill told CNBC. ""Bigger commitments mean we have more confidence in revenue as most customers won't leave AWS once they commit.""AWS became popular with its pay-as-you-go model, which helped draw many start-ups because it only charged for the amount of computing power they used. But as AWS matured, and became more popular across businesses of all sizes, multiyear contracts with upfront commitments, typically preferred by corporate clients, have come to account for a larger share of its revenue.Perhaps that explains why AWS started disclosing ""performance obligations"" this year, which it defines as future revenue ""associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized."" In its most recent quarter, that amount grew to $17.8 billion, up from $16 billion in the second quarter and $12.4 billion in the first quarter.It also added a line about such deal structures in its latest earnings filing, saying AWS offers certain services that are ""offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably.""Lydia Leong, an analyst at Gartner, said she's seeing the same trend among her own clients. AWS is signing both more deals and vastly larger deals compared with its main competitors, Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud, she said.""The bulk of AWS deals for Gartner clients are in the range of $5 million to $15 million, with many deals now exceeding $30 million, which is significantly higher than Azure (which tend to be below $1M) and GCP (typically below $5M),"" Leong said in an email to CNBC.Leong said the more interesting trend is the growing number of ""renegotiations"" — deals in which the customers are quickly blowing past their commitments due to new unexpected projects or business growth, and are compelled to renegotiate a new higher commitment in return for a bigger discount.At re:Invent, AWS announced a number of large enterprise deals with companies like Amgen, Capital One and Verizon. Korean Air, for example, committed to a 10-year deal that would move all of its infrastructure needs to AWS.Although most multiyear contracts with enterprise customers come with discounts, they haven't slowed down AWS' revenue growth. In the latest quarter, AWS revenue jumped another 46 percent, to $6.7 billion, up from the year-ago period's 42 percent growth rate.""We're very happy with the growth in the business — the momentum that we're seeing with enterprise customers,"" said Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky during October's earnings call.In a statement to CNBC, Microsoft expressed satisfaction with its progress against AWS. ""We continue to see rapid growth in our cloud business, with Azure revenue in Q1 growing 76%. Our differentiation continues to be in the partner approach we take with our customers to drive success for their business, and this in turn drives increased consumption of our cloud services. We have significant engagements with global brands including Starbucks, Volkswagen, Shell, Walmart, Chevron, and BMW to run and grow their businesses with Azure.""Google did not immediately return a request for comment."

It is also expected to include Intel's Haswell processor, which will help increase battery life. The Surface 2 is expected to have a 1,080-pixel display and to look pretty much the same as its predecessor.   Microsoft is also rumored to be preparing to pull back the curtain on some accessories, including a docking station and a tablet cover (called the ""Power Cover"") that both charge the device and act as a keyboard, according to a report from   tech blogger Paul Thurrott.  —By CNBC's Cadie Thompson.

The new Surface Pro 2 is lighter and thinner and features 75 percent longer battery life. It is 95 percent faster than all laptops on the market, the company said. It also comes in a new silver color and features a new dual-angle kickstand option. The new device will begin pricing at $899.   (Read more: Microsoft paying for Apple's next product cycle )  Upgrades in the Surface 2, which is the second generation Surface RT, include a 25 percent increase in battery life, a new processor and a new silver magnesium case, which gives the device a new look. Like the Surface Pro 2, it also includes a dual-angle kickstand.   The Surface 2 is going to market cheaper than its predecessor, starting at about $449. The Surface RT hit the market at $499 when it was released.    So far, Microsoft hasn't had much success in the tablet market.   In early July, the company announced a $900 million charge to write down the value of the unsold Surface RT, which the company launched last October. At the end of July, the company--which also launched the Surface Pro in February--had only brought in about $853 million from its Surface sales.    The company only sold a little over one million units of its earlier Surface tablets, so the devices didn't really move the needle for the company's stock, said Rick Sherlund, an analyst for Nomura Securities, on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Monday. While it's likely the company will have more success with its new tablets, it's not likely the device will appeal to the mass market, he said.   'It's going to have to prove itself in the market, because cool technology really isn't quite enough. It really has to find its niche in the market,"" Sherlund said. ""And the good news is I think the market is going to be more receptive this time than it was last time, but it's still an uphill battle for them to establish themselves in the hardware business."" The Surface tablets are more for productivity use than just consumption, so it has a stronger appeal to the business user, he said. ""if you want a tablet, you just buy an iPad. The mass market who just wants a consumption device will just buy a pure tablet."" he said. ""This is more for productivity use. It's a notebook that can function as a tablet, but I think you really have to appeal to the notebook, productivity buyer here, more so than a consumer who just wants a tablet.""  The tech giant revealed on Monday some new accessories for the devices that give it an edge as a productivity tool, one of which is a cover that also functions as a power source. The new cover extends the battery life, while also functioning as an attachable keyboard.    It also revealed a docking station that can click in with a display port and can power two monitors at the same time.    The docking station has been expected for some time and is aimed at appealing to the enterprise customer. The new accessory, though, is only compatible with the Surface Pro and Surface Pro 2 tablets.    Microsoft also tried to appeal to non-enterprise consumers by emphasizing the size of its app store.    ""Last year we launched this product with 10,000 apps. This year I stand up in front of you and there's 100,000 apps in the Windows Store right now. That's critical,"" said Panos Panay, who leads Microsoft's Surface team, at the event.

The Surface 2, which replaces the Surface RT, is supposed to be lighter and four times faster than before.  It comes with a 3.5 megapixel camera and a better screen.    Jason Maynard, senior analyst at Wells Fargo, said a lack of applications was a problem with the first generation of the Surface. The Surface 2 has 100,000 apps. He's not impressed, ""So far I can't see any big surprise.""   Panos Panay, corporate vice president at Microsoft and chief of Surface, said the big theme of the Surface 2 is ""productivity.""

Ballmer, who in August said he planned to step down within 12 months, told investors and analysts in an annual meeting on Thursday that Microsoft had a bright future, despite missteps during his 13-year tenure.   ""We have the tools. There's economic upside here. In the long run, we are almost uniquely poised to seize the opportunity,"" he said, in a typically high-volume presentation. ""Today I'm speaking as an investor. You all own Microsoft stock, cheer for it, for God's sake.""   Ballmer, who took over from co-founder Bill Gates as CEO in 2000, did acknowledge that under his leadership the company was too focused on Windows to realize that Apple's iPhone was revolutionizing computing.   (Read more: Microsoft bets on rapid online growth)  ""If there's one thing I regret, there was a period in the early 2000s when we were so focused on what we had to do around Windows that we weren't able to redeploy talent to the new device form factor called the phone,"" said Ballmer.   After losing ground to Apple and Google in mobile and Internet arenas for the last 10 years, Ballmer in July launched an ambitious reorganization focused on ""devices and services."" He announced his retirement only six weeks later amid pressure from some discontented shareholders.   Ballmer said the top layers of that reorganization had taken effect, but the new functionally organized groups were at different stages in working out exactly how they will be structured. The company had no comments on the progress of the board's search for a new CEO.   ""It really was a fundamental shift from running a set of separate business units where we tried to make connection points to running a company that is essentially one integrated entity,"" Ballmer said.   (Read more: Is Elop beinggroomed to take over top job at Microsoft?)   During four hours of presentations, which were interrupted for about half an hour due to a power cut, Microsoft executives expanded on Ballmer's idea, explaining how the company would continue its push into making its own hardware—following the deal to buy phonemaker Nokia—and would stress services rather than products, while keeping individual consumers in mind rather than chiefly concentrating on businesses.   Qi Lu, the executive in charge of applications and services, hinted that Microsoft's popular Office suite of applications would at some point be available on the iPad, a market that one analyst put at $2.5 billion a year. He said Microsoft was currently working on ""touch first"" versions—as opposed to traditional keyboard and mouse versions of core Office applications such as Outlook, Word and Excel, which would at some point feature on devices running Windows, and would be available on other platforms when they were ready and ""financially sensible.""   (Read more: Cramer: Microsoft's dividend is a move of desperation)  Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood explained that Microsoft would start reporting quarterly financial data in five new blocks based around themes rather than products such as Windows or Office. Hood said the new reporting structure—which essentially separates consumer and commercial business, and then divides revenue streams between hardware and software licensing—would begin at its next earnings in October and was aimed at giving more insight into the company's economic approach.   Ballmer closed the presentations, in Bellevue, Wash., on an optimistic note as he prepared to transition from CEO to an interested bystander who owns 4 percent of the company.   ""The company needs to produce every day. We've got a little headwind but we've got plenty of upside,"" he said. ""The ultimate measure of a place has got to be what happens with profits.

1055,2018-11-07T12:10:00-0500,"(Adds details on Washington and Nevada measures, background)Nov 7 (Reuters) - Voters in Colorado, Arizona and Washington states rejected ballot initiatives that sought to curb fossil fuels use by restricting drilling, putting a fee on carbon emissions and mandating wider use of renewable energy.The results were a setback for green activists, but a win for the energy industry and the Trump administration, which had sought to unfetter oil, gas, and coal production by rolling back environmental protections.The outcomes showed ""voters reject policies that would make energy more expensive and less reliable to them, their families, and the larger economy,"" said Thomas J. Pyle, president of free market advocacy group American Energy Alliance.While polls had indicated rising concerns among Americans over carbon emissions and water quality, the measures on the ballot in the three states to rein in fossil fuels industries were soundly rejected on U.S. Election Day on Tuesday.In Colorado, an initiative to limit new drilling near populated or vulnerable areas, which would have heavily curtailed the industry, received 43 percent of the vote, less than the majority required to pass.The Washington state measure, meanwhile, which would have imposed the nation's first fee on carbon emissions - mostly at the expense of the state's oil refiners - garnered only 44 percent of the vote.Groups defending the oil industry spent a combined $66 million to defeat the Colorado and Washington measures, with much of the contributions coming from large energy companies - including BP Plc and Marathon Oil Corp unit Andeavor.Washington state's measure, meanwhile, was supported by millions of dollars in contributions from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and an alliance of other billionaires and environmental groups.In Arizona, voters defeated a proposal backed by billionaire activist Thomas Steyer that would have required electricity providers to use renewable energy for half of their needs by 2030, up from the current 15 percent.The measure was opposed by Arizona Public Service Co , the states largest utility, which argued it would be forced to shut coal and nuclear plants, and pass along those costs to customers.A similar measure in Nevada passed, which clean energy advocates said was likely to bolster investment in the state's already fast-growing solar industry.DRILLER SHARES JUMPShares in oil producers operating in Colorado rallied on Wednesday after the state's proposed drilling restrictions failed. Anadarko Petroleum Corp gained 6.3 percent and Noble Energy Inc jumped 5.6 percent.""We think the wide margin of victory matters and that it will serve as a deterrent to those who might otherwise decide to fund another round of opposition to the industry in the next election cycle,"" Capital One Advisors wrote in a Wednesday note about the Colorado measure.Colorado's proposal would have required new oil wells to be at least 2,500 feet (762 m), five times the current minimum separation, from occupied or sensitive areas, effectively placing much of the state off-limits to new drilling.""We are proud of our thousands of volunteers who fought 'til the very end to protect their communities,"" said Russell Mendell, of anti-fracking group Colorado Rising, which backed the measure. ""We will not stop until our Colorado neighborhoods are safe from this dangerous industrial activity.""But opponents, including Colorado municipal officials, warned that the measure would have cost the state's economy billions of dollars, and would have reduced funding for roads, schools and public safety.""The oil and natural gas industry and its employees look forward to discussing concerns with reasonable people looking for reasonable solutions, said Karen Crummy, communications director for Protect Colorado, a group backed by oil companies that opposed the measure.

Notes:   Microsoft said Tuesday it will boost its dividend by 22 percent and buy back $40 billion in stock, a common move aimed at boosting the share price. So, does this mean Microsoft is healthy or sick? Using cash this way is often seen as an admission a firm can't think of anything better to do with it, like prepare the next blockbuster product.

So here's good news: half of those who expect nothing will probably get something. Unfortunately, the Great Recession wiped out $16 trillion in household net worth, so boomers are wise to be conservative in anticipating inheritances.

The key question: How many lenders will opt to operate outside the government's new ""qualified mortgage"" category, so they can lend to borrowers who otherwise couldn't be approved?

But last week, Mulally told Reuters that he was ""absolutely focused on serving our Ford.""The sources requested their identity as well as those of the investors be kept anonymous because the discussions were private.The search for a new chief executive of the world's largest software maker is one of the most closely watched developments in the technology sector this year.Microsoft remains highly profitable, but it has struggled to gain traction in the mobile device business against rivals such as Apple and Google.In July, the company unveiled a deep reorganization to transform into a ""devices and services"" leader, but has so far failed to convince investors that its strategy will work. In a sign that shareholders had already lost confidence in Ballmer, Microsoft's shares rose 7 percent after news of his planned retirement. Last week, Microsoft said it would buy Nokia's phone business and license its patents for 5.44 billion euros ($7.1 billion). Shares of the software company fell as much as 6 percent as investors protested the acquisition of an underperforming and marginalized unit that made a $3 billion operating loss in 2012.The move also brings Stephen Elop, who ran Microsoft's business software division before jumping ship in 2010, back to the company, positioned as another candidate to succeed Ballmer. Microsoft Chairman and co-founder Bill Gates, who is still the company's largest shareholder with a 4.8 percent stake and is on the four-member special committee, will likely have a veto on the new CEO choice.Gates, who has focused his day-to-day activities on philanthropy for the last five years, has not given any indication of what kind of CEO he favors.Turnaround MenInvestors are attracted to Mulally and Lawrie because both have histories of successfully turning around companies, although the Ford CEO is more widely known thanks to his dramatic reversal of the No. 2 U.S. automaker, the sources said.Under a succession plan at Ford outlined last November, Mulally, 68, is expected to stay on as CEO until at least the end of 2014. But people with knowledge of the matter said the executive may step down sooner than planned if he finds an appealing new role. ""There is no change from what we announced in November: Alan Mulally plans to continue to serve as Ford's president and CEO through at least 2014,"" Ford spokesman Jay Cooney said.A role as the head of Microsoft would allow him to follow up his seven-year tenure as Ford's CEO with another high-profile job. It would also bring him back to Seattle, where he lived during his nearly four decades at Boeing Co and still has a home.The other candidate on investors' radar is Lawrie, a long-time IT executive who engineered a complex fix at UK-based Misys Plc, a financial software company, before joining Computer Sciences in 2012.Computer Sciences, which is in the midst of a multiyear turnaround plan under Lawrie, declined to comment.Lawrie also spent nearly three decades at IBM, where he worked alongside John Thompson, Microsoft's lead independent director who is heading the special committee, the sources said.In 2005, Lawrie worked for about a year as a general partner of activist investor ValueAct Capital, a Microsoft shareholder that had pressed for Ballmer's ouster and has been offered a seat on the company's board.IBM ExperienceEven though Ballmer was more a salesman than a technology specialist, a choice of Mulally, who comes from outside the technology sector, would be a radical departure for the industry.The major precedent for such a move was IBM's successful hiring of Louis Gerstner, a manager from the financial industry who turned around the struggling computer company between 1993 and 2002. John Sculley, who went from PepsiCo to lead Apple from 1983 to 1993, was not regarded as being very successful.Despite its problems, Microsoft is not yet in such a dire predicament as IBM was in the early 1990s. Microsoft reported a profit of $22 billion last year, despite falling sales of PCs, which are still the key to its main businesses.Its online and mobile computing efforts do not make money. Its Bing search engine and other online ventures have lost almost $3 billion in the last two years alone, and last quarter the company took a $900 million write-down on the value of unsold Surface tablets.Despite billions of dollars of investment, Windows phones still have less than a 4 percent global market share, according to the latest figures from research firm IDC."

1069,2013-09-03T00:51:08-0400,"  Microsoft's $7.2 billion deal to buy Nokia's mobile phone business may be as much about hardware as it is about one man—Stephen Elop—and whether he's being groomed to take over the top job at the Redmond, Wash.-based software giant being vacated by the retiring Steve Ballmer.  The acquisition will be a homecoming for Elop, who'll be stepping down as Nokia CEO and coming back to lead Microsoft's devices group, where he once headed the business division—including the rainmaking Office suite—before he left three years ago to run Nokia. The devices division includes Windows Phone, Xbox, and the Surface tablets.(Read more: Elop on the 'burning platform')Ballmer was cagey in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday about Elop as a top contender for his job, but showered the executive with praise. ""We're glad to have Stephen come to Microsoft,"" saying Elop is the man to ""make sure that the Nokia-Microsoft acquisition goes flawlessly.""   In pre-market trading Tuesday, Nokia shares rose 45 percent on news of the deal, while Microsoft slipped five percent. There are questions, however, about whether Elop would be the right choice to ultimately succeed Ballmer, primarily because Elop presided over an 80-percent drop in Nokia stock and an inability to make any meaningful dent in the smartphone device business dominated by Samsung and  Apple.   (Flashback: Who will run Microsoft next? Not who you think)   ""Had [Elop] actually turned the business around, then that would be a different story,"" Hudson Square Research tech analyst Daniel Ernst told ""Squawk Box"" on CNBC.

""We really kicked this journey off two and a half years ago with a partnership with Nokia to do Windows phones and that partnership has yielded some very good results,"" Ballmer said on ""Worldwide Exchange.""   The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014, subject to approval by Nokia's shareholders and regulators. Besides Elop, about 32,000 Nokia employees will be joining Microsoft.   But Nokia will be retaining 60-percent of its employees, as well as its mobile broadband technology and mapping business, of which Microsoft will become a strategic licensee of the map platform. Microsoft will separately pay Nokia for a four-year license.   ""We are building a strong European technology company,"" Nokia interim president and CFO Timo Ihamuotila told CNBC. Nokia said the board had convened almost 50 times since the beginning of the year to discuss how to create shareholder value from the mobile unit.   ""We feel that this is a good transaction for Nokia shareholders,"" said Ihamuotila in a ""Squawk Box"" interview, adding that he expects ""improved earnings on the assets which will remain with Nokia.""  Nokia will also retain its patent portfolio and will grant Microsoft a 10-year license to its patents at the time of the closing.   ""It is a big surprise for the market to digest. About a year ago there was some serious discussion about whether Microsoft would buy Nokia's handset business and it didn't happen,"" Bob O'Donnell, program vice president, clients and displays at IDC in San Francisco told CNBC Asia's ""Cash Flow.""   ""To revisit that now is a huge deal. It is good for Microsoft in the sense that they control the hardware and they control the software—it's a very Apple-like strategy,"" he added.

1071,2013-09-03T14:38:48-0400,"  The acquisition of Nokia's device business by Microsoft makes sense economically, but it might not do much to help Microsoft compete with the dominant players in the smartphone market. The economic case for the merger is rather straightforward. Both Microsoft and Nokia were rapidly developing a dangerous relationship that left each of them vulnerable to mistakes and predatory behavior by the other. As the dominant seller of phones using the Microsoft operating system, Nokia was in a position to exploit Microsoft. What's more, Microsoft was vulnerable to Nokia's failures. If Nokia's devices lag behind the devices using Android or the iPhone, Microsoft would likely lose market share.The relationship wasn't great for Nokia either. It couldn't afford to become too dependent on Microsoft, for fear that Microsoft might abandon the market altogether or just produce software too inferior to attract customers. This meant that Nokia research and development work had to remain somewhat agnostic when it came to operating systems, which means that the hardware and software were unlikely to ever work as well as they do on an iPhone.The merger should go a long way to solve some of these problems. The devices can be narrowly tailored to and optimized for a Microsoft operating system. Expensive precautions against opportunistic behavior can be shed. Mutual fear of exploitation gets replaced by genuine team effort.  You'll notice that one underlying problem remains: Neither Microsoft nor Nokia have smartphone expertise. Nokia is still one of the global leaders in cell phone sales, although it's been rapidly losing share to Samsung and Apple. It has valuable connections to the operators of phone networks, a vast pool of wireless knowledge, global manufacturing facilities and a widely admired supply chain management system. None of that means that it knows very much about the future of smartphones. Nokia learned too late the importance of the kind of seamless integration of the Internet, third-party apps and mobile phones that put Apple and Samsung into such powerful positions.(Read more: Cramer says sell Nokia)Microsoft has understood that computing was going mobile forever. It's problem is different. It just never figured out how it fit into the world of mobile computing. Its core products in word processing, spread sheets, and presentations—Word, Excel, and Powerpoint—were designed for desktops. Some work well on tablets. None are things you can do very well on a phone. What's more, Microsoft's attachment to these products may be hindering it from embracing third-party software applications that would compete with them. In short, Microsoft rise to market dominance in the PC software business just did not give it much experience or knowledge useful for the world of mobile computing on smartphones. Time and again it has tried to enter the mobile business but wound up looking a lot like a PC software company trying to do mobile.(Read more: Who'll succeed Steve Ballmer at Microsoft?)It seems unlikely that putting Nokia's device knowledge with Microsoft's PC knowledge will translate into the production of smartphone excellence. The history of technological change suggests that the company dominant in one era is unlikely to achieve that position in a subsequent era.

If the company wants investors to get behind that idea, it needs to pitch the move to shareholders as something that will ultimately serve the enterprise business, she said. Even then, there's not much to get excited about, said Brendan Barnicle, a senior research analyst at Pacific Crest Securities.   ""This is a danger still for Microsoft, and I'm very skeptical if it's going to work out,"" Barnicle said. ""I think what you are really seeing is Microsoft buying a new OEM partner to keep its Windows business afloat.""   The company has a solid history of developing software, a high-margin business. But it appears as if Microsoft sees getting into devices and services—both much lower margin—as the only way to stay in software. That changes investors' view of the company, Barnicle said.    ""If that's the profile of what this company is going to look like, I think it's going to be very hard to get a lot of investors very excited,"" he said.    Another problem is the timing of the deal. Microsoft recently announced that CEO Steve Ballmer will be leaving within a year. A replacement has not been named.    (Read more: Microsoft CEO Ballmer to step down within 12 months)   ""That's the superinteresting thing about the timing of this,"" Forrest said. ""This certainly feels like it would have been something you would have left to the next person that's going to run Microsoft, and yet here we go making a major acquisition."" The stock got a big boost when news of Ballmer's departure broke over a week ago, but its share price was down more than 5 percent during afternoon trading Tuesday after reports of the Nokia agreement.  It indicates that even with Ballmer out, bad decisions will be made because the board is still in place, according to the experts.    ""Fundamentally, this is the board's call and it has been for a while,"" Barnicle said. ""It was the board's call to keep Steve there for this long, and it has been the board's call to go ahead and make this kind of deal,"" Barnicle said. ""The board has a very different view of where IT is going than I think a lot of tech investors do.""   While Microsoft has not named any CEO candidates, there has been plenty of speculation about who will be up next. With the Nokia announcement, a big contingent has the most likely candidate as Stephen Elop, a former Microsoft exec and current Nokia CEO—and what some are calling Microsoft's very own Manchurian Candidate.   (Read more: Microsoft's next CEO isn't who you think )   It's posited that Elop left his job as head of Microsoft's business division in 2010 to head up Nokia and prep the company for an eventual takeover. The theory then was that he would use that position to contract sweetheart deals for Microsoft.    While his reasons for joining Nokia remain hypothetical, there is reason to believe that his return to Microsoft will result in his replacing Ballmer, according to analysts and industry professionals.    Elop will be stepping down at Nokia when the transaction is considered for approval to avoid a conflict of interest, the company said. But the Microsoft board has said that it wants someone who understands its business, as well as devices, and Elop fits those qualifications.  ""I think you have to assume he is in the lead if you think about what the board has talked about,"" Barnicle said. But just because Elop meets those requirements doesn't mean he is the best leader for the company, he added.   ""I don't think he brings the real strategic change and innovation that you really need at Microsoft,"" Barnicle said. ""And the hopes that folks had that there might be some big restructuring that might unlock a bunch of shareholder value—you've got to assume that's off the table with this move.""   —By CNBC's Cadie Thompson.

1074,2013-08-28T11:36:12-0400,"  A stable of senior executives at Microsoft could be contenders to succeed Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, though outsiders have sparked the most discussion so far.   After Ballmer's surprise announcement Friday that he would retire within a year, the board's lead independent director, John Thompson, who heads the search for the new CEO, said the company's transformation into a fast-moving ""devices and services"" company is still on track.   (Read more: Who'll succeed Microsoft's Steve Ballmer?)   ""It does seem like if they are going to continue down the path of this devices-and-services strategy that they probably get somebody who was part of formulating this strategy or who can stand fully behind it,"" said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen. ""I don't know if most outside candidates would be willing to do that.""  He expects Microsoft to favor an internal candidate.   But insiders would face those who want a clean break from Ballmer's personal legacy, as well as other obstacles. ""The issue with internal candidates is that Microsoft has cultivated a holding-company style culture, so very few execs are broadly exposed to all areas of the business,"" said Al Hilwa, an analyst at tech research firm IDC. Here's a list of potential internal candidates, with their pros and cons, based on conversations with analysts and insiders. All except Raikes and Thompson are executive vice presidents.  Satya Nadella, cloud and enterprise PRO: A 21-year Microsoft veteran, he knows its inner workings, especially the hot areas of servers, data centers and online services. Recently promoted to run the new cloud-and-enterprise unit, he controls the infrastructure behind the services side of Microsoft's reframed vision. CON: Although he was once a vice president in the Office unit, he might struggle to impose authority over the all-powerful Windows and Office factions—the wellsprings of Microsoft's profits and famously antagonistic toward each other. Tony Bates, corporate strategy PRO: Came to Microsoft two years ago as CEO of the acquired online-chat company Skype, which represents the new wave of Internet-centric, consumer-focused technology that Microsoft has had difficulty replicating. He so impressed his new boss that Ballmer put him in charge of corporate strategy and relations with developers and PC makers.   (Read more: Microsoft 'a modest growth business': Pro) CON: May not have been at Microsoft long enough to know how to wrench it into a different shape, and his narrow specialty in the telecommunications and router field may not be broad enough to run such a large, software-based company. Terry Myerson, operating systems PRO: A young entrepreneur whose Web software company Microsoft bought in the late 1990s, he might bring a start-up mentality to the top job. Ballmer recently chose him to run the full range of operating systems (still the heart of the company ) ranging across Windows PCs, tablets, phones and the Xbox game console. CON: His last assignment was running the Windows Phone unit, which won praise for its clean, stylish software but has not come close to making Microsoft a major player in the smartphone market. Qi Lu, search and Internet PRO: The former Yahoo executive is a heavyweight in online search and advertising, with 20 U.S. patents. He now runs the applications-and-services group, which is in charge of putting the established software businesses, such as the Office suite, onto the Web. It is a crucial part of Ballmer's reorganization plan. CON: Under his stewardship, the Bing search engine has cost Microsoft billions of dollars without threatening Google's dominance. Julie Larson-Green, Xbox gaming console and Surface tablet PRO: A 20-year veteran of Microsoft and an acolyte of recently departed Windows chief Steven Sinofsky, she has intimate knowledge of the Office and Windows units, having led the redesign of both products.   (Read more: In Microsoft, young tech sees itself) CON: Is now in charge of the devices-and-studios unit, leading Microsoft's foray into making its own computers and other hardware. The Surface tablet has had poor sales, despite initial enthusiasm. She may be marked down for her close involvement with the tepidly received Windows 8. Eric Rudder, research and technology PRO: A fixture in the background at Microsoft for two decades, this deeply tech-savvy exec now runs Microsoft's long-term research unit and sets overall technical strategy. He is the nearest the company has to a big thinker in the mold of Bill Gates. CON: Never having been a business unit leader, he may not have the experience to deal with the sharp-elbowed internal politics of Microsoft to survive as CEO. Kevin Turner, COO PRO: Microsoft's chief operating officer for the past eight years, the former Wal-Mart exec is the power behind the company's fearsome sales operation. CON: A professional salesman and motivator, he does not have an engineering background, which could be a liability. Jeff Raikes, philanthropy, ex-Office chief PRO: Bill Gates, who is on the committee to choose the next CEO, picked this former leader of the Office unit to be the chief of his foundation. As Microsoft undergoes a critical transition, his long experience, understanding of Gates' thinking and steady hand might be an effective combination. CON: Immersed in the world of philanthropy for the past five years, he may be out of touch with the latest technology trends. The same generation as Ballmer, his appointment might be viewed as a continuation of the old guard. John Thompson, search committee leader PRO: It is not beyond the realm of possibility that the man leading the CEO committee may end up being considered by it. The former IBM executive went on to be CEO of computer security firm Symantec, giving him experience both of a large company reinventing itself and an understanding of the enterprise software market. CON: He joined Microsoft's board only last year and has no direct experience managing the company. His current day job is CEO of the little-known, privately held cloud-computing firm Virtual Instruments.  —By Reuters"

""This was a value stock in which people really didn't like how the company was being run, but the stock was incredibly cheap. ""And so people think that he's been a bad allocator of capital. We would probably agree with that.""   Balmer, who succeeded Bill Gates as CEO in 2000, announced that he planned to leave his post within the next 12 months, sending the stock higher.   (Read more: Microsoft CEO Ballmer to step down within 12 months) Shares of Microsoft closed at $34.75, up 7.29 percent.  On CNBC's ""Fast Money,"" Bobrinskoy said that the next chief executive of Microsoft would likely have one strong skill.   ""We think they're going to bring in somebody with capital allocation skills,"" he said. ""Think IBM. Think how well IBM has done over the last three years because they've done so well with capital allocation.""   Bobrinskoy, whose Ariel Focus Fund holds Microsoft as its largest position, chided the company for its $8 billion acquisition of Skype and called the investment in online search engine Bing ""kind of wasteful.""   The return of Bill Gates, he added, wasn't likely.  ""This is not a broken company. If this was a broken company, he might come back. But it's not that messed up,"" Bobrinskoy said.   The stock, he added, was still attractive.   ""We still think it's very cheap. There's $72 billion of cash on the books at Miscrosoft. It's less than 10 times earnings when you take away that cash,"" Bobrinskoy said.    (Read more: Who'll succeed Steve Ballmer at Microsoft?)   ""If you start allocating cash properly, this is a growth business – not 15 percrent growth but mid to high single-digits business that should be trading at 12, 13 times earnings. So, there's still a lot of room to run.""   Much of that growth, despite a tough second quarter, would come from PC growth around the world, from Microsoft's $10 billion Xbox business and cloud-computing services.

1077,2013-08-23T12:16:00-0400," Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer shocked the technology world on Friday by announcing he would step down within 12 months, punctuating a tenure marked by the software giant's declining dominance and struggles to keep pace with its competitors.   In a statement, Microsoft said Ballmer would retire ""upon the completion of a process to choose his successor. In the meantime, Ballmer will continue as CEO and will lead Microsoft through the next steps of its transformation to a devices and services company that empowers people for the activities they value most.""   Market scrutiny will now likely shift to who will be tapped to succeed Ballmer. Despite that uncertainty, investors applauded the news by sending Microsoft's shares surging by more than 7 percent — adding a whopping $24 billion to the software company's market capitalization from Thursday's close.   (Read more: Steve Ballmer's bench is empty: Who's next at the helm?)  The announcement took markets by surprise, and came only a month after the Redmond-based technology behemoth announced a broad reorganization designed to capitalize on the relentless shift toward mobile technology. Ballmer acknowledged the strategic shift, as he complemented the new leadership team.    ""There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time,"" Ballmer said in a statement.   ""My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our company's transformation to a devices and services company,"" he added. ""We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction."" A 33-year veteran of the software giant, Ballmer once oversaw Microsoft's sales and operations, and played an instrumental role in birthing the X-box, one of the company's most successful product lines.Still, Microsoft's traditional strengths in office software hit rough shoals, mirroring the dramatic slump in personal computer sales. In recent years, its suite of Windows and Microsoft Office products have taken a back seat to mobile applications that provide users with both entertainment and productivity. Sales of its Surface tablets have been comparatively meager, and the company was forced to shave the device's price in order to boost lagging sales.   Ballmer succeeded billionaire Bill Gates in 2000, the iconic wunderkind whose knack for technology innovation was rivaled only by deceased Apple CEO Steve Jobs. Much like Apple's current CEO Tim Cook, Ballmer was forced to wrestle with unfavorable comparisons to his predecessor, despite a much more flamboyant personal style that made for several viral videos.    Under Ballmer's leadership, Microsoft's stock languished and its rivals — most of whom moved rapidly to profit from the explosive growth of smartphones and tablets — began separating themselves from the rest of the technology pack. Balmer's ascension to the top suite at Microsoft coincided with the bursting of the Dotcom bubble. As a result, he presided over a 37 percent decline in the company's stock price, relegating Microsoft to among the worst performing stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index.   Ironically, Gates himself will have a hand in selecting Ballmer's successor. Microsoft said that its board would appoint a special committee to find a new chief, which will include Gates, audit committee chair Chuck Noski and compensation chairman Steve Luczo. The group ""will consider both external and internal candidates."" "
1078,2013-08-23T13:50:12-0400,"  Now that Steve Ballmer is out, there's a ton of speculation about who will be taking the helm at Microsoft. While there are plenty of names being floated as potential candidates, odds are the company's next CEO is probably not anyone you would expect.   And that, Microsoft watchers say, is precisely what the company needs: fresh blood.    (Read more: Microsoft CEO Ballmer to step down within 12 months )   ""Bill (Gates) would like the successor to be someone that he knows and someone that he is comfortable with. I don't think that person is necessarily an obvious person in the company,"" said Rick Sherlund, head of U.S. technology research at Nomura Securities, on CNBC's Squawk on the Street.   ""I do not believe there is a successor in waiting. ... Unfortunately, at Microsoft there has been enormous turnover of senior people under Ballmer, so we are left with no obvious choices here.""   But the fact that there is no obvious candidate within Microsoft may actually bode well for the company, because there are major changes needed that are only possible with someone from outside the company, analysts say.   ""CEO changes are tough when you are in a business like this. Microsoft missed the transition to tablet, missed the transition to smartphones, those problems are all still there,"" said Dan Niles, CIO of AlphaOne Capital Partners. ""The new CEO needs to be amazingly good because he is going to have his work cut out for him.""  Pushed out?   Ballmer's announcement comes just one month after the company's corporate shake-up. While Ballmer had probably hoped that the push to turn the company around would help ensure his position, shareholder activism proved that the shake-up wasn't enough and investors wanted Ballmer out, analysts said.   (Read more: Will Microsoft investors win from shake-up?)   ""This validates that the shareholder activism agenda is likely to be accomplished one way or another,"" Sherlund said.   The most notable investor who wanted Ballmer out was probably Gates, Niles said.   ""The only way Steve Ballmer is gone is because Bill Gates wants him gone, in my opinion. There's no other way this happened,"" Niles said.    Microsoft's stock surged by 7 percent after news of Ballmer leaving, adding $24 billion to the company's market capitalization from Thursday's close.    However, investors shouldn't expect the growth to last in the long-term, Niles said.    (Read more: Steve Ballmer's bench is empty: Who's next at the helm? )   ""In the near-term, the stock probably heads higher, but let's not forget this business has a lot of issues and there's a lot of precedence for replacing the CEO and still having the stock go a lot lower,"" Niles said. ""I hope they do some out-of-the-box thinking and they get somebody from outside the company. If they bring someone from inside the company, I think that's going to be a very bad decision.""  But who?   Some big names suggested as viable candidates include Steven Sinofsky, former president of the Windows Division; Scott Forstall, former senior vice president of iOS software at Apple;   and even Bill Gates. And while these are all  interesting candidates, it's unlikely any of these candidates would take the job, Milanesi said. Sinofsky had a reputation much like Forstall (difficult to work with), so it wouldn't make sense for Microsoft to bring him back, said Carolina Milanesi, a technology analyst for Gartner. As for Gates, it's unlikely he would come back to run the company since he has moved onto other projects.  ""It's not necessarily going to happen, but it would be interesting for the industry since Jobs is no longer with us. They were both seen as pillars in the industry,"" Milanesi said. ""We don't have a leader like that in the industry right now, there's a lot of good leaders, but not necessarily such a big person personality wise.""  —By CNBC's Cadie Thompson.

1079,2013-08-20T08:25:28-0400,"  A federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit accusing AOL and some of its executives of fraud for repurchasing 14.8 million shares in 2011 without disclosing that the company would sell a $1 billion portfolio of patents to Microsoft months later.   Plaintiffs in the case said they suffered significant losses when they sold their shares ahead of the patent deal, after which AOL's stock surged 43 percent in a single day.   Knowing the deal with Microsoft was imminent allowed AOL, its CEO Tim Armstrong and former CFO Arthur Minson to effectively buy their company's stock at a discount price, plaintiffs said.   But ""the complaint's conspiracy theory is mere speculation,"" U.S. District Judge Denise Cote said in an 18-page opinion.   (Read more: AOL makes $405 million bet on Internet video, ads)  The lawsuit failed to provide an adequate example in which AOL executives made a material misstatement or omission prior to the announcement of the patent sale on April 9, 2012, Cote said.   It was well known in the market that AOL's patent portfolio might be extremely valuable, Cote wrote. The company disclosed in numerous public filings that its patents were among its most valuable assets, and an activist investor in AOL, Starboard Value, had publicly speculated that the portfolio could be worth as much as $1 billion, Cote said.   The deal also came at a time in the market for such patents was heating up. Nortel, for example, sold a patent portfolio for $4.5 billion in June 2011, Cote noted.   Press reports from the time and AOL disclosures that it was working to sell the patents ""render implausible any suggestion that the public was not aware that AOL possessed an extremely valuable patent portfolio,"" Cote wrote.   (Read more: AOL chief embraces inner Trump, abruptly fires employee)   The judge also did not accept the plaintiffs' claim that an auction for the patents was essentially a sham, and that AOL knew long before April 9 that it would sell them to Microsoft, Cote said.   ""The remaining allegations in the complaint simply provide no basis for an assertion that AOL and Microsoft reached a secret deal for the sale of the patents months before the auction was conducted,"" the judge wrote.   Representatives for the plaintiffs and AOL were not immediately available for comment. The lead plaintiff is Barbara Keeling, who the complaint said sold AOL stock during the class period and before the deal.

His top pick is T-Mobile CEO John Legere.   Legere, a former executive at Dell and AT&amp;T, is experiencing ""incredible performance,"" Sonnenfeld said on CNBC's ""Fast Money."" ""John Legere knows every part of this business. His ad rates are soaring. At T-Mobile, the usage is up dramatically,"" he said. ""And he actually really knows the device business.

""Let's think of those new-new thing companies,"" he said.

""This is not at all surprising."" Daniel Gleeson, a mobile analyst at IHS Electronics and Media told CNBC. ""The Blackberry brand is very much in decline even in emerging markets like Indonesia and Colombia where it found significant success over the past couple (of) years. Blackberry has simply fallen several steps behind its rivals as the new Blackberry 10 OS was released much later than iOS, Android or even Windows Phone.""    Blackberry's key selling point is a rigid messaging system called BBM but many alternatives are now available such as WhatsApp, Viber and WeChat, according to Gleeson. He predicted that Blackberry will shrink back to being a niche player used only in the business world.   (Read More: BlackBerry shares soar as company explores 'strategic alternatives')  Showing similarities to Blackberry, Microsoft Windows Mobile devices ruled the roost in 2006 in the PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) sector before the rise of the smartphone. It enjoyed more than 50 percent of market share when measured against other operating systems, according to Gartner, but fell into steady decline with the emergence of Android and iOS.   Microsoft remains a long, long way behind Apple and Android, according to Neil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics. Microsoft's leadership over Blackberry can only be considered a minor battle in a much bigger smartphone war that Microsoft is fighting, he told CNBC.   And that battle is being fought hand-in-hand with Finnish mobile maker Nokia, which uses the operating software for its range of Lumia smartphones. Nokia's Lumia sales grew 112.7 percent in the second quarter of 2013, Gartner said, thanks to its expanded Lumia portfolio which now includes Lumia 520 and Lumia 720 devices. With the recent announcement of the Lumia 10 it expects sales to be boosted further in the second half of the year, which will surely offer further support for the American multinational.   (Read More: Microsoft losing money on Surface tablets)  The Windows phone is a much more mature platform, Gleeson told CNBC. With devices such as the Nokia Lumia 520 it is able to produce a modern smartphone at prices Blackberry simply cannot match, he said.   ""Windows Phone however is yet to gain significant traction in the U.S. market. This will be an impediment to its overall growth as many app developers are based in the U.S. and develop primarily for the U.S. market. Despite being available for nearly three years, Windows Phone still lacks some important apps such as Instagram. Without a breakthrough in the U.S., IHS forecasts that Windows Phone will remain a distant third place to iOS and Android,"" Gleeson told CNBC.  By CNBC.com's Matt Clinch.

1083,2013-08-15T12:59:53-0400,"Strategies for video game console are typically planned years in advance, but the course has been anything but clear for the Xbox One. In the months since Microsoft introduced the next-generation system, the company has made four major policy reversals—and there's no telling if it's done yet.    At stake is Microsoft's leadership position in the $70 billion video game industry. For the past 30 months, the Xbox 360 has topped console hardware sales, but Sony's PlayStation 4 is resonating with gamers as the next generation looms. And investors are trying to determine whether the Xbox team is scrambling to catch up or is simply showing a willingness to preemptively respond to market feedback.    The series of 180 turns started in June, when Microsoft  went back on its ""always-on"" Internet and used-game policies (after vigorously defending them the previous week at the E3 trade show). In July, the company announced plans to let independent game makers self-publish titles on Xbox One after initially saying it would not allow that.  (Read more: Game's $1 million edition to send you into space (for real))   Earlier this month, Microsoft slid on earlier claims that the system would ship without a bundled chat headset. And this week it said that the Kinect sensor, which enabled audible and gesture commands, will not have to be plugged into the Xbox One for the console to operate after all. In May, it had virtually declared that the heart of the system. The company has cited ""feedback from the Xbox community"" for most of the changes, but Sony deserves some of the credit, too. The company has been needling the Xbox One since E3, with a sharp eye on the issues that consumers have complained about.   ""Moves like these are kind of unprecedented—especially from Microsoft,"" said John Taylor, managing director of Arcadia Investment. ""My guess is when they unveiled the [Xbox One] in late May, it was their hope and belief that people would be impressed enough with the features it offered that there would not be a ton of pushback. I think Sony has played the PR game masterfully. Much of this comes from the direct response from Sony at E3 and subsequently.""  (Read more: 'Fruit Ninja' CEO on making games that are a cut above)   Microsoft did not respond to a request for comment, but analysts note that the policy changes indicate that it is being extra cautious about ensuring that the Xbox One has a successful launch—something that's critical, as the product has been classified as the company's most important for the next decade.    ""They can't afford to whiff on this launch,"" said P.J. McNealy, founder of Digital World Research. ""This holiday season and ... 2014 are critical for the next 10 years of the business. They clearly had some early missteps, but the good news is they haven't launched yet, so things can still be corrected. It has been, by no means, an ideal past few months for them, though.""   The Xbox One shifts come amid several other disruptions at Microsoft. Its stock has been relatively flat this year. Activist investor ValueAct Capital took a $2 billion stake in April, and an executive reshuffling saw the departure of the head of the Interactive Entertainment division, which oversees Xbox.    So what happened? Did Microsoft, in its initial planning, severely misjudge what the public wants in a next-generation gaming system?    Industry observers say no, adding that the Xbox One may be more forward-looking than its competitors. Some of the features Microsoft touted don't seem necessary or especially beneficial today, however, which may have confused a number of potential buyers.    In the short term, Microsoft want to create the perception of fanatical demand for the Xbox One, which will hit shelves this holiday for $499—and avoid any comparisons with Nintendo's Wii U, which has languished on store shelves since its introduction last year. Just as important, it doesn't want to cede its leadership position to Sony as the new generation begins. Analysts say the changes should help with that.    (Read more: Gaming legend joins hot virtual reality start-up)  ""We are confident that with six months of focused messaging, Microsoft can fully level the playing field with Sony, and we expect the Xbox One to sell as many units as the PS4,"" said Wedbush's Michael Pachter after the first policy changes.   The revisions don't cost the company any money at this point, and by making them in the pre-launch period, there's a better chance that gamers will have forgotten them once the Xbox One is available.    ""My sense is that this is one [Microsoft] division showing some flexibility and demonstrating that they are listening to what the market is saying in terms of feedback,"" Taylor said. ""Not a lot of big companies typically do that.""  —By Chris Morris, Special to CNBC.com "

More than 80,000 September 33 calls traded yesterday, most of them bought for the ask prices in a strongly bullish pattern halfway through the session, according to OptionMonster's real-time tracking systems. The first big blocks priced for $0.19 and $0.21 within 20 minutes and were followed by another chunk for $0.30 a couple of hours later.These calls lock in the price where investors can buy stock in the software giant no matter how far it might rise. Given how little the options cost compared to the stock itself, they could generate significant leverage in a rally.   Microsoft rose 1.52 percent to $32.66 yesterday, coming back from its intraday low after the options began to pop. The stock gapped down from above $35 on July 19 after the company reported weak quarterly results and lowered guidance. It also took a $900 million charge for its faltering Surface tablets.    Total option volume in the name was almost triple its daily average for the last month. Overall calls outpaced puts by more than 5 to 1, a further indication of the session's bullish sentiment.     —By CNBC Contributor David Russell  Additional news: Microsoft,Google disappoint; shares pay the price  Additional views: Microsoftearnings a 'comedy of errors': Analyst    ___________________________ Options Trading School:   Options Terminology: Glossary   Basic Strategies—With Examples   Options Basics: The ABCs    ___________________________ Disclosures:  Mike Yamamoto is managing editor for OptionMonster.

1085,2013-07-31T10:14:13-0400," Microsoft's Surface tablets have yet to make any profit, as sputtering sales have been eclipsed by advertising costs and an accounting charge, according to the software company's annual report.   The two tablet models, introduced in October and February to challenge Apple's popular iPad, have so far brought in revenue of $853 million, Microsoft revealed for the first time in its annual report filed with regulators on Tuesday.  That is less than the $900 million charge Microsoft announced earlier this month to write down the value of unsold Surface RT —the tablet's first model—still on its hands.   On top of that, Microsoft said its sales and marketing expenses increased $1.4 billion, or 10 percent, because of the huge advertising campaigns for Windows 8 and Surface. It also identified Surface as one of the reasons its overall production costs rose.   The Surface is Microsoft's first foray into making its own computers after years of focusing on software, but its first attempts have not won over consumers. By comparison, Apple sold almost $24 billion worth of iPads over the last three quarters.  —By Reuters.  "

1088,2013-07-18T16:46:33-0400,"  Tech giants Google and Microsoft tumbled in after-hours trading after both companies missed Wall Street forecasts for the second quarter.    Weakness in both stocks weighed on the broader indices after-hours. The Powershares QQQ ETF is off nearly 1 percent and S&amp;P futures are weakening.     Google reported second-quarter adjusted earnings of $9.56 a share versus Wall Street estimates of $10.78 a share. Revenue of $14.11 billion missed forecasts for $14.41 billion.    Average cost-per-click, which measures how much an advertiser pays when users click on ads, fell 6 percent from the year-ago quarter, after falling 4 percent in the first quarter.      Paid clicks, which measures how often users click on Google ads, rose about 23 percent over the second quarter of last year, but were up only 4 percent sequentially.    In the year-earlier quarter, Google earned $10.12 a share on revenue of $9.61 billion.  While Google's advertising business continues to grow with revenue for its core business increasing  20 percent to, its operating expenses rose to $4.92 billion in the quarter from $3.89 billion a year earlier. Traffic acquisition costs totaled $3.01 billion, or 25 percent of advertising revenues.   Meanwhile, Microsoft missed forecasts as the downturn in the PC business hit sales and it took a $900 million charge for its inventory of unsold Surface tablets.    Microsoft report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings excluding items of 66 cents a share for the fiscal fourth quarter on $19.9 billion revenue.    Analysts had expected the company to report earnings excluding items of 75 cents a share on $20.73 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.   While PCs remained challenged, Microsoft's business division recorded a 14 percent rise in sales and its server and tool revenue climbed 9 percent in the quarter.    Microsoft also revised its operating expense guidance downward to $31.3 billion to $31.9 billion for its current fiscal year.  "
1089,2013-07-17T13:30:31-0400,"  Thursday is a big earnings day for the tech sector: Both Microsoft and Google report their quarterly numbers after the closing bell.    Microsoft is expected to report a 15 percent increase in revenue to $20.74 billion, on a 12 percent rise in earnings per share, to 75 cents, according to Thomson One Analytics.   But the company faces some big challenges—namely the industrywide decline in PC sales—plus some big questions about the impact of its recent restructuring. Investors will be eager to hear about how well Surface tablets are selling and what to expect from the upcoming Xbox One launch.   ""Although the PC market continues to search for a bottom, we believe Microsoft's enterprise-business continues to perform well and should enable it to roughly meet our estimates,"" said Stifel analyst Brad Reback, who has a ""buy"" rating on the stock.    ""While we expect the quarter to be relatively noneventful, we note that similar to the past few quarters there could be some noise in the results (i.e., ~$780 million in Office deferrals recognized, potential inventory write-down, etc.), and given the recent run in the shares we would not be shocked if the shares take a near-term breather."" (Read more: Tech earnings preview: IBM, Intel and eBay)  Wells Fargo analyst Jason Maynard focused in on the impact of the recent reorganization and a having a new CFO in place, writing ""we think that Fiscal Q1 guidance will likely be conservative and in line with current expectations.""    Janney analyst Yun Kim warned that the reorganization could ""potentially introduce a lower level of transparency,"" noting that Microsoft may not issue the fiscal year outlook for each of the business segments as it usually does.  But Kim is bullish on the impact of Surface. ""We believe incremental revenue from its Surface business can more than offset the continued double-digit unit decline in the global PC market the company faced in the quarter.""   Google's revenue is expected to shoot 50 percent higher than a year ago to $14.42 billion on 7 percent higher earnings per share of 11 cents. Though Google has made high-profile acquisitions, like Waze, to bolster its maps business, and has made a big push behind other services including Music and YouTube, the focus of its earnings will be on its core business—search.    And as consumers shift their time away from the desktop to mobile devices, investors are curious to hear about Google's mobile search revenue growth in particular.    Pivotal Research Group's Brian Wieser warned that Google's diversification will dilute margins: ""We believe that newer sources of revenues such as online display advertising, YouTube, Google Fiber, consumer electronics and others are or will be lower margin, and paired with the ongoing need to pay distribution partners fees related to enabling their search engine as a default tool on mobile devices, expect compression to continue going forward.""  Raymond James analyst Aaron Kessler wrote that one of his questions is about Google's traffic acquisition costs, after ""mixed trends in the first quarter."" He's also concerned about margin stabilization.    (Read more: As earnings take over, fundamentals to be tested)   With Google's Motorola preparing to launch its new Moto X Smartphone, analysts will surely ask how much Google will invest in marketing.    ""The unit is reportedly set to spend $500 million marketing the new Moto X phone later this year, a notable figure considering that would account for almost four times the unit's entire sales and marketing budget recorded during 1Q13,"" wrote Pivotal's Wieser. Some reports put the number as high as $500 million.    The bigger question is: What can investors expect from mobile hardware growth, and what'll it cost?    And of course investors will be looking for any guidance for the rest of the year. Bank of America Merrill Lynch's Justin Post is bullish, with a ""buy"" rating and a $975 price tag. He wrote that he upgraded Google in the first quarter on anticipation of catalysts in the second half of the year, and continues to expect a lot of Google in the next five months.

While Microsoft's share price is up about 30 percent from a year ago and the company's enterprise business cloud has done well, the company has continued to struggle against competitors like Apple in consumer products.

1093,2013-07-11T09:36:41-0400,"  Software giant Microsoft announced a long-awaited restructuring on Thursday, organizing itself around key areas designed to make the company more nimble in the face of  fierce competition in the technology sector.   As part of the reorganization, Microsoft announced the president of its Microsoft Office division, Kurt DelBene, will be retiring. Early media reports suggested that many in the executive suite were nervous about the impending change.  The company's move comes as traditional computers are increasingly taking a backseat to mobile devices, and the applications that support them. Sales of personal computers — Microsoft's traditional strength for products like Windows and Office — have slumped to historical lows in the broad move toward gadgets that enhance productivity and provide entertainment.As consumers migrate to tablets and smartphones, Microsoft has struggled to keep pace with the other top dogs in the technology sector like Google and Apple, and lacks a coherent mobile strategy. Google's Android software — run on Samsung's wildly popular Galaxy phones — and Apple's iOS for iPhone take up an estimated 92 percent of the market. That has left little room for Microsoft's Windows smartphone to chip away at their dominance.   Microsoft's restructuring centers around beefing up strategy dedicated primarily to operating systems, applications, cloud computing and devices. According to a communique, the new reorganization gives Microsoft's advertising, marketing and media apparatus more authority.As part of its push into the brave new world of mobile, the company named Julie Larson-Green as head of devices and studios engineering group, overseeing areas such as hardware development, games, music and entertainment. Terry Myerson will head up Microsoft's operating systems and engineering group, which includes Windows.  The reorganization process is expected to be completed by the end of the calendar year as Microsoft aims to ""figure things out,"" the company said.

1096,2013-07-12T09:58:02-0400,"Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt is all fired up about Motorola's launch of the Moto X smartphone, which he enthusiastically showed off during an interview at Sun Valley by using it to snap pictures of our camera set-up.""The new products are state-of-the-art on a level that's indescribably good,"" Schmidt told CNBC. ""I really like them personally. The company uses them internally. Much faster and better integrated. We've very excited about this. Watch this space.""Schmidt was joined at Sun Valley by two newcomers to the event, Nikesh Arora, Google's senior vice president and chief business officer, and Salar Kamangar, CEO of YouTube and senior vice president of video at Google. CEO Larry Page, who recently disclosed a chronic illness that affects his vocal cords and breathing, was absent.   Despite Schmidt's enthusiasm, Motorola is fighting an uphill battle against Samsung and Apple. But Schmidt smiled and said ""winners in one generation may not be in another generation.""   ""If you told me five years ago Samsung would be the number one smartphone vendor in Android and beaten Apple, I'd say probably not possible, and yet it's true today,"" he said. ""It shows you that innovation is very much alive and well.""   (Read More: Motorola Ad Teases Buyer-Customizable Moto X)    Schmidt also spoke about the innovation happening around the power of the cloud. ""It's not just the cloud. It's the cloud and these devices, that are personal, very powerful, a new set of apps that make life better, help you, give you guidance—all with your permission of course.""  While Schmidt was wary of commenting directly on Microsoft's reorganization, announced Thursday, he said the changes reflect and industry-wide shift.    ""Every company is responding to the new architecture of cloud computing. We're having great success with Google apps and docs in enterprise and Microsoft must be responding to that in some way,"" Schmidt said.   (Read More: Microsoft Shake-Up: Will Investors Win?)   As to rising competition from Facebook, Yahoo and Twitter, as they improve their ad options, Schmidt said: ""The funny thing about advertising is that it's not a zero-sum game. ... Historically, in the digital ad world, pie has gotten larger and it's possible for everyone to win, and it's perfectly possible that will continue to be true for quite some time.""   Schmidt was eager to vent his frustrations about the immigration bill stalling on Capitol Hill. ""The policy of America to deny visas to technically trained people in the U.S. and shipped to other countries, where they create companies that compete with America, has to be the stupidest policy of all the U.S. government policies,"" Schmidt said. ""It's being held hostage by all these other issues.""   (Read More: Why Silicon Valley Wants Immigration Reform)   The other topic Schmidt vented about was the National Security Agency's Prism controversy.    ""We were upset because there was a statement made that somehow the NSA had special access inside Google, which was false,"" Schmidt said. ""We clearly stated that's not the case.""    ""We've also been upset as a company that we're not allowed to talk in details about the nature of such requests [because of the Patriot Act],"" he said. ""If allowed to do that, people would have a much better understanding if that's appropriate or not.""  —By CNBC's Julia Boorstin. Follow her on Twitter: @JBoorstin. "

1098,2013-07-09T08:16:00-0400,"A long-heralded shake-up at Microsoft is expected to unfurl this week, perhaps Thursday, at the urging of CEO Steve Ballmer, AllThingsD is reporting, citing unnamed company sources.The site described the roll-out's plans as fluid, given ""close-to-the-vest planning by Ballmer"" and angst among senior executives. Yet one thing appears clear: Microsoft is expected to reorient the company around services—or software—and devices in its consumer and business segments. According to AllThingsD, the effort is designed to create ""functional coherence"" at the company, which is suffering something of an identity crisis in the fiercely competitive technology sector.

Such initiatives such as leveraging the company's $66 billion in cash offshore could be presented, he added, with an argument such as, ""Let's borrow against it.

1101,2013-07-01T16:24:07-0400,"Games publisher Zynga will replace chief executive Mark Pincus with Microsoft executive Don Mattrick, who heads Microsoft's critical Xbox business, Zynga announced on Monday.  In a note to Zynga employees, Mattrick said he is ""excited"" to join the company.  Pincus, 47, who controls a 61 percent voting stake in the gaming company he founded in 2007, will remain chairman.    Zynga's business model, which relied heavily on selling virtual goods to gamers on Facebook's platform, began to disintegrate a year ago as users tired of Facebook games. Pincus has been unable to turn around the company named after his pet bulldog, Zinga.   The company's shares have hovered at just 25 percent of its $10 price at the company's initial offering price in December 2011.   Mattrick joined Microsoft in 2007 after spending years at Electronic Arts. He helped turn the Xbox business into a profitable venture after years of losses, eventually propelling it into the No.1 selling console in the United States.  Mattrick's departure comes just as Microsoft gears up to launch the third version of its console, called the Xbox One. Unveiled in May and scheduled to hit stores later this year, the machine has already stirred up controversy.   Gamers attacked the high price tag, Microsoft's plan to require an Internet connection at least once a day and moves to limit sharing of used games. Last month, Microsoft reversed its position on the Internet connection and said it would allow game sharing.   Mattrick joins a game maker that publishes social media-based titles and low production-value smartphone games — a departure from the world of big-budget, traditional packaged games embodied by the Xbox.   Mattrick had been rumored to depart for months. After EA's CEO stepped down in March, industry sources have speculated that he was in the running to lead the top games publisher, where he previously held numerous leadership roles. "
1102,2013-06-26T16:29:28-0400," Microsoft gave people a peek into Windows 8.1—a free update that promises to address some of the gripes people have with the latest version of the company's flagship operating system—at Microsoft Build 2013. What's the stock doing now? Click here for the latest quote.  The three-day Build conference, which started Wednesday in San Francisco, gave Microsoft developers a chance to learn more about the new system and try it out. It also gives the company a chance to explain some of the reasoning behind the update and sell developers on Microsoft's ambitions to regain relevance lost to Apple's iPad and various devices running Google's Android software.   Although the preview version of Windows 8.1 was meant for Microsoft's partners and other technology developers, everyone is able to download it for free starting Wednesday, exactly eight months since desktops, laptops and tablets with Windows 8 went on sale. The version of the Windows 8.1 update meant for the general public will come out later in the year, though a specific date hasn't been announced.   The big news came from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer in his keynote address: The return of the ""start"" button! This was one of users' biggest gripes about Windows 8.    Ballmer said the update was a bit of a mea culpa that they ""pushed too boldly with Windows 8.""   One caveat: The ""start"" button won't launch the same pop-up menu as it used to, instead it takes users to the new start screen and users can right-click to get to the control panel, task manager, search and other items, as well as to shut down or restart the computer. (In Windows 8, restart and shutdown were hidden in a drop-down in the top right corner.) (Read More: Microsoft and Oracle Join Forces Against Smaller Rivals)  Windows 8, which was released Oct. 26, was meant to be Microsoft's answer to changing customer behaviors and the rise of tablet computers. The operating system emphasizes touch controls over the mouse and the keyboard, which had been the main way people have interacted with their personal computers since the 1980s.   And while Microsoft has encouraged people to use the new tablet-style layout, many programs—including Microsoft's latest Office software package—are designed for the older, desktop mode. People were forced into the tablet layout when they start up the machine and had to manually switch the desktop mode each time.   With the update, users will also be able to boot directly to their desktop.   ""We designed Windows 8.1 to feel natural on everything from small tablets all the way to desktop workstations,"" said Julie Larson-Green, Microsoft's corporate vice president for Windows.   Microsoft also tweaked the start screen so users can see many apps at a glance. People will get more options to determine how much of the screen each app takes while showing up to four different programs, rather than just two. The update will also offer more integrated search results, showing users previews of websites, apps and documents that are on the device, all at once.Although Microsoft has said it has sold more than 100 million Windows 8 licenses so far, some analysts have blamed the lackluster response to the operating system for a steep drop in PC sales in the first three months of the year, the worst drop since tracking by outside research firms began in 1994.(Read More: Nokia andMicrosoft: The Tables Have Turned)  It's crucial that Microsoft sets things right with Windows 8.1 because the outlook for the PC market keeps getting gloomier. IDC now expects PC shipments to fall by nearly 8 percent this year, worse than its previous forecast of a 1 percent dip. IDC also anticipates tablets will outsell laptop computers for the first time this year.   Microsoft is positioning the update as more than just a fix-up job. From its perspective, the tune-up underscores Microsoft's evolution into a more nimble company capable of moving quickly to respond to customer feedback while also rolling out more innovations for a myriad of Windows devices—smartphones, tablets or PCs.   In his keynote address, Ballmer said the one thing he was most excited about was the ""rapid pace of innovation"" and that the company was going through a transformation from a traditional software company to a ""rapid release"" company that builds software-powered devices and services.   (Read More: MicrosoftRestructuring Nears, Top Execs Freak: Report)   Microsoft executives also demonstrated Project Spark, a simulator unveiled at the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles this month. It invites gamers to craft virtual worlds with the swipe of a finger, and then play through them on the Xbox One.   Ballmer used that as an example of what a new world of apps can look like — whether it's productivity in the office or hard-core fun with gaming. He says Microsoft is trying to facilitate all that by releasing updates rapidly.   Ballmer said more apps are coming for Windows tablets, including Facebook and a fantasy football app from the NFL.   Microsoft also unveiled new capabilities with its Bing search technology, including better maps. The Windows 8.1 maps app will come with 3-D imagery, which developers can embed in their own apps.   Windows 8.1 will update apps automatically, and the Bing search engine will recommend new ones for you based on what you've used before.    Windows 8.1 also supports 3-D printing. On stage, Antoine Leblond, corporate vice president of the Windows web-services team, started printing a vase using a MakerBot device.   Correction:  Microsoft did not announce a smaller version of its Surface tablet computer, as had been expected. "
1103,2013-11-13T17:08:49-0500," Microsoft is getting rid of a controversial employee ranking system hoping to encourage the development of more products consumers want, according to the company.   ""These changes will encourage greater speed, creativity and teamwork to help us bring innovation to market faster and better serve our customers,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC.   The nixed system, which evaluated employees on a curve, identified the top performers, the lowest performers and the employees that fall into the middle of that spectrum. In some cases, the worst performers could be fired, and the fear of falling into that could hurt company morale and potentially pit employees against each other.   ""It's really important, I think, to judge on a curve to know who your top performers are, but on the other hand I think it could wind up making a lot employees devalued and that's really not a good thing when you're trying to foster a culture of innovation,"" said Mark Spoonauer, editor-in-chief of Laptopmag.com however.    If the ranking system is implemented correctly, employees who could use some improvement would know who they are and how to improve, Spoonauer said.    ""It's the execution of this that's key. Being transparent without fostering a culture of fear,"" he added. —By CNBC's Althea Chang. "
1104,2013-06-25T08:59:55-0400," Microsoft will offer its popular ""Age of Empires"" game for Apple's iPhone and other smartphones through a tie-up with Japan's KLab, seeking to capture growth in a booming mobile game market.   Microsoft's gaming business is dependent primarily on its Xbox franchise but mobile devices have been eating into the gaming industry, luring consumers away from traditional consoles.   While the tech giant has released a few mobile games for iOS and Android like Wordament, ""Age of Empires"" is its most popular game to date to be offered beyond its own consoles.

1105,2013-06-24T17:20:58-0400," Microsoft and Oracle on Monday announced a tie-up to give the once-fierce rivals an advantage against newer, Web-based cloud computing companies chipping away at their businesses. The two industry leaders have vied with one another for decades to sell technology to the world's largest companies. But they face growing pressure from more-nimble competitors selling often-cheaper services based in remote data centers, and they are moving to adapt.  Under the agreement, customers will be able to run Oracle software on Microsoft's Server Hyper-V and on Windows Azure platforms, the companies said. Microsoft will offer Oracle's Java, Database and WebLogic Server to Azure customers, and Oracle will make its Linux available to Azure customers, the companies said in a news release. No. 3 software maker Oracle missed expectations for software sales for the fourth quarter, sending its shares plunging last week. Investors worried that the company may have trouble competing with providers such as Salesforce.com and Workday, as well as Amazon.com, which has also become a major player in cloud-computing infrastructure.  Top software maker Microsoft has a large-scale cloud-computing initiative, Azure, that has failed to catch up with Amazon's AWS (Amazon Web Services).  "

1108,2013-06-19T18:13:12-0400,"  Less than one week after E3, Microsoft has announced a major policy change on the most controversial policies of the Xbox One, bowing to growing negative consumer sentiment.    In a stunning reversal, the company announced that the system would no longer require an Internet connection to play offline games (beyond an initial period when users first set up their system), dropped all restrictions on trading and loaning games to friends and did away with region-locking restrictions.    Citing ""feedback from the Xbox community,"" Microsoft unveiled the changes late Wednesday.    ""We appreciate your passion, support and willingness to challenge the assumptions of digital licensing and connectivity,"" said Don Mattrick, president of Microsoft's Interactive Entertainment Business in an open letter to gamers. ""While we believe that the majority of people will play games online and access the cloud for both games and entertainment, we will give consumers the choice of both physical and digital content. We have listened and we have heard loud and clear from your feedback that you want the best of both worlds.""   Analysts quickly cheered the move.    ""This is the fastest Microsoft has reacted to anything in quite some time,"" said P.J. McNealy of Digital World Research. ""It's a credit to them but it also underscores how critically important this launch is for Microsoft as a company. This is the largest hardware product launch at Microsoft for the last 10 years and it sets up the next 10 years.""   (Read More: Tech Deal: Microsoft to Open Stores-Within-Stores at Best Buy)   Microsoft had previously announced it would require Xbox One users to check in online every 24 hours or games would cease to function—even in single-player modes. The company also noted today that downloaded games would be playable offline—a key concession, given the growing emphasis on online distribution in the next generation.    With the announcement, Microsoft hopes to nullify some of the damage the company did to its reputation with gamers at E3 and the weeks leading up to it. Sony undercut the Xbox One's price by $100 at E3, but the real reaction was for its clearly stated policies on used games (which would work the same way they do this generation) and mandatory Internet connectivity (there was none).    During the show, Amazon polled customers to see which next-gen console they planned on preordering. The results were staggering, with the PS4 outperforming the Xbox One 18 to 1—garnering 94 percent of the vote before the poll was taken down.    (Read More: E3's Winner: Xbox vs. PlayStation)   The news is also a potential big boost for GameStop, whose stock has suffered as investors worried about the fate of its used-game business. In its most recent fiscal quarter, 28 percent of the company's overall sales were from used video game products—bringing in $496.3 million. Used games represented more than 48 percent of GameStop's gross profits.    GameStop shares were up more than 6 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday.   The announcement could also benefit third-party publishers, including Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Activision-Blizzard and Take-Two Interactive Software. Not only does it make the Xbox One a better bet at retail, increasing the potential reach for their titles, it relieves them of having to decide individual policies on used games. (Previously, publishers would have been able to block used games on the system).    ""It was clear after E3 that [Microsoft] had to react, and reacting now is a heck of a lot better than reacting in September,"" said McNealy. ""They were getting killed on the PR front by Sony, and this allows them, from their perspective, to put the issues to rest.""   By changing stance on its controversial digital-rights-management stances, Microsoft can now focus on arguing the value proposition of its higher price. Before this, that argument would have been obfuscated by the controversial policies, says McNealy.    ""It isn't just about price, it's about value,"" said Yusuf Mehdi, vice president of marketing and strategy for the Xbox division at E3 last week. ""We believe we have incredible value for the price we're offering our system. And I think it's unmatched compared to other things.""   While the $100 price difference is still a hurdle that must be cleared, both publishers and analysts say it will be much easier to accomplish that now that Microsoft has bowed to public pressure on its most controversial practices.    And with nearly six months remaining before the new systems launch, there's still time for Microsoft to either bundle games with its system or secure subsidies from partners that would allow it to lower the Xbox One's price.   ""We're just putting our shoes on to get to the start line of a long-distance race,"" says Peter Moore, chief operating officer of EA. ""I think you're going to see creative pricing models that would let the consumer, in their mind, make a commitment."""
1109,2013-06-13T12:19:30-0400,"  Best Buy is partnering with Microsoft to feature a store-within-a-store for Windows products. The locations, which begin opening this month, will offer Windows-based PCs, tablets, Xbox and accessories, as well as trained staff to answer customer questions about Windows 8. The move comes as the Minneapolis-based retailer, along with others, battles the ""showrooming"" effect: people browsing stores, and then buying the items at a lower price online. The trend has led to concerns that the big-box format could become obsolete. But major electronics retailers are finding benefits in having physical destinations where professionals can assist shoppers. Best Buy has similar store-within-stores for Apple, Samsung and Magnolia products. Belus Capital Markets analyst Brian Sozzi said that the move ""absolutely makes sense"" and that expects Best Buy to offer more along these lines. ""The fact is Best Buy has prime floor space up for grabs, and tech companies want their best offerings in there (along with the customer service), instead of buried on Amazon,"" he said in a note to clients.The chance for demonstration is a particular advantage for Microsoft, whose Windows 8 line has had slow sales. Its tile format represents a complete break with over two decades of Windows products and offers few signals about where to tap and click to perform basic functions. More than 1,200 Microsoft-trained workers will staff the kiosks. ""The Windows Store offers a large-scale, hands-on customer experience,"" that provides insight and information about Windows and Microsoft devices and services, said Tami Reller, CFO and chief marketing officer for Windows. The move is a ""vital strategic step forward"" in Microsoft's retail strategy, Forrester analyst JP Gownder wrote in an online post. It isn't as ambitious a move as if Microsoft had opened more of its own stores, he said, though that would have been more expensive. Windows has more than 70 retail stores in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico.The store rollout in 500 Best Buys in the U.S. and 100 in Canada should be complete by September.  A similar Windows store will be available at Bestbuy.com, with updates on locations and deals.Best Buy shares rose 18 cents to $27.06 in midday trading Thursday. Microsoft shares slipped 32 cents to $34.68."

The commitment, announced Tuesday, has the backing of the five largest U.S. cellular carriers as well as the key players in the smartphone device and operating system markets, a list that includes Apple, Google, HTC, Huawei, Motorola, Microsoft, Nokia and Samsung.   Those signing the pledge agree that devices going on sale after July 2015 will have the ability to remotely wipe data and be rendered inoperable, if the user chooses, to prevent the device from being reactivated without the owner's permission. Lost or stolen devices could later be restored if recovered. The carriers also agreed they would facilitate these measures.   Re/code has the story.   —By Ina Fried, Re/code.net.

1111,2018-11-30T08:04:19-0500,"Amazon Web Services is competing with two more customers, Algorithmia and Confluent.In the past, Amazon announced products that competed with customers like Dropbox and Elastic.AWS revenue grew 46 percent in the third quarter.At its annual customer conference in Las Vegas this week, Amazon's cloud business, Amazon Web Services, announced several new products. A few of them compete directly with smaller companies that already offer similar products running on Amazon's cloud.AWS is the world's biggest public cloud, generating $6.68 billion in revenue for Amazon in the third quarter, up 46 percent year over year. But as Amazon expands into countless new areas, from grocery stores to health care, some companies that have previously worked with Amazon have found a partner becoming the competition overnight.Retailers that sell products to consumers have recognized Amazon's expanding role. While some continue to use Amazon as a cloud provider, others, like Gap and Walmart, have opted to standardize on clouds from other companies, like Microsoft and Google.Similarly, software providers could start to consider alternatives as Amazon's cloud business continues to widen its product lineup, even if AWS is the clear market leader.On Thursday, Amazon's chief technology officer, Werner Vogels, announced the launch of a tool for running clusters of the Apache Kafka open-source software for processing data.Kafka was originally developed inside LinkedIn, and its creators formed a start-up called Confluent that spun out of LinkedIn in 2014. Today, Confluent fields a cloud-managed version of Kafka that can be run on Amazon's cloud, or in other clouds and even in on-premises data centers.Confluent's product is designed to be easier for people to use than the open-source project that developers would have to set up and manage computing and data storage infrastructure on their own. For years, AWS has suggested that developers interested in Kafka use its proprietary product called Kinesis, but AWS now has a product specifically with Kafka in mind. It goes by the name Amazon Managed Streaming for Kafka.""People basically want the real thing, so in that sense, it's good for the open-source companies,"" Jay Kreps, a creator of Kafka and co-founder and CEO of Confluent, told CNBC on Thursday. ""This is obviously hard, because it's kind of a dual thing. Rather than collaborate with the company and kind of build the ecosystem of those offerings in their cloud, they obviously want to do it themselves.""What's more, Kreps said, Amazon has not contributed a single line of code to the Apache Kafka open-source software and is not reselling Confluent's cloud tool.""They're profiting from our use of resources,"" Kreps said. ""We're charging our customers for the service, paying for compute and network resources that we use.""Also this week, AWS introduced a marketplace for artificial intelligence algorithms that can be used in SageMaker, an AWS tool for training and running artificial intelligence models. A start-up called Algorithmia offers a marketplace of more than 5,000 AI algorithms.But that's not everything that Algorithmia does. ""Our real power comes from our ability to deploy and manage models at scale,"" Algorithmia co-founder and CEO Diego Oppenheimer wrote in an email.That can happen atop Amazon's cloud, or in other clouds, like Microsoft Azure -- or, alternatively, in corporate data centers.""I think AWS's marketplace will cement the notion that discoverability and accessibility of AI models is key to success and adoption in the industry, which we have been preaching for years,"" Oppenheimer said.Amazon is also reportedly working on a service that would compete with MongoDB, a company that sells subscriptions and services around the MongoDB open-source database software — an AWS-based version of the database is available — although AWS didn't announce anything along those lines this week.In past years, Amazon has announced other products that competed with select customers, including Dropbox, which has since become more reliant on its own data center infrastructure, although it does still use Amazon, according to its latest earnings report. Amazon announced its file-sharing service Zocalo in 2014 and has since renamed it WorkDocs.Another example is Elastic, which went public last month. Elastic's team commercializes the Elasticsearch open-source search software, among other components. In 2015, months after Elastic announced a cloud implementation of Elasticsearch that can be run on AWS, AWS itself launched a hosted version of Elasticsearch. But Elastic doesn't support Amazon's version.Elastic addressed the competitive dynamic between itself and Amazon in regulatory filings this year.""Amazon competes with us for potential customers, and while Amazon cannot provide our proprietary software, the pricing of Amazon's offerings may limit our ability to adjust the price of our products,"" Elastic said in a filing in September.In a statement, Amazon said, ""If you look at the history of AWS, we deliver what our customers ask us to build. There are times when there is some degree of overlap with what our customers offer, but most of these market segments are quite large and support several successful entries. And, for customers who've built meaningful offerings with significant functionality, we've yet to see these companies struggle to keep growing simply because AWS offers something in that area, too.""WATCH: Cloud play may be best as 2018 ends: Cramer"
1112,2013-06-11T07:57:05-0400," Microsoft spent over an hour and a half showcasing the Xbox One and the many games that will launch with the new console—but only one moment made the entire crowd gasp.    Phil Spencer, general manager of Microsoft Game Studios, announced Monday that Microsoft's next generation console would be available in November—at a price of $499. And almost immediately, the air went out of the room.    Analysts and gamers has expected Microsoft to price the Xbox One at least $100 lower—and they were quick to voice their disappointment.    ""The launch price is above our expectations, and potentially pushing the envelope as Microsoft looks to expand the console beyond the core gaming demographic and to a broader consumer audience,"" said Edward Williams of BMO Capital Markets.    The Xbox One has already been a source of controversy since its debut, as confusion about the system's policies regarding used games, game sharing and the need for an always-on Internet connection persisted.    After issuing conflicting statements, Microsoft finally offered its official policies on each late last week. While the gaming world was happy to get clarity, not everyone was happy with the answers.    Now they're upset once again with the system's price, raising the question: Will this continuing series of controversies hurt Microsoft's chances in the next generation of game systems?   Long term, that remains to be seen, but short term, it might. The question is how much?    Like the PlayStation 4, the Xbox One will be supply constrained this holiday season. That's by design, of course. There's no better way to position your product as being a must-have than by ensuring there's not quite enough at retail.    And while people might be grumbling now, there's a contingent of core gamers who are early adaptors—and will be willing to buy new consoles regardless of price when they first come out, giving them bragging rights among their friends.   Sony, however, seized the opportunity to win over consumers—announcing Monday night that the PS4 would cost $399—$100 less than the Xbox One. And undercutting the Xbox One's price was just one of the many shots Sony took at Microsoft at its annual E3 press conference.    To raucous applause, Sony's Jack Tretton also announced that the PS4 would put no restrictions on used games, letting players play used games and lend titles to friends. Additionally, he said, the system will not require any form of Internet connectivity, a direct hit at Xbox One's convoluted online connection requirements.    ""If you enjoy playing single player games offline, the PlayStation 4 won't require you to check in online—and it won't stop working if you haven't authenticated within 24 hours,"" said Tretton, president of Sony Computer Entertainment of America.

Microsoft has offered subsidized versions of the Xbox 360 for the past year, charging just $99 for the system if buyers agree to subscribe to Xbox Live for two years. Many analysts had expected the company to offer something similar with the Xbox One, but it's possible Microsoft felt there wasn't a need to do so this early in the system's life.    Of course, that's not a strategy that worked well for Sony this generation. The PlayStation 3 was originally priced at $599— $100 higher than Xbox 360—and quickly lost ground to the competition.    And for the Xbox One, the competition may not be limited to just Sony and Microsoft.    ""When you're on the cusp of facing massive competition in the living room from Apple and Google, what's in Microsoft's best interest is to drive as large of an install base as quickly as possible,"" says Colin Sebastian of R.W. Baird.    Of course, it's also entirely possible that $499 isn't the only price the Xbox One will sell at. Microsoft is said to be still in negotiations with Comcast and other companies about supplementing the cost. Should those come to fruition before launch, it could offer an alternative to consumers.    Microsoft has had the industry's best-selling console for 28 months—and the Xbox 360 will likely maintain that lead for some time, even with the introduction of next generation systems. But if it wants to continue to lead the field, it has to hope the games and business deals it has signed with publishing partners will be sufficiently strong to make players get over any bad will the price and its other policies might have created. In the end, content is king.    ""The risk you face with pricing the hardware too high is it limits the number of games people can buy,"" said Sebastian.    There's also, to some degree, the Internet echo chamber at work here. Gamers love to complain, but if the games are good enough, they'll usually buy them. And at this point, there's no better thing to complain about than the price of a console.    ""People would have complained if it was $399,"" said P.J. McNealy of Digital World Research. ""People would have complained if it was $299. And if it was free, it wouldn't have been free enough.""

1113,2013-06-10T15:51:51-0400," Microsoft has its head in the cloud with Xbox One.    The company focused on how cloud computing will make games for its next-generation Xbox One console more immersive during its Monday presentation at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3). Microsoft announced last week that the console must be connected to the Internet every 24 hours to operate and that, ideally, the system would always be online.   ""The platform features and capabilities of Xbox One allow developers to push the boundaries of creativity and push the genre in new directions,"" Phil Harrison, Microsoft's vice president, told the crowd at University of Southern California's Galen Center.   The upcoming console's cloud-computing capabilities were demonstrated by fleshing out dense environments in third-person, open-world games such as the zombie-fighting sequel ""Dead Rising 3"" and the over-the-top cartoony shooter ""Sunset Overdrive."" The racing simulator ""Forza Motorsport5"" introduced a feature called ""drivatar,"" which mimics players' driving styles and allows their drivatars to play for them offline.   ""It's about delivering real human behavior,"" said Creative Director Dan Greenawalt at Turn 10 Studios, developer of ""Forza Motorsport.""  Microsoft announced Monday that the console, which it debuted earlier this year at its headquarters in Redmond, Wash., will be released in November and cost $499.    Other games showcased Monday that are coming to Xbox One included the historical third-person game ""Ryse: Son of Rome,"" hard-knuckled brawler ""Killer Instinct,"" a bigger edition of ""Minecraft,"" terra-forming simulator ""Project Spark"" and a new installment of the sci-fi shooter ""Halo.""   Monday's flashy event concluded with the debut of the multiplayer shooter ""Titanfall,"" the first game from Respawn Entertainment. It was founded by Vince Zampella and Jason West, creators of ""Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.""   Microsoft didn't address concerns over connectivity, used games and privacy issues with the Xbox One, which will feature a new version of its camera-based Kinect sensor. In a blog post on Microsoft's site last week before E3, the company outlined more details about the console, including that there would be restrictions on how previously played or used games could be shared.   Microsoft kicked off Monday's presentation by revealing the Xbox 360 is getting a makeover with a design inspired by the Xbox One.    Yusuf Mehdi, Microsoft's vice president of marketing and strategy, said the updated Xbox 360 is ""smaller, sleeker and as quiet as ever."" He added it would be available beginning Monday.   The company boasted that hundreds of new games are still coming to Xbox 360, which was originally released eight years ago as the high-definition successor to the Xbox. Microsoft's Xbox 360 has outsold rivals such as Nintendo's Wii and Sony's PlayStation 3 for the past two years. "

Meanwhile, a Senate Democratic aide told CNBC that the ability of Paul to single-handedly block the nomination ""should not be overstated"" as Paul would need 40 other senators to join him to cut off a motion to end debate and bring the nomination to the floor. Although hearings have not yet been scheduled, the aide said the leadership at this point is confident the nomination will succeed.

1117,2013-05-30T15:25:50-0400,"  A former corporate strategy manager at Microsoft plans to create the first national marijuana brand, and said he is kicking off his Seattle-based business by acquiring medical cannabis dispensaries in three states.    Jamen Shively, 45, envisions his enterprise becoming the leader in both recreational and medical cannabis—much like Starbucks is in coffee, he said.    Shively, who was with Microsoft six years and left in 2009, said he was soliciting investors for $10 million in start-up money.    (Read More: The 16 Top Medical Marijuana Strains)  The use, sale and possession of marijuana remains illegal in the U.S. under federal law. But two states have legalized recreational marijuana use and are among 18 states that allow it for medical use. Washington and Colorado became the first states to allow recreational marijuana when voters approved legalization in November.    ""It's a giant market in search of a brand,"" Shively said of the marijuana industry. ""We would be happy if we get 40 percent of it worldwide.""    The sale of marijuana remains illegal in much of the world, although some countries—mainly in Europe and the Americas—have decriminalized its possession in small quantities. A larger number have decriminalized or legalized marijuana for medical use.    A 2005 United Nations report estimated the value of the global marijuana trade at $142 billion.   Shively acknowledges that his business plans conflict with federal law and are complicated by regulations in Washington and Colorado. He said he is interested in buying dispensaries that comply with local and state rules and are less likely to attract the scrutiny of authorities.    ""If they want to come talk to me, I'll be delighted to meet with them,"" he said of federal officials. ""I'll tell them everything that we're doing and show them all our books.""   Washington's marijuana consultant, Mark Kleiman, said he was skeptical.

""We've created the first risk-mitigated vehicles for investing directly in this business opportunity,"" he said.

Cisco, the world's biggest maker of network equipment, asked the EU on Wednesday to annul the approval of Microsoft's Skype deal. Basically, Cisco claims that Microsoft has an unfair advantage because it makes up so much of the Internet-based voice and video communication service market, a sector that Cisco has been trying to expand its presence.    (Read More: Cisco: Microsoft's Deal With Skype Is Monopolistic)   Skype accounts for about one-third of the voice calls made globally and boasts 280 million people using the service for more than 100 minutes each month, said Kevin Turner, Microsoft's chief operating officer, earlier this year.    ""We don't really compete with a specific competitor, we compete on market transitions, so our ability to win in the cloud—where we literally grew 70 percent in the last quarter—where we win in wireless and where we win in video, has been balancing a communications business that has been flat the last quarter or two,"" Chambers said.    Judges in the EU are expected to rule on Cisco's case against Microsoft in the coming months.    However, while Cisco's communications business may be flat, its shown great growth in other areas, like mobile, Chambers said.    ""Mobile was probably our Achilles' heel 2½ years ago, it's now our strength. We are the No.1 player in almost every aspect of the mobile market, whether it's service provider or Wi-Fi capability,"" he said.    Chambers also said he sees huge potential for Cisco as more devices, like wearable computers, become connected to the Internet.    ""We want to do things to where new growth is going to occur, whether it's Apple, Google or other players, the more networks, the more storage required, the more moving information around, the new generation of technology is kind of mobile in the cloud, analytics and big data, that sets us up for the next Internet, something called the Internet of Everything,"" he said.   _ By CNBC's Cadie Thompson.

1120,2013-05-22T07:37:39-0400," Microsoft unveiled its long-anticipated next generation console Xbox One on Tuesday, but it was its inclusion of live TV, rather than its gaming capabilities that set tongues wagging.   ""I think what Microsoft is doing here is taking on not just Sony Playstation and Nintendo; it is taking on Apple and Google as well,"" Will Dunn from consumer electronics magazine Stuff told CNBC on Wednesday.   ""People have been talking about smart TV for a long time, but this could be the first machine to really do it.

1121,2018-12-06T14:29:39-0500,"Amazon's Rekognition, a facial recognition cloud service for developers, has been under scrutiny for its use by law enforcement and a pitch to the U.S. immigration enforcement agency by the company.But many people might not understand what the technology actually does, or why it's been in the spotlight.We break down some of the most common uses for the technology by corporations in media, across social channels, in finance and in government.Rekognition, Amazon's facial recognition tool and one of many AWS cloud services for developers, has been the subject of controversy for its use by law enforcement agencies and a reported sales pitch to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Competitors have also weighed in, at least indirectly: on Thursday, Microsoft shared a post calling for greater government regulation of facial recognition technology, its uses and potential for abuse.But most people might not know what the service actually does. Companies are using it for far more than facial recognition, especially among media companies, social platforms and in international finance.In fact, it's the flexibility of the platform itself that has led to the greatest controversy, likely to continue as companies expand how they use the product.Rekognition is a developer tool with several different functions, including facial recognition, ""pathing"" — which involves tracking an object, like a soccer ball, through a video frame — and finding and reading text in images and on video that is hard to see with the naked eye.Rekognition is also used for what's known as facial analysis or sentiment analysis, which is meant to tag images as showing people who are smiling or frowning to record their projected emotions. The service uses artificial intelligence to ""learn"" which faces or objects are important to the individual corporate or agency user.In the private sector, the service has been perhaps most enthusiastically adopted by companies in the marketing and advertising space, particularly those that have huge catalogs of photos and videos that they want to categorize and tag for easy searching.According to case studies provided by Amazon, social media companies use the program to weed out ""fake followers"" and find ""micro-influencers"" who have strong followings on social networks and could be used to promote brands. The White House has used Rekognition in an application that lets users take a photo and find which first lady they most closely resemble.Companies like ScrippsNetworks Interactive C-SPAN use the technology to more quickly sift through hours of video and gigabytes of photos in order to correctly tag individuals speaking or featured in pictures.Financial services companies in countries where bank customers don't have regular access to physical bank locations and rely on mobile banking, such as payments start-up Paylater, have also used the technology to validate transactions.The ""pathing"" functionality allows these companies to closely track an object or player — a typical use has been in sports coverage — throughout a single video shot. The company has said the pathing function cannot be combined with facial recognition, and objects can only be tracked through a single camera-shot, not across multiple cameras.The program can be adapted by developers for a company's individual needs. Because this feature also takes it out of the control or overview of Amazon, many people, including some Amazon employees, have taken issue with how the technology may be used.Rekognition's biggest recent controversy involved Amazon's pitch to ICE, which was uncovered by the non-profit Project on Government Oversight. A number of Amazon employees objected to the use of the software because of the immigration revelations.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) criticized the company for the pitch and for the technology in general.""People should be free to walk down the street without being watched by the government,"" the ACLU said in July. ""By automating mass surveillance, facial recognition systems like Rekognition threaten this freedom, posing a particular threat to communities already unjustly targeted in the current political climate.""AWS CEO Andy Jassy reportedly told employees in November that the company will continue supporting the product. Amazon won't comment on how or which agencies use the service currently, but some have been public about it.One of those agencies is the Washington County, Oregon, Sheriff's Office, which uses Rekognition for assistance in finding ""persons of interest"" using existing mugshots.""There are nearly 20,000 different bookings (when a person is processed into the jail) every year,"" wrote Chris Adzima, an information systems analyst in the Washington County Sheriff's Office, in a blog post last year. ""As time passes, officers' memories of individual bookings fade.""The office also uses Rekognition to investigate Amber alerts and Silver alerts, which respectively aim to help track down missing children or senior citizens, respectively.In response to some of these controversies, Amazon has also touted the technology's work for organizations that work with law enforcement to advocate for crime victims. Those include the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children and anti-human trafficking organization Marinus Analytics, according to an AWS spokesperson."

The company also said Tuesday it is partnering with game makers to produce 15 exclusive games on the console.   At the tech giant's Redmond, Wash., headquarters, interactive entertainment business president Don Mattrick said the new Xbox aims to be a single device that can provide all the entertainment for a living room, and to simplify an entertainment experience that ""has become too complex.""   The console is controlled by voice and motion with much more sensitive sensors than the existing Xbox console. The device is personalized so when a user says ""Xbox One"" and turns on the device, it shows a personalized home screen, to browse games, TV, movies and music.   The biggest additions are Xbox One's inclusion of live TV as well as Skype. The technology allows users to easily switch between each of the entertainment options—live TV, games, music, movies, and Internet Explorer. Instead of having to switch inputs, users can instantly switch with a quick oral request to the voice sensor.   And unlike other consoles, two windows can be open at once so users can play games and have music on at the same time. ESPN showcased the ability to watch live basketball on TV and to look up player stats at the same time.   Of course, there was plenty of talk about games, and Electronic Arts joined Microsoft on stage. During the event, Microsoft Studios announced plans to introduce 15 exclusive games in the first year of Xbox One, eight of which are new franchises. Microsoft also unveiled a detailed teaser for Activision Blizzard's new ""Call of Duty: Ghosts"" game, which will include exclusive multiplayer content and capabilities for the Xbox One version.    But even some of Microsoft's hit games, like Halo, are now entertainment properties as well. Steven Spielberg is partnering with Microsoft to create a live-action TV show. And television veteran Nancy Tellem, now head of Xbox Studios, says the company is working on the next generation of TV, which will be personalized, social and interactive.   The event closed with the unveiling of the new trailer for ""Call of Duty,"" which showcased the new technology enabling multiplayer capability and imagery to make it all look and feel more real. But the real game news will come at the E3 expo in June.

Hood, 41, the first woman to hold the CFO post at Microsoft, takes over from Peter Klein, who announced his departure in April. She takes up the job immediately, while Klein will remain at the company through the end of June. A former Goldman Sachs banker, Hood joined Microsoft in late 2002. While at the Office division—Microsoft's most profitable unit—she worked on the high-profile acquisitions of online chat service Skype and business networking company Yammer.

""Key aspects"" of how the software is used will be changed when Microsoft releases an updated version of the operating system this year, Tammy Reller, head of marketing and finance for the Windows business, said in an interview with the Financial Times. Referring to difficulties many users have had with mastering the software, she added: ""The learning curve is definitely real.""   Analysts warned that changing course would be a significant admission of failure for Steve Ballmer, chief executive, who called the October launch of Windows 8 a ""bet-the-company"" moment as Microsoft sought to respond to the success of Apple's iPad.

Ms Reller refused to reveal details of the changes Microsoft would make to Windows 8. However, the clamor from reviewers has become overwhelming for a return to a more familiar PC interface. Ms Reller said PC users had faced difficulties adapting to the new software.   Pressure has been building for Windows 8 PCs to launch the familiar desktop view when turned on – and to bring back the ""start"" button featured in the lower left corner of the screen in previous releases.

""It's this combination of software and services that's really powerful and leading their larger customers to commit to longer-term deals.""   Microsoft isn't ignoring its consumer businesses either, Thill said.    ""We believe they're addressing the downfalls of Windows 8 in an aggressive manner,"" the UBS analyst said.

1133,2018-11-29T08:20:11-0500,"Amazon Web Services will offer AWS-branded servers that will work with existing cloud services.AWS is taking on traditional hardware vendors with its on-premises service.Amazon cloud chief Andy Jassy said that during the first half of 2018, he was consistently getting requests from customers who wanted Amazon's help not just in the cloud, but also in their own data centers.For some companies, there are regulatory concerns or privacy issues that limit their ability to use public cloud, while other businesses just aren't ready to abandon their own equipment and facilities. So Jassy was asked if Amazon Web Services could go out of its comfort zone and bring some of its advanced technologies to the on-premises world.On Wednesday, he answered that question with a definitive yes.At the AWS re:Invent conference in Las Vegas, Amazon introduced AWS Outposts, its boldest effort yet to take on legacy hardware vendors like Cisco, Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise by bringing AWS-branded boxes to traditional data centers.Customers ultimately want ""the lowest possible prices,"" Jassy said in a session with reporters. When asked whether the Outposts technology will eventually be able to run on data center equipment from the likes of Dell and HPE, Jassy said, ""it's possible.""In prior years at re:Invent, AWS rolled out products to help clients move massive amounts of data into Amazon's data centers. They included a Snowmobile truck for packaging up data on hard drives and driving them to Amazon's facilities, and rugged Snowball devices for storing data that companies mail to AWS.But AWS is now acknowledging that many companies want to stay on-premises.The new Outposts hardware will come with some of the most popular AWS computing offerings and storage software, while a separate option will package virtualization technology from VMware.The hybrid concept is one that AWS' top rival has already embraced. Microsoft, the second-largest public cloud provider, introduced Azure Stack in 2015, a set of tools that combined Microsoft's cloud technology with hardware from partners including Cisco, Dell EMC, HPE and Lenovo.Amazon, which is starting with its own hardware, will deliver and install Outposts at customers' facilities and then provide maintenance, repair the hardware and automatically update the software. The systems can be as small as a single server and as large as multiple racks full of data-center gear.The new approach will require Amazon to hire people focused on selling and servicing hardware.""We're very comfortable running high volume, relatively low-margin businesses,"" Jassy said. ""We know how to keep our costs low.""None of this is to suggest that AWS is slowing down its efforts to provide an increasing number of tools and services to its public cloud customers.Amazon's other product launches on Wednesday included two blockchain services for developers focused on the distributed ledger technology and a file server product that works with Microsoft software.Drawing on its chip-development group, AWS also said that it has built custom chips for artificial intelligence that will be available from its cloud, following the lead of other internet companies like Google and Alibaba.And AWS announced a new product for building personalization features and recommendation systems for applications, a tool for training systems that use a trendy type of artificial intelligence called reinforcement learning and debuted a marketplace of AI algorithms.AWS now has some 140 services available to cloud customers.But only one product brings Amazon's servers to you, and that's a prospect that's sure to cause even more anxiety for traditional hardware vendors who are already losing billions of dollars a year in business to AWS.""We have hundreds of data centers in lots of places that require all kinds of maintenance and real-time work"" Jassy said. ""We have a little bit of an idea of how to do it."""
1134,2013-04-27T01:40:26-0400,"  On Wednesday, Microsoft confirmed the worst-kept secret in the video game world: It plans to unveil its next generation console on May 21.    (Read More: Microsoft to Reveal Next-Generation Xbox on May 21)   Like Sony's PlayStation 4, the new console is expected to hit stores this holiday season and many analysts and investors are hanging their hopes on the new machines to kickstart the video game industry back into growth mode.    Microsoft has been coy about what features the new Xbox will have—and not even the most ardent rumormongers claim to know what the console will be named. But in speaking with developers who have spent time with the developer kit, a few details have emerged.    (Read More: Xbox Live Challenges Cable Box )  The new system will likely run on an AMD processor, rather than the IBM PowerPC technology the Xbox 360 uses. For users, this means they won't be able to play their Xbox 360 games on the new system. (Similarly, the PlayStation 4 will not be backwards compatible.) The system will also beef up its system RAM to aid developers in making games.    Kinect, the motion sensor peripheral Microsoft introduced in late 2010, will be an integral part of the new Xbox and has been dramatically upgraded. Microsoft will also continue to emphasize other forms of entertainment as much as it does games. (In 2011, Microsoft brought Nancy Tellem, former president of CBS Television Studios, on board to lead its efforts to form an Xbox studio.)    ""We now have a tremendous opportunity to transform [the Xbox] into the center of all things entertainment—from games, music and fitness to news, sports, live events, television series and movies—so consumers have one destination for all their entertainment needs,"" Tellem said upon her hiring.   The Xbox 360 has been the top selling console in the U.S. for 27 consecutive months, according to The NPD Group—and analysts say Microsoft is the company to beat in the next generation.    The added degree of difficulty with this next generation, though, is that the leap in graphics fidelity will not be as pronounced as it has in previous new consoles. And that could mean a slower adoption rate among consumers.    ""The next-generation consoles present only a modest improvement in graphics quality over current generation consoles, suggesting to us that many gamers will be slower to adopt the new technology immediately,"" said Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities.    The key to success for the new Xbox, then, may lie in its non-gaming features.    ""Console releases really aren't about games anymore,"" said John Taylor of Arcadia Investment. ""They're as much about media centers, access to the Internet, social networking and the whole selection of interactive opportunities. There's a 46 million [person] audience for Xbox Live that's already familiar with the service—and Microsoft's goal should be to get that to 100 million.""   This generation, Microsoft spent a lot of time, money and energy striking deals with cable and satellite providers to bring their content into the Xbox Live environment. And some believe those relationships will expand dramatically in the next generation.    There have, in fact, been some reports that Microsoft wants the new Xbox to act as an additional layer on top of the cable box— similar to Google TV, letting Xbox Live subscribers talk and participate in polls during shows. Pachter, in fact, expects the system to have an IPTV tuner that will allow cable operators to deliver services over the Internet outside of their regulated geographic boundaries.    ""The cornerstone of the [Xbox] Live universe is still core gamers—and over the last several years Microsoft has made big strides in expanding that user base and capturing households that you wouldn't call core gaming households,"" Taylor said. ""That has never been as important as it now. I think the investment Microsoft has been making in Live and [the decision to provide] a robust slate of network services is going to really start to pay off in this generation.""   Of course, the first trick for Microsoft—or any console maker—is to get the devices in people's homes. Nintendo has largely failed to do so thus far, with life to date Wii U sales under 3.5 million—far short of the company's initial estimates of 5.5 million.    Pachter said Microsoft's ace up the sleeve could once again tie in to its relationships with cable companies.    ""If we are right [in our IPTV theory],"" he said, ""Any of Microsoft's MSO partners will have an incentive to subsidize the purchase of the next Xbox in exchange for a long-term service commitment, similar to the cell phone model,"" Pachter said. ""If the subsidies are steep, it is likely that the next Xbox will appear more affordable to many consumers than currently anticipated, and it may capture market share faster than many expect."" "

""We continue to think that the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will announce a reduction in those purchases on Wednesday,"" wrote analysts at Capital Economics.    ""Given how far bond yields have risen in recent months in response to this prospect, we doubt that there would be a particularly adverse market reaction.

1136,2013-04-18T17:17:00-0400," Microsoft said on Thursday that Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein was leaving the company, as it struggles with sharply declining personal computer sales and a lukewarm reception for its new Windows 8 operating system.    Klein, an 11-year Microsoft veteran with 3 1/2 years as CFO, is the latest in a line of top-level executives to leave the company, following Windows head Steven Sinofsky last November. Some have questioned whether Chief Executive Steve Ballmer is still the right leader for Microsoft, whose shares have remained essentially flat for the last decade.   In announcing Klein's departure to employees, Ballmer praised Klein's part in the acquisitions of Skype and the social network Yammer, and said Klein ""has had a profound impact on the finance profession overall, and exhibited good oversight on cost controls as CFO."" (Full text below.)   In his resignation letter, Klein wrote: ""I am proud of the work that finance has done and the impact we have had on the Company.

What is Microsoft's stock doing now? (Click here for the latest after-hours quote.)   The software giant also reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that exceeded analyst expectations.   Earnings rose to $6 billion, or 72 cents per share, from $5.1 billion, or 60 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.   Revenue improved 18 percent to $20.49 billion from $17.41 billion a year ago.   Analysts had expected the company to report earnings of 68 cents a share on $20.5 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.  Microsoft's profit was boosted by some deferred revenue from its Windows, Office and videogame operations, but cut severely by a big fine by European antitrust regulators for breaking promises relating to expanding the choice of Internet browsers on Windows.   Analysts have been pulling back profit forecasts for Microsoft in the light of flagging PC sales as consumers flock to tablets and smartphones.   In his letter, Ballmer wrote: ""Our long term bets on the cloud are paying off, and while the mobile device environment is challenging, the decisions we made with Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 set us up well for long term growth."" CFO Peter Klein's Resignation Letter:    One noteworthy characteristic of Finance is the regularity of its rhythm – month end, quarter end, year end.  Every one of those milestones marks the passage of time.  And as time passes, and milestones are marked, we all periodically reflect on our lives, our goals, and our priorities.  As we approach the end of the fiscal year, I have been reflecting in that way.  And I have decided that now is a good time for me to step away from Microsoft and take some time to spend with my family in a way that I haven't had the opportunity to do in the 30 years I have been working.    This has not been an easy decision.  I love Microsoft.  I love my job.  When I joined Microsoft 11 years ago I had this loosely held belief that people were one of the most important elements of any job or any company.  I had no idea how profoundly true that is, but I do now.  People are everything.  Microsoft is the most amazing collection of talented, passionate and caring people I could ever imagine being associated with.  It's been an honor and my good fortune to have been part of that.     I am proud of the work that Finance has done and the impact we have had on the Company.  One reason that now is a good time to leave is that the organization is very strong, and I am delighted we will be naming an internal candidate.  I couldn't be more optimistic about both the Company's and Finance's future.    Looking ahead, I have no specific plans.  In the short term I will work to ensure a smooth transition.  After that I intend to spend time with my extended family which is dispersed throughout the country and hopefully get to some long deferred travel.  For the last 11 years Microsoft has been my family and now I am going to focus on my other family.            Thanks for being such a great team – I will follow your success with great interest and pride.    Peter  CEO Steve Ballmer's Announcement to Employees:  Today in our earnings release, we announced that after nearly four years as CFO and 11 years at Microsoft, Peter Klein has decided to step down as CFO and leave Microsoft at the end of our current fiscal year. I will be naming a new CFO from our finance leadership team in the next several weeks.          Peter has been a key part of my leadership team and a strong advisor to me during his tenure. He helped drive the successful Skype and Yammer acquisitions, has had a profound impact on the finance profession overall, and exhibited good oversight on cost controls as CFO. I have really enjoyed working with Peter, and appreciate his many contributions to the finance organization, to Microsoft and to me.    I'm sure all of you have seen media coverage from the last two weeks. As I said in our earnings release, our long term bets on the cloud are paying off, and while the mobile device environment is challenging, the decisions we made with Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 set us up well for long term growth.

""I don't think they're a great bellwether,"" he said, adding that on average it beats earnings by 2 percent, followed by its stock dropping 2 percent a week later.   ""Truthfully, there's not much to get excited about here,"" Brown said. ""It's a 0 percent revenue growth rate. They've actually been missing on the top line.""   TheStreet CIO Stephanie Link interjected.   ""You don't pay for this company for revenue, though,"" she said. ""You never have. It's double-digit earnings grower because they have other things. Fifty percent of their business is recurring revenue. It's because they're buying back a ton of stock, and they're cutting a lot of costs.

1138,2013-04-16T13:40:41-0400," Microsoft is cutting prices for hosting and processing customers' online data in an aggressive challenge to Amazon.com's lead in the growing business of cloud computing.   The world's biggest software company said Tuesday that it will match Amazon's prices for some of the more common online data services it provides, which would mean price cuts of 21 percent to 33 percent.   It is Microsoft's most aggressive move yet in the arena. The company hopes its Windows Azure business can win customers from Amazon Web Services, which pioneered the renting of technology resources such as computing power and storage, known as cloud computing.   ""If you had concerns that Windows Azure was more expensive, we're putting those concerns to rest today,"" said Steven Martin, an executive in the Azure business.  Windows Azure, part of Microsoft's fast-growing Server and Tools unit, wants to supplant Amazon as the backbone of many companies' cloud infrastructure, for example, by storing and handling data for online applications, using vast data centers in remote locations.  The main benefit of the approach is that businesses do not have to buy, build and run their own technology set-up, instead paying for only what they use.   This is a growing business for Microsoft, which claims more than 200,000 Windows Azure customers but does not break out revenue from the business.  Amazon Web Services generated about $1.8 billion in revenue last year and could pull in $20 billion by the end of this decade as larger companies use its cloud services more, Bernstein Research analysts estimated last week in a note to investors.  This success has lured other large technology companies into the cloud computing business, including Google and Microsoft.  AWS is known for its low prices, which have dropped more than 20 times since its launch in 2006. "

1141,2013-04-10T15:49:39-0400," Microsoft will not roll out Office software on Apple's iOS or the Google Android platform until 2014, according to a recent report. The Office suite has long been rumored to be coming to the iPhone and iPad, but Microsoft has been mum on any official plans for offering the software on Apple devices.    However, according to a   ZDNet report citing sources close to the matter, Microsoft is in no hurry to launch an app on other platforms. In fact, it has been using the Office suite—which includes programs such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint— as leverage to entice people to buy Microsoft's own Surface tablet.    The tactic isn't paying off. In fact, the company is losing a lot of money by not offering its products on other platforms, said Adam Holt, an analyst at Morgan Stanley,   In February, Holt said in a note that Microsoft was leaving about $2.5 billion a year on the table by not being on the iPad.

1142,2013-04-11T13:08:20-0400,"With PCs declining and tablets and smartphones ascendant, there's growing concern among Wall Street analysts about Microsoft's stock after its recent move higher.     ""Microsoft and some of the other tech names have had a big move over the last couple of days because of some data coming out of the Asian manufacturers that March was a pretty good month for building machines,"" Rick Sherlund, head of U.S. technology research at Nomura, told CNBC on Thursday.  Investors were expecting PCs to be down about 7 percent in the quarter, but data from research firms Gartner and IDC have them down 11 percent to 14 percent, he said.    (Read More: PCs Worse Than Expected: Even Asia Has Stopped Buying)    ""The fundamentals are slipping for the core business,"" Sherlund said.    That decline had him moving to the sidelines on the stock Thursday, downgrading Microsoft to ""neutral"" from ""buy"" with a $32 price target as the market grapples with how much of a secular decline Microsoft is experiencing and how much benefit it may see from an upgrade cycle.    ""PCs are a mature market in the enterprise space and in gradual decline, while in the consumer space half the market does not need Office, so they don't need Windows and don't need Microsoft,"" Sherlund wrote in a note. ""These consumers want an easy-to-use experience to consume content with their tablet or smartphone, with disposable apps and a rapid pace of innovation.   ""If the need is just for a tablet, Microsoft is not the first or second choice in the market, and Windows 8 does not change that dynamic,"" he added.      Other analysts were even more bearish, with Goldman Sachs slapping a rare ""sell"" rating on the stock, given worsening PC trends and a lack of traction in tablets and smartphones.    But Sherlund sees opportunity later in the year, when a new Intel processor will give light, thin notebooks a 10-hour battery life and reduce the price to about $600 from $900 to $1,000 today, he said. That could spur the half of consumers who still use notebooks to finally consider upgrading their aging machines, he said.    And depending an increase in PC demand, the stock could do better. Microsoft shares remain attractively priced at nine times 2013 earnings, excluding cash, with a free cash flow yield of 11 percent.

1143,2013-04-09T04:55:00-0400,"  Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson struck a deal on Monday to buy Microsoft's Mediaroom IPTV business, which makes software used by phone companies to deliver television over the Internet, making it the world's leader in a growing business.       The sale marks the end of Microsoft's two-decade effort to put itself at the front of a technology shift toward internet television that did not materialize the way it expected. The world's biggest software company said it will now focus its TV ambitions on its popular Xbox game console, which is a vehicle for all types of entertainment.        Ericsson said it expected to close the deal for the business, which employs more than 400 people worldwide, during the second half of 2013. It did not disclose a purchase price, though a company official provided a ballpark figure.       ""This deal is within range where we previously bought a company called Optimi for $99 million and where we also bought LG Nortel for $234 million,"" said Ove Anebygd, Vice President and Head of TV at Ericsson. ""So this is somewhere in between the two.""       Ericsson said the deal would make the company, already the world's biggest mobile networks maker, the leading provider of IPTV with a 25 percent market share. Microsoft said the Mediaroom platform was offered by more than 40 operators and powered 22 million set-top boxes around the world. Focus on Services      Internet protocol television (IPTV) uses the same technology that powers the Internet to transmit multimedia content over telecom and cable networks. Ericsson wants to cater to phone companies that are competing with cable, satellite and web-based media providers.       The Mediaroom platform is the TV technology used by television service providers such as AT&amp;T, Deutsche Telekom, Telefonica and Swisscom, Ericsson said.       ""This makes a nice strategic fit, but it is hard to estimate the impact on key figures since they are providing no financial information,"" Alandsbanken analyst Lars Soderfjall said.       With competition from Chinese network providers stiff over the last few years, Ericsson has focused increasingly on services, such as managing networks for operators, and on software, where it has more of a competitive advantage.       It is a leading player in solutions that enable operators to charge for online services and as part of its shift from hardware-based products has also built up a presence in IPTV, a position underpinned by acquisitions such as that of video technology firm Tandberg Television in 2007.           ""This completes Ericsson's IPTV offer, with ... Mediaroom nicely rounding up the Tandberg TV assets,"" said Alexander Peterc, analyst at Exane BNParibas.      Ericsson said the global IPTV market was estimated to reach 76 million subscribers in 2013 with revenues of $32 billion, growing to 105 million subscribers and $45 billion in 2015.       Ericsson said the deal was subject to customary regulatory approvals and that the business would be integrated into its Support Solutions unit. Microsoft Puts Bets on Xbox      Microsoft entered the IPTV business in the mid-1990s. It never became a major source of revenue for the Seattle-based software maker as most growth in internet TV has come from widely available 'over the top' services like Netflix and Hulu rather than internet TV supplied by phone companies.         The head of Microsoft's interactive entertainment business said Monday's deal allowed his company to ""commit 100 percent of its focus on consumer TV strategy with Xbox.""       From its beginnings at the turn of the century as an upstart rival to Sony and Nintendo, Microsoft's Xbox has grown into the United States' best selling game center, with 76 million now in use around the world. Xbox owners can now buy TV programs, films and music through Microsoft's own store, or access content through Netflix and other suppliers.       Microsoft even set up its own studio last year to create original TV content, although it said on Monday it wants to ""partner"" with film studios, music labels, TV networks and content aggregators to expand offerings on the Xbox.

1144,2014-02-20T13:35:46-0500,"  Ben Reitzes of Barclays has been bullish on Apple for the past 10 years, but that changed Thursday.   The senior technology analyst at Barclays Capital downgraded the tech company to equal weight after keeping an overweight rating on it for a decade, saying that he ""agonized"" over the move. During an interview on ""Squawk on the Street,"" Reitzes said he made the call because most of Apple's new product lines—such as a much-anticipated smartwatch—seem designed only to help sell more iPhones. As the tech industry shifts its emphasis from hardware and operating systems to cloud-based computing and multiplatform software, he added, Apple will be hard-pressed to continue increasing iPhone sales past 10 percent.   (Read more: 'Zero chance' for Apple-Tesla merger: Tech analyst)   ""The market is going to move toward more social, cloud and messaging-type services where there's a potential that the actual smartphone itself could get hollowed out a little bit, and the operating system maybe even becomes a little less important,"" Reitzes said.   Apple shares will have a tough time breaking out of the high $500 range, he said, even with new product categories. The company's shares were down a bit more than 1 percent, to about $530, during the first half of Thursday's session.

According to a recent report from the Verge, Microsoft will preview the new Xbox—code-named Durango—at a special event May 21 and officially reveal it at the video game trade show E3 in June.    (Read More: Things Don't Look So Good for the Video Game Industry )   Though next month's event will be more low-key than the one in June, Microsoft will offer initial details of the device at the smaller event, according to the report.    The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the reported release date.    (Read More: 'Indie' Video Game Consoles You Haven't Heard of Yet )   On Friday, gaming expert and tech blogger Paul Thurrott said that the May event was originally scheduled on April 24. The actual launch of the device should be expected in the fourth quarter, probably early November, he said, adding that it will be a Windows device costing about $500.    While not much is known for certain about new features on the upcoming Xbox, Microsoft is signaling a strong focus on building out its TV streaming service.    The company announced Monday that it had sold Internet protocol TV platform   Mediaroom to Ericsson, saying in a statement that the sale would allow ""Microsoft to commit 100 percent of its focus on consumer TV strategy with Xbox.""   The move suggests that Microsoft will disclose its larger TV strategy when it introduces the new Xbox console.  "

He has a 12 month price target of $850 on the stock, which would be a 5 percent increase from current levels, but said the upside could be even greater.  While Android devices and Apple's iPhone and iPad are the dominant players in the move away from the desktop, Microsoft has recently upped its game with Windows for its own tablets and for smartphones. But so far, those initiatives have failed to gain traction for the software giant, said CLSA analyst Ed Maguire.Maguire does see a 27 percent move to the upside with his $36 price target.

Amazon did not make the list.After a tumultuous year, Facebook has lost its footing as a top-rated employer, based on Glassdoor's 2019 list of the ""Best Places to Work."" After ranking No. 1 last year, Facebook now ranks seventh, dropping from a 4.6 to 4.5 award score out of a perfect 5.Zoom Video Communications supplanted Facebook as the top seat in the tech category.The report comes as Facebook continues to be scrutinized by the public for how it handles user data and misinformation on its platform. The Glassdoor ranking adds data to the speculation that Facebook employees, too, are souring on the company. Glassdoor bases its ranking on eight factors, including work/life balance, senior management and compensation and benefits. On employee satisfaction alone, Facebook has seen a steeper decline, steadily falling from a 4.6 rating in Q1 to a 4.3 in Q4, according to Glassdoor community expert Scott Dobroski.""Facebook employees talked about the 'move fast' culture sometimes moving too fast,"" Dobroski said in an interview with CNBC. He noted that this is the first time Facebook has seen a decline in its award score since 2015. Facebook employees on Glassdoor said they wanted a more robust internal structure and transparency from the company's leadership. ""Its not a major surprise considering what's been going on with Facebook. Employees want to be kept in the loop,"" Dobroski said.Facebook has gone from a hot place to work to a place many employees are itching to leave. Six former Facebook employees told CNBC they have been receiving increasingly more messages from current Facebook employees looking for a way out. They said employees have been motivated to look elsewhere thanks to falling stock prices, continued scandals and the increased bureaucracy that comes with the maturing of any tech company.Other tech companies have also fallen from top spots on Glassdoor's list. Google dropped three spots, landing at eighth place with an award score of 4.4. Amazon still hasn't made it onto the list since Glassdoor first began publishing it in 2009.

The world's largest software company said the security intrusion was ""similar"" to recent ones reported by Apple and Facebook.  The incident, reported on one of the company's public blogs happened ""recently"", but Microsoft said it chose not to make any statement publicly while it gathered information about the attack.  ""This type of cyberattack is no surprise to Microsoft and other companies that must grapple with determined and persistent adversaries,"" said Matt Thomlinson, general manager of Trustworthy Computing Security at Microsoft, in the company's blog post.  Over the past week or so, both Apple and Facebook said computers used by employees were attacked after visiting a software developer website infected with malicious software.  The attacks come at a time of broader concern about computer security.

1152,2013-02-19T07:16:52-0500," Microsoft is so confident it has the Internet's best email service that it is about to spend at least $30 million to send its message across the U.S.   The barrage begins Tuesday when Microsoft's twist on email, Outlook.com, escalates an assault on rival services from Google, Yahoo, AOL, and a long list of Internet service providers.   As part of the process, all users of Microsoft's Hotmail and other email services operating under different domains such as MSN.com will be automatically converted to Outlook.com by the summer, if they don't voluntarily switch before then. All the old messages, contacts, and settings in the old inboxes will be exported to Outlook.com. Users will also be able to keep their old addresses.   Email remains a key battleground, even at a time when more people are texting each other on phones.   (Read More: Microsoft Is Losing $2.5 Billion a Year by NOT Being on iPad)  People still regularly check their inboxes, albeit increasingly on their smartphones. The recurring email habit provides Internet companies a way to keep people coming back to websites. It gives people a reason to log in during their visits so it's easier for email providers to track their activities. Frequent visits and personal identification are two of the keys to selling ads, the main way most websites make money.   That's why Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo have been retooling their email services in recent months.   After keeping Outlook.com in a ""preview"" phase since July 31, Microsoft is ready to accept all comers.   To welcome new users, Microsoft is financing what it believes to be the biggest marketing blitz in the history of email. Outlook.com will be featured in ads running on prime-time TV, radio stations, websites, billboards, and buses. Microsoft expects to spend somewhere between $30 million to $90 million on the Outlook campaign, which will run for at least three months.   The Outlook ads will overlap with an anti-Gmail marketing campaign that Microsoft launched earlier this month. The ""Scroogled"" attacks depict Gmail as a snoopy service that scans the contents of messages to deliver ads related to topics being discussed.   The Gmail ads are meant to be educational while the Outlook campaign is motivational, said Dharmesh Mehta, Outlook.com's senior director.   ""We are trying to push people who have gotten lazy and comfortable with an email service that may not be all that great and help show them what email can really do for them,"" said Mehta. (Read More: Microsoft to Crush Google's Android?)  By Microsoft's own admission, Hotmail had lost the competitive edge that once made it the world's largest email service. The lack of innovation left an opening for Google to exploit when it unveiled Gmail nearly nine years ago.   Gmail is now the industry leader, although estimates on its popularity vary.   Google says Gmail has more than 425 million accountholders, including those that only visit on smartphones and other mobile device. The latest data from research firm comScore, which doesn't include mobile traffic, shows Gmail with 306 million worldwide users through December, up 21 percent from the previous year. Yahoo's email ranked second with 293 million users, a 2 percent decrease from the previous year, followed by Hotmail at 267 million users, a 16 percent decline from the previous year.   Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., is counting on Outlook.com to catapult the company back to the top of the email heap. During the preview period, Outlook attracted 60 million accountholders, including about 20 million that defected from Gmail, according to Microsoft. Comscore listed Outlook with 38 million users through December.   The new features being introduced in Outlook include: the ability to send massive files, including hundreds of photos at a time, in a single email; address books that automatically update new contact information that connections post on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn; and about 60 percent fewer ads than Hotmail.   None of these features are revolutionary. Google already has been giving its users the option to switch to a new version of Gmail that also allows for larger files to be sent in a single email. And address books in Gmail already fetch new contact information posted on Google Plus, although it doesn't yet mine Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.   Google declined to comment on Outlook.com. The company, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., plans to convert all of its Gmail users to its redesigned format within the next few months.   (Read More: Supply Shortage Sours Microsoft's Surface Pro Launch)  Yahoo, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif. revamped its email service late last year in an effort to provide a more consistent experience on personal computers and mobile devices.   Outlook.com is the latest in a series of major product leases from Microsoft, which has been struggling to regain the cachet that once made it the world's most valuable technology company.   Now, both Apple and Google are worth more because they have been growing far faster than Microsoft as their products win more fans. Apple's biggest gains have come from the iPhone and IPad, while Google has been benefiting from its dominance in Internet search and its widely used Android software for mobile devices.   Microsoft has been trying to catch up with a major makeover of its Windows operating system, new smartphone software and a tablet computer called Surface. Like Outlook.com, all those products have been backed by expensive marketing campaigns in recent months. "

1154,2013-02-11T12:30:08-0500," Microsoft's Surface Pro made its debut over the weekend, but many consumers were disappointed when they realized retailers didn't have the new tablets in stock.    Microsoft officially launched the upgraded Intel-powered tablet on Saturday at select retailers and online in the U.S. and Canada, but it seems the tech giant didn't have adequate supply of the 128 GB model in time for the roll out.    Unlike the ARM-based Surface RT tablet, which was released several months ago, consumers were not given the choice to pre-order a 64 GB or 128 GB Surface Pro tablet. So instead, many consumers made the trek to local retailers—like Best Buy, Staples and Microsoft retail stores—to purchase the new tablet. But consumers were sent packing after they were told the tablets had already sold out.  ""Customer response to the launch of Surface Pro has been amazing. We're working with our retail partners who are currently out of stock of the 128GB Surface Pro to replenish supplies as quickly as possible. Our priority is to ensure that every customer gets their new Surface Pro as soon as possible,"" the company said in blog post.But, consumers took to the Surface blog to vent their frustrations about the supply shortage calling for answers from Microsoft about when they can get their hands on the Surface Pro. Some customers posted about their personal experience in trying to buy the new tablet, reporting that some of the retailers they visited only had several units of the 128 GB model.   ""At a minimum at least allow back ordering so those of us actively wanting to purchase a 128gb Surface Pro can gain our rightful place in line.  The lack of being unable to back order or MS being unable to provide an expected available date insinuates a serious supply problem,"" one commenter with the alias Cschofield65 said.   Another commenter by the username of Aryann posted, ""Just give a date when the 128gb unit will be available."" "
1155,2013-02-07T10:17:40-0500,"Software makers Microsoft and Symantec said they disrupted a global cyber crime operation by shutting down servers that controlled hundreds of thousands of PCs without the knowledge of their users.  The move made it temporarily impossible for infected PCs around the world to search the web, though the companies offered free tools to clean machines through messages that were automatically pushed out to infected computers.  Technicians working on behalf of both companies raided data centers in Weehawken, New Jersey, and Manassas, Virginia, on Wednesday, accompanied by U.S. federal marshals, under an order issued by the U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia.  They seized control of one server at the New Jersey facility and persuaded the operators of the Virginia data center to take down a server at their parent company in the Netherlands, according to Richard Boscovich, assistant general counsel with Microsoft's Digital Crimes Unit.  Boscovich told Reuters that he had ""a high degree of confidence"" that the operation had succeeded in bringing down the cyber crime operation, known as the Bamital botnet.  ""We think we got everything, but time will tell,"" he said.  The servers that were pulled off line on Wednesday had been used to communicate with what Microsoft and Symantec estimate are between 300,000 and 1 million PCs currently infected with malicious software that enslaved them into the botnet.  Hijacking Searches  The companies said that the Bamital operation hijacked search results and engaged in other schemes that the companies said fraudulently charge businesses for online advertisement clicks.  Bamital's organizers also had the ability to take control of infected PCs, installing other types of computer viruses that could engage in identity theft, recruit PCs into networks that attack websites and conduct other types of computer crimes.  Now that the servers have been shut down, users of infected PCs will be directed to a site informing them that their machines are infected with malicious software when they attempt to search the web.  Microsoft and Symantec are offering them free tools to fix their PCs and restore access to web searches via messages automatically pushed out to victims.  The messages warn: ""You have reached this website because your computer is very likely to be infected by malware that redirects the results of your search queries. You will receive this notification until you remove the malware from your computer.""  It was the sixth time that Microsoft has obtained a court order to disrupt a botnet since 2010. Previous operations have targeted bigger botnets, but this is the first where infected users have received warnings and free tools to clean up their machines.  Microsoft runs a Digital Crimes Unit out of its Redmond, Washington, headquarters that is staffed by 11 attorneys, investigators and other staff who work to help law enforcement fight financial crimes and exploitation of children over the web.  Symantec approached Microsoft about a year ago, asking the maker of Windows software to collaborate in trying to take down the Bamital operation. Last week they sought a court order to seize the Bamital servers.  The two companies said they conservatively estimate that the Bamital botnet generated at least $1 million a year in profits for the organizers of the operation. They said they will learn more about the size of the operation after they analyze information from infected machines that check in to the domains once controlled by Bamital's servers.  Their complaint identified 18 ""John Doe"" ringleaders, scattered from Russia and Romania to Britain, the United States and Australia, who registered websites and rented servers used in the operation under fictitious names. The complaint was filed last week with a federal court in Alexandria and unsealed on Wednesday.  The complaint alleges that the ringleaders made money through a scheme known as ""click fraud"" in which criminals get cash from advertisers who pay websites commissions when their users click on ads.  Bamital redirected search results from Google, Yahoo and Microsoft's Bing search engines to sites with which the authors of the botnet have financial relationships, according to the complaint.  The complaint also charges that Bamital's operators profited by forcing infected computers to generate large quantities of automated ad clicks without the knowledge of PC users.  Symantec researcher Vikram Thakur said Bamital is just one of several major botnets in a complex underground ""click fraud ecosystem"" that he believes generates at least tens of millions of dollars in revenue.  He said that researchers at will comb the data on the servers in order to better understand how the click fraud ecosystem works and potentially identify providers of fraudulent ads and traffic brokers.  ""This is just the tip of the iceberg in the world of click fraud,"" said Thakur.  Boscovich said he believes the botnet originated in Russia or Ukraine because affiliated sites install a small text file known as a cookie that is written in Russian on infected computers.  The cookie file contains the Russian phrase ""yatutuzebil,"" according to the court filing. That can loosely be translated as ""I was here,"" he said.  Microsoft provided details on the takedown operation on its blog: here "
1156,2013-02-06T10:25:48-0500,"   U.S. tech writers have given Microsoft new Surface tablet-laptop hybrid largely negative reviews, casting a shadow over the software group's hopes to take a bite out of sales of Apple iPad and MacBook Air.  The latest Surface runs on an Intel  chip and features the full Windows 8 Pro operating system, which Microsoft hopes will make the device attractive to people who want to produce as well as consume material.  It also hopes to appeal to businesses who want to give employees lightweight, mobile machines that fit easily into their technology and security infrastructure.  The ""Surface with Windows 8 Pro"", as it is officially called, is available from Saturday. Windows co-chief Tami Reller said earlier this week it is a key part of revving up interest in Windows 8, launched last October but which has not gripped consumers' imaginations.  The Surface Pro is thicker, heavier and several hundred dollars more expensive than the first Surface RT, which runs on an ARM Holdings Plc-designed chip and is not compatible with old Microsoft programs.  Available in 64 and 128 gigabyte versions, both with wifi-only connectivity, the Surface Pro starts at $899, excluding a $120-plus keyboard. That is $200 more expensive than a comparable iPad and closer in price to the 64 GB MacBook Air laptop at $999.  Microsoft has said the device is the first to bring a full operating system to the tablet format without compromising quality. But reviewers found the device uncomfortably stranded between a tablet and a PC, with many compromises.  ""It ran all the software I threw at it — both the new type and the old desktop type — speedily and well,"" wrote Walt Mossberg on the All Things D tech blog.  ""But the Pro has some significant downsides, especially as a tablet ... It's too hefty and costly and power-hungry to best the leading tablet, Apple's full-size iPad. It is also too difficult to use in your lap. It's something of a tweener - a compromised tablet and a compromised laptop.""  Mossberg said the Surface lasted less than four hours on his standard battery test, half the performance of an iPad. He also expressed concerns about the usable memory on the 64 GB version.Not As Good  ""The Pro is definitely snappier and more 'performant' (to use a bit of Microspeak),"" wrote Mary Jo Foley on the ZDNet tech blog.  However, she added: ""I keep scratching my head over who Microsoft expects to buy the Surface Pro. It's not as good of a tablet, in terms of weight/battery life, as the Surface RT is. But it's also not as good of a Windows 8 PC as other OEM-produced devices, coming in at lower price points with better battery life and other specs.""  Steve Kovach, writing for Business Insider, praised the specifications on the new Surface, but not the experience as a whole.  ""The Surface Pro has some impressive hardware specs for such a unique form factor. It can go toe-to-toe with any other thin and light laptop,"" he wrote.  ""(But) you can't rest the Surface Pro comfortably on your lap without it flopping around. You can't adjust the angle of the screen when it's propped on a table with the built-in kickstand,"" Kovach added.  ""You need to spend at least another $100 to get the full laptop-like experience with one of the special keyboard covers. At 10 inches, the screen feels a bit small for traditional desktop computing.  ""The cheapest model only has 23 GB of free storage, so you'll have to buy a separate memory card because you'll definitely need more than that.""  David Pierce, writing on The Verge tech news site, singled out the high quality of the screen, quick startup time, the USB port on the charging hub and pressure-sensitive stylus.  But he criticized the lack of Microsoft's Office suite of applications - which have to be purchased separately - and its general awkwardness.  ""Even a well-executed Surface still doesn't work for me, and I'd bet it doesn't work for most other people either,"" Pierce wrote.  ""It's really tough to use on anything but a desk, and the wide, 16:9 aspect ratio pretty severely limits its usefulness as a tablet anyway,"" Pierce added.  ""It's too big, too fat, and too reliant on its power cable to be a competitive tablet, and it's too immutable to do everything a laptop needs to do.

1157,2013-01-24T16:27:00-0500,"  Software giant Microsoft reported quarterly earnings that were a penny higher than Wall Street's forecasts and revenue that was just shy of what analysts had expected on Thursday despite a lift from its latest version of Windows.   After the earnings announcement, the company's shares slipped in after-hours trading. (Click here to get the latest quotes for Microsoft.)   Microsoft earned $6.4 billion, or 76 cents per share, during its fiscal second quarter. That was down from $6.6 billion, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier.   Revenue increased 3 percent to $21.46 billion from $20.89 billion a year ago.  In the report, Microsoft said its server and tools business revenue grew 9 percent while its business division revenue fell 10 percent from the prior-year period.   Analysts had expected the company to report earnings excluding items of 75 cents a share on $21.53 billion in revenue, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.   Amid an increasingly competitive landscape, Microsoft has pinned its hopes for personal computer sales on the launch of its new Windows 8 system.    The results announced Thursday are the first to include Windows 8. The program is a dramatic overhaul of the Microsoft operating system that powers most PCs. Windows 8 came out Oct. 26 with slightly more than two months left in Microsoft's fiscal second quarter.  Although the Windows 8 sales haven't been as impressive as investors hoped, revenue in Microsoft's Windows division climbed 24 percent from the previous year.    Microsoft said it had licensed more than 60 million copies of Windows 8. That puts the redesigned system on the same early sales trajectory as its predecessor, Windows 7, after it came out in 2009.   Investors have already signaled their disappointment with Windows 8 and Surface. The Redmond, Wash., company's stock is hovering around the same price as when those products were released three months ago, while the overall market has climbed higher.   So far, tech earnings results have been mixed. On Tuesday, IBM earnings and revenue exceeded Wall Street's expectations while Apple fell short of revenue forecasts on Wednesday, sending the already bruised stock even lower in trading on Thursday.

1158,2013-01-25T14:26:12-0500,"  As the enterprise market begins to ramp up its purchases of Microsoft's new Windows 8 operating system, one analyst sees the tech giant's shares gaining traction.   ""The stock's kind of a sneaky long — nobody likes it, but it keeps kind of drifting higher,"" Rick Sherlund, a managing director at Nomura Securities, said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""  Sherlund has a ""buy"" rating and a $32 price target on Microsoft stock. On Thursday, the company edged above Wall Street's earnings forecasts but missed revenue estimates.   ""I kind of have to apologize to people that I'm recommending it, which is a good sign probably that a lot of bad news is already out on the stock,"" he said.   So far, the results for Windows 8 orders have been soft, he said, adding that it's unclear how many of them are upgrades from Windows 7 for only $15 and how many are shipments with new machines, which would command a higher price.   ""Windows 8 will probably resonate better in the enterprise market"" than among consumers who don't really need Office, he said. And as enterprises begin to buy the product for their employees, Sherlund thinks ""that's when the stock starts to gain a little more traction.""    While Sherlund does not think it is important that Microsoft succeeds in hardware, it is important that their partners do. One concern though is the risk of Google's  Android commoditizing the tablet market.  ""I'm not so concerned about Apple as much as just the whole market getting commoditized and making it very difficult in the tablet market,"" he said. ""And so on the consumer side, I think that's a real tough market for Microsoft. If you don't need Office, then you really don't need to pay a premium for their products.""   Microsoft's latest earnings report comes days after a source close to the matter told CNBC that the company is in talks with Silver Lake Partners and Dell's CEO Michael Dell to invest $1 billion to $3 billion in a leveraged buyout of the personal computer maker.   Sherlund said he's seen Microsoft engage in strategic investments that are not necessarily intended for a direct return. Through these deals, the company has nurtured its ecosystems and helped its partners, he said.   ""Microsoft generates that much cash in a month or two, so it's just not important to me as an investor,"" he said. ""If they park $2 billion or $3 billion in Dell stock for a while and help out a partner, hopefully they'll get some strategic benefit of keeping Dell viable as an important partner of theirs.""   — Written by CNBC's Katie Little.

1160,2013-01-24T17:49:35-0500,"  On Thursday after the bell, Microsoft released earnings and results left Wall Street fairly underwhelmed.  The software giant reported a dip in fiscal second-quarter profit on Thursday, as weaker sales of its Xbox game system in the holiday quarter offset a solid start for its new Windows 8 operating system.  However, OptionMonster Jon Najarian isn't concerned by the weakness. He isolated a data point in the Microsoft release that he finds bullish for the stock broadly.

Trader Keith McCullough, CEO of Hedgeye Risk Management, isn't so sure. He said that the market is trading in a way that isn't terribly intuitive.

1161,2013-01-22T13:00:50-0500," Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer is not the right leader for the world's largest software company but holds his grip on it by systematically forcing out any rising manager who challenges his authority, claims a former senior executive who has written a book about his time at the company.  ""For Microsoft to really get back in the game seriously, you need a big change in management,"" said Joachim Kempin, who worked at Microsoft between 1983 and 2002, overseeing the sales of Windows software to computer makers for part of that time. ""As much as I respect Steve Ballmer, he may be part of that in the end.""  As a senior vice president in charge of a crucial part of the company's business with direct access to co-founder Bill Gates, Kempin is the most senior former Microsoft executive to write a book critical of the company, which is famous for the loyalty of its ex-employees.  His criticism echoes that of investor David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who called for Ballmer to step down in 2011.  Kempin left Microsoft under a cloud in 2002 as some of the aggressive contracts he crafted with PC makers were seen as fodder for the U.S. government's antitrust prosecution of the company, which started in 1998 and was largely resolved by 2002.  His book, titled 'Resolve and Fortitude: Microsoft's ""secret power broker"" breaks his silence', is scheduled to be published on Tuesday. He talked with Reuters by phone on Monday.  Defend the Throne  Kempin charges Ballmer with purposefully ousting any executives with potential to wrest him from the CEO seat, which he has occupied since 2000.  He said he saw the process first with Richard Belluzzo, a former Hewlett-Packard executive credited with launching the Xbox game console who rose to chief operating officer at Microsoft but left after only 14 months in the post, in the same year Kempin left.  ""He (Belluzzo) had no room to breathe on the top. When you work that directly with Ballmer and Ballmer believes 'maybe this guy could someday take over from me', my God, you will have less air to breathe, that's what it comes down to.""  Microsoft representatives declined comment. Attempts to reach Belluzzo were not successful.  Several leading executives, touted by outsiders at one time or another as potential successors to Ballmer, have left the company in the last few years, most recently Windows unit chief Steven Sinofsky, who departed in November.  Before Sinofsky, Windows and online head Kevin Johnson went to run Juniper Networks Inc, Office chief Stephen Elop went to lead phone maker Nokia Oyj, while Ray Ozzie, the software guru Gates designated as Microsoft's big-picture thinker, left to start his own project.  ""Ozzie is a great software guy, he knew what he was doing. But when you see Steve (Ballmer) and him on stage where he (Ozzie) opposed Steve, it was Steve's way or the highway,"" said Kempin.  Kempin said he spoke to Ballmer around two years ago and expressed his concerns about his management style and direction of the company, but has seen no changes since. He said he sent Ballmer and Gates copies of his new book but has yet to get a reply.  ""Steve is a very good business guy, but make him a chief operating officer, not a CEO, and your business is going to go gangbusters,"" said Kempin. ""I respect that guy (Ballmer), but there are some limitations in what he can and can't do and maybe he hasn't realized them himself.""  Missed Opportunities  In his book, Kempin writes about how Microsoft foresaw the major moves in technology in the last decade, but bungled its entry into tablets, phones and social media, ceding leadership in the technology world to Apple Inc and others.  ""They missed all the opportunities they were talking about when I was still in the company. Tablets, phones...we had a tablet going, we had tablet software when Windows XP came out, it was never followed up properly,"" said Kempin.  He also claims the decline of PCs is partly due to Microsoft's mismanagement of hardware makers, an area that Kempin oversaw at Microsoft.  ""Just think about the insult of Microsoft coming out with a tablet themselves, trying to mimic Apple, and now they are going to come out with a notebook on top of it,"" said Kempin, referring to Microsoft's Surface RT tablet and soon-to-be-released Surface running Windows Pro.  Several PC makers went public with their unease about Microsoft's decision to make its own computers last year.  Kempin reserves his most pointed criticism for Ballmer.  ""Is he a great CEO? I don't think so. Microsoft's board is a lame duck board, has been forever. They hire people to help them administer the company, but not to lead the company. That's the problem,"" said Kempin.  ""They need somebody maybe 35-40 years old, a younger person who understands the Facebook  generation and this mobile community. They don't need this guy on stage with this fierce, aggressive look, announcing the next version of Windows and thinking he can score with that."" "

1164,2018-11-21T09:14:17-0500,"Google poured resources into its cloud unit during Diane Greene's three-year run at the helm, but the company has still struggled against Amazon and Microsoft.Greene clashed with Google CEO Sundar Pichai over a big cloud contract with the Department of Defense.Thomas Kurian, a former Oracle executive, has been named as Greene's successor.When Google CEO Sundar Pichai handed Diane Greene the keys to the company's fledgling cloud business three years ago, it was supposed to mark the internet company's arrival into enterprise computing.For years, Google had struggled to get out of its own way in business software, hamstrung by a developer-centric culture that prioritized automation and fast, easy-to-use products over communication with business buyers and users. The huge profit margins in the online advertising business made it hard to justify loading up on expensive salespeople and marketing campaigns.So while Google was dithering alongside a large group of also-rans, Amazon Web Services was running away with cloud computing. Microsoft deftly moved into second place by pivoting its traditional software licensing business to a subscription-based cloud-first model.Greene was meant to change all that. She brought with her serious enterprise credentials as the co-founder and first CEO of VMware. In some sense, VMware helped kick off the cloud revolution by pioneering a technology called ""virtualization,"" which allowed the operators of data centers to squeeze more functionality out of the server hardware they bought and maintained. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has said ""there's no more successful female executive in Silicon Valley"" than Greene.Pichai wrote in his introductory blog post in November 2015 that ""Diane needs no introduction."" She would get her own dedicated sales team, pulling cloud software sales out from under the control of the core advertising business.On Friday, that plan came to an abrupt halt when Greene announced that she will leave her post in January. Greene will be replaced by Thomas Kurian, who recently left a top executive role at Oracle, where he spent 22 years.During Greene's tenure, Google increased its annual capital expenditures from $10 billion to over $13 billion, and went on a hiring spree — the cloud group has added more people than any other at Alphabet over the last two years. It got some key customer wins and built out several important functions for selling to enterprises, including professional services, training and marketing.Despite all that, Google continues to struggle. People who follow the industry say it's a two-horse race between Amazon and Microsoft, with Google failing to keep pace in a cloud infrastructure market that Gartner expects to grow to $39.5 billion next year from $31 billion in 2018. In terms of market share, Google has yet to crack double digits.""They figured out and monetized search like nobody probably ever will, but I don't think they care about the enterprise,"" said Tom Siebel, the co-founder of software company Siebel Systems, which Oracle acquired for almost $6 billion in 2006. Siebel, who has known Greene for about 15 years and is now CEO of cloud software company C3, said that when it comes to helping big businesses solve their infrastructure problems, ""Google is just not a factor.""Greene put a positive spin on last week's announcement, saying that she was among the Google employees to interview Kurian for the job, along with Pichai and Urs Hoelzle, Google's eighth employee, who serves as senior vice president of technical infrastructure.Greene also said that when she took the position in 2015, she told family and friends that it would be for only two years.One big challenge for Google's cloud business has been an unclear direction, highlighted by tension between Pichai and Greene, according to former employees and other people with knowledge of their relationship who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the topic.It's been particularly awkward because both executives are also on Alphabet's board. Greene has been a director since 2012, three years before Google acquired her software company, Bebop, and installed her to lead the cloud business. Pichai, a 14-year Google veteran, didn't join Alphabet's board until 2017.Two former employees described a recent disagreement between the two over a controversial contract with the Department of Defense, dubbed Project Maven. After employees and outsiders called on Google Cloud Platform to cancel the contract, Pichai wanted to listen to the protestors, the people said.Greene initially resisted these calls, however, as the project was both a lucrative deal and an important on-ramp to future government work, regardless of its effect on Google's reputation or employee morale.CNBC requested comment from Greene, but Google didn't grant access. Google declined to provide a statement beyond Greene's blog post announcing her departure.Eventually, the company decided not to renew the contract. Google then established ""ethical principles"" for the use of artificial intelligence, which forbids Google from developing AI for use in weapons but allows the company to pursue military contracts in other areas such as ""cybersecurity, training, military recruitment, veterans' healthcare, and search and rescue."" Greene and Pichai were in tight agreement when it came to the drafting of these principles, a person familiar with the process says.Greene also provoked opposition as the cloud sales strategy evolved.Tariq Shaukat, president of partner and industry platforms in the cloud business, told CNBC that representatives under Greene have increasingly been joining other Google teams, like advertising and maps, in potential customer conversations. ""We're finding a lot of demand from customers and success with going in as one Google team,"" he said.However, Greene's efforts to make other Google business partnerships contingent on some kind of business with the cloud unit frustrated other department chiefs, people briefed on those discussions told The Information.Google's lack of big deals has puzzled analysts given how aggressive the major software vendors have been at opening their wallets to win in the cloud. In two of the year's biggest deals — IBM's $34 billion purchase of Red Hat and Microsoft's $7.5 billion acquisition of GitHub — Google was involved in talks but ultimately came up short, according to people familiar with the matter.Greene wanted to buy GitHub but Pichai was less enthusiastic, unclear why Google would spend big money to get into the market for developer tools, said a person close to the business. Google's bid for GitHub, whose cloud software lets programmers collaborate and share code, came in at just under $6 billion, and it declined to raise the price after being told of Microsoft's offer, the person said.Some people in the cloud group pushed for Google to pursue MuleSoft, which was acquired by Salesforce for $6.5 billion in March, but Greene wasn't interested, the person said. MuleSoft's software helps connect applications that are on disparate platforms. Google already owns Apigee, a MuleSoft competitor, which it purchased in 2016.Red Hat and GitHub would have brought in large open-source communities that could have helped evangelize Google's cloud platform to developers inside companies, potentially leading to more adoption.But they wouldn't have solved a deeper problem — how to start selling like an enterprise software vendor.""Google just needs to buy a company that gives them a really good start building a global enterprise capability,"" said Frank Slootman, former CEO of cloud software company ServiceNow and Data Domain, which he sold to EMC.Google is an engineering machine. It's the world's best-capitalized research lab, loaded up with Ph.D.s in artificial intelligence who are developing the technology that will define the future. People who aren't software engineers, including those in sales, can often feel like second-class citizens, according to former employees.At the time Greene joined, Google had little infrastructure for selling into businesses, and that function was controlled by the advertising unit. Numerous people who have dealt with Google's cloud salespeople over the last couple years told CNBC that while AWS and Microsoft are geared toward serving customers and responding quickly to their requests, Google touts its own technology, selling what it thinks clients need.Two former Google employees said that Greene was in a tenuous spot because, among Alphabet's top brass, there's little understanding for what it's like to sell to large businesses. Another ex-employee said one reason they left was because of Google's disconnect with customers.One person who might have helped figure out what enterprises need was Diane Bryant, who joined as Google's operating chief from Intel's data center business in November 2017. Bryant spent 13 years at Intel and has a broad set of skills across finance, technology and cybersecurity. She was often discussed as CEO material. Bryant did not respond to requests for comment.But Greene, who is considered a product visionary, has a reputation of being hard to work with dating back to her days at VMware, multiple people said. Jerry Chen, an investor at Greylock Partners who worked for Greene at VMware, said that his former boss ""pushed her team to think bigger,"" and that while she challenged him, he became a better executive for it.At Google, Greene and Bryant clashed almost from the beginning, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Bryant ended up with the limited roles of running support and information technology, two people said, and lasted only seven months at the company.Still, Google made progress under Greene, winning at least pieces of the public cloud business from numerous companies, including Apple, PayPal, Etsy, Evernote, Fitbit, HubSpot, Shopify, Twitter and Zendesk.""We went from people not even knowing that this was an area where Google had an offering, to essentially now, every time that people talk about cloud, they talk about the big three,"" said Alison Wagonfeld, Google Cloud's marketing chief.Google is playing squarely into the emerging multicloud theme, vying to provide services to companies that don't want to be wed to a single provider. For example, Google has won business from some Amazon cloud customers, like Salesforce and The New York Times.Benioff told CNBC that ""Google is now an enterprise player, there's no doubt about that."" He attributes that position to Greene and said that while Google needs to ramp up its hiring in sales to catch up with its rivals, ""in many accounts, they've shown up extremely competitively.""But frequently you'll hear stories like the one told by Workday's David Clarke.In 2016, months into Greene's tenure, the finance and human resources software vendor considered Google when it was picking out a preferred public cloud. But it passed and chose AWS instead. At the time, Google was in the early stages of commercializing its cloud, said Clarke, Workday's senior vice president of technology and infrastructure.""They hadn't thought through all the operational, economic and practical requirements that companies, especially bigger companies, would have,"" Clarke said in an interview. He said that Google has improved since then and if he were making the decision today it would be ""a close call.""Autodesk, which has used Amazon's cloud for years, turned to the Google cloud for one initiative in 2016. But the company stuck with Amazon for primary workloads, a person familiar with the matter said. And Zendesk announced an application-development platform last week but chose to launch it on AWS.""If you analyze the depth of their [Google's] stack globally, for example, it's leaner than AWS can offer,"" said Mikkel Svane, Zendesk's CEO. ""That's one example of where they [AWS] stand out.""In 2017, Google held just 3.3 percent of the overall worldwide cloud infrastructure market, according to Gartner Research. While Google picked up share from the prior year, it was still behind way behind AWS and Microsoft and trailed Alibaba.It doesn't help that Google has become less transparent of late about the size of its cloud business. In February, the company said that between Google Cloud Platform and the G Suite bundle of productivity apps for businesses, it was generating more than $1 billion in revenue per quarter. But since then — nothing.Kurian's hire is a clear sign that Google still recognizes the importance of capturing big dollars from enterprises as they move from traditional data centers to the cloud, and that it still has a compelling story to tell about how businesses can take advantage of Google's sophisticated technology.There are big retailers and other large businesses that would rather not funnel more money to Amazon, leaving Google to compete with Microsoft for the bulk of those workloads.In a note to clients on Sunday, Deutsche Bank analysts estimated that the Google Cloud Platform and G Suite will pick up $9 billion in revenue this year, up 30 percent from last year. Another former employee with knowledge of the business painted a less rosy picture, estimating that the full cloud business will book nearly $7 billion this year.Regardless, as Greene said in February at a Goldman Sachs event, ""It's pretty clearly early days.""— CNBC's Ari Levy and Alex Sherman contributed to this report.WATCH: Greene: Google Cloud growing faster than any other"

Each of the companies, and several others, have come under scrutiny following disclosures in The Guardian and Washington Post newspapers of their role in a National Security Agency data collection program named Prism.      Google was the first to go public, releasing an open letter asking the U.S. Department of Justice Tuesday for permission to publish the total number of government requests for national security information, arguing the figures would show the company does not give the government ""unfettered access"" to its users' data.    ""Assertions in the press that our compliance with these requests gives the U.S. government unfettered access to our users' data are simply untrue,"" Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond wrote in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder and FBI Director Robert Mueller that was published on Google's public policy blog Tuesday.       Google's current transparency reports—which show the number of data requests it receives from authorities—do not include requests under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).       Microsoft issued a similar request soon after.       ""Permitting greater transparency on the aggregate volume and scope of national security requests, including FISA orders, would help the community understand and debate these important issues,"" Microsoft said in an emailed statement.       Leading social network Facebook followed within minutes.       ""We would welcome the opportunity to provide a transparency report that allows us to share with those who use Facebook around the world a complete picture of the government requests we receive, and how we respond,"" said Ted Ullyot, Facebook's general counsel, in an emailed statement. ""We urge the United States government to help make that possible by allowing companies to include information about the size and scope of national security requests we receive, and look forward to publishing a report that includes that information.""       Although President Barack Obama and senior U.S. intelligence officials have confirmed the existence of Prism, Google and other tech firms have vigorously denied that they give government agencies direct access to their servers or that it complies with overly broad requests for user data.

1168,2013-01-04T10:57:33-0500," Microsoft is making a last-ditch push to convince government regulators they need to crack down on Google to preserve competition on the Internet and in smartphone markets.   Microsoft laid out its arguments in a blog post Wednesday by Dave Heiner, the software maker's deputy general counsel.   Heiner mostly rehashed familiar ground, while depicting Google as a company that has abused its dominance of Internet search and leadership in online video to thwart its rivals to the detriment of consumers.   Heiner in the post described the FTC verdict as ""troubling."" The Windows maker went on to say, ""The FTC's overall resolution of this matter is weak and — frankly — unusual. We are concerned that the FTC may not have obtained adequate relief even on the few subjects that Google has agreed to address.""   (Read More: Google Pushed Hard Behinds the Scenes to Push Regulators)   Microsoft lobbed its missive as regulators in the U.S. and Europe wrap up wide-ranging investigations into Google's business practices.   After extensive negotiations with Google executives, resolutions of the probes are expected soon. Microsoft is worried Google will reach settlements that won't require major changes.   On Thursday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission closed its investigation against Google for antitrust violations. The FTC concluded there was no evidence of search results manipulation. (Read More: FTC Finds Google Does Not Unfairly Favor its Own Services)   The focus now is on Europe. ""The good news is that other antitrust agencies, within the United States and overseas, are still examining Google's conduct,"" said Microsoft's Heiner in the blog post. ""We remain hopeful that these agencies will stick to their established procedures, ensure transparency, and obtain the additional relief needed to address the serious competition law concerns that remain."""
1169,2018-11-27T00:04:25-0500,"Amazon Web Services is launching computing instances that draw on server chips that use Arm's processing architecture, which could provide cheaper options for customers.Earlier this year AWS announced computing instances based on AMD chips, which are available alongside Intel-based instances.AWS generated 46 percent revenue growth in the third quarter, while Amazon's online stores had 10 percent growth.Amazon's cloud business is coming out with cheaper computing options, thanks to server chips that use the energy-efficient Arm processing architecture.Amazon Web Services, the clear market leader for public cloud infrastructure, is the first of the big cloud providers to launch Arm-based computing resources. Microsoft, Google, IBM and other companies compete with Amazon to provide public cloud infrastructure, which companies rely on to store their data and run their applications.Across these clouds — and in corporate on-premises data centers — customers' computing workloads often run on Intel-based chips. But SoftBank-owned Arm, whose technology is widely used for chips in smartphones and tablets, has long been thought of as a potential alternative that could run while using less energy, which could lead to lower costs.AWS' EC2 A1 computing instances rely on the Arm-based Graviton processor from Annapurna, AWS' chip-development group, Peter DeSantis, the group's vice president of global infrastructure and customer support, said during a keynote presentation at the AWS Reinvent user conference in Las Vegas on Monday. For certain workloads, like web servers, costs could be as much as 45 percent lower, DeSantis said.Amazon bought Annapurna in 2015. Earlier, Amazon hired several people from Calxeda, a start-up that was working on Arm-based server systems.While commerce still generates most of Amazon's revenue, AWS has become critical to the company's financial health. In the third quarter more than half of Amazon's operating profit came from AWS. While revenue from Amazon's online stores increased 10 percent year over year in the quarter, AWS had revenue growth of 46 percent. AWS now has more than 125 services available to customers, including the core EC2 computing service. The A1 instances are available now from four of AWS' data center regions around the world.Earlier this year AWS announced the introduction of computing instances that use servers containing AMD chips.Last year Microsoft demonstrated its Windows Server operating system running on Arm servers, but Arm-based computing is not currently possible from Microsoft's Azure public cloud."
1170,2013-01-03T10:20:15-0500,"  Microsoft bought start-up id8 Group R2 Studios Inc as it looks to expand further in technology focused on the home and entertainment, a person familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.  id8 Group R2 Studios was started in 2011 by Silicon Valley entrepreneur and investor Blake Krikorian. It recently launched a Google Android application to allow users to control home heating and lighting systems from smartphones.  Krikorian's Sling Media—which was sold to EchoStar Communications in 2007— made the ""Slingbox"" for watching TV on computers.  Krikorian will join Microsoft with a small team, according to the Wall Street Journal, which reported the acquisition earlier on Wednesday. Microsoft also purchased some patents owned by the start-up related to controlling electronic devices, the newspaper added.   Krikorian and a Microsoft spokesman declined to comment.   Krikorian resigned from Amazon.com board in late December after about a year and a half as a director at the company, the Internet's largest retailer. "
1171,2013-06-04T08:10:07-0400,"   Call it the return of Wintel.  Hallelujah! That old amalgamation of Windows and Intel that ruled the market in the '90s is back to work.   Never mind that the rise from the rubble of old, uncool tech isn't being fueled by the PC partnership they once were. All that matters is that their stocks have been outperforming the broader S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 over the past one, three and six month periods.   The best part: They're so old, slow, plodding and uncool they've become trendy.  Somewhere someone must be thinking that this is a sure sign we're witnessing the last hurrah of this leg of what appears to be an unstoppable bull market.  Maybe it is, but the bigger point is that each company is rising on its own merits: Microsoft on slightly improved results, but more importantly -- indications the company is getting serious about bowing to shareholder pressure to reshuffle the executive decks and, perhaps, the entire corporation; Intel on new chips for mobile, with its notable win as chip supplier for Samsung's Galaxy Tab 3.  On top of that, because they're big, liquid and easy to trade, they get juiced further as the unlikeliest of short-squeezes. That's right: As as their shares have crept higher, they've climbed to the top of the listing of the most heavily shorted stocks on on the Nasdaq as hedge funds piled into what would appear to have been safe shorts.   But there's something else that has been ignored: Unlike so many tech companies, including Facebook, Salesforce and Amazon, what you see with their results is what you get. As Andrew Bary reported in Barron's over the weekend, Microsoft and Intel are among a small number (including Apple) that report results on a GAAP basis. No smoke-and-mirrors of trying to pretend stock-based compensation (a.k.a. options) are not routine expenses associated with doing business.  The GAAP vs. non-GAAP tug-of-war has been a recurring and largely ignored argument for years, but it's an important one that often gets buried in the momentum of the stocks and their stories.  Bernsten Research's Toni Saccanaghi reignited the issue last month in a report that audaciously asked, ""How much free cash flow is really free?""  It's an excellent question. Trouble is, in Silicon Valley, nobody talks free cash flow.   It is and always has been about the product, the story and then, if and when all else fails, the quality of the numbers.  For many these companies operating expenses are growing faster than revenue. The options. The daycare. The massages. They all get lumped in somewhere on the income statement as a buried but big cost. Investors look the other way as long as the stocks are performing like a hare.  In wacky markets like these, however —when the irrational mantra is to invest in stocks for the sole reason than there is no other place else to put your money—it's hard not to root for the tortoise.

1172,2012-12-07T13:29:15-0500,"  Google's growing its enterprise software business and Microsoft—which has long-dominated the business software market with its Windows products—has a reason to be nervous, Brent Thill, an analyst for UBS, told CNBC.    ""There's no question the competitor barrier has come down,"" Thill said. ""There's a collision coming and the question is who can move into the other's camp.""   Microsoft Windows has been the major player in the enterprise software space for years, tailoring its services for large businesses. Google's software apps, though, have been widely adopted by consumers and small businesses. Now both companies want a piece of each other's pie, and while it's unlikely Google apps will be a Windows killer, Microsoft still better take heed, Thill said.   ""Never say never, however, I don't think you are going to see a mass change overnight,"" Thill said. ""I think Google's onto something. Microsoft is definitely more concerned... Google is changing the game and Microsoft is going to have to adapt...Microsoft follows, they don't lead."" The search giant took another step Thursday in growing its revenue from its enterprise apps service when it announced that it would start charging companies of all sizes to use its apps—including Gmail—for work. (Previously, the company only charged business with 10 or more employees.)   Thill said Google's move to start charging all businesses for its apps software seems the logical step considering it had to offer its services for free in the beginning to entice people to try its products. However, just because all-size businesses are now being charged doesn't mean that Google's enterprise software is necessarily cut out to support larger businesses, Thill said.   ""It's certainly very compelling for Google. If you are doing very basic things, I think Google is going to be fine. But for larger enterprises, they will probably never go there, certainly not overnight,"" he said.    While Thill said the enterprise market is currently big enough for both companies to be successful, Microsoft better keep close tabs on Google because it has a track record of disrupting markets quickly.   Google's smartphone OS Android became the world's most widely used smartphone platform in just a few years after the first Android-powered phone launched and soon tablets running Google's OS are predicted to overtake Apple's iPad dominance.   ""They are planting seeds in mobile, small business, they're more proactive in voice technology, there's no question Google is spreading their wings into other technologies to field new levels of growth,"" Thill said. ""You give bigger credit to Google for disrupting the market. They have nothing to lose. Microsoft has no record of mixing things up,"""
1173,2012-12-11T18:05:03-0500,"  Microsoft will begin selling its Surface tablet at more retailers within days and is also planning on growing its own retail presence, the company said on Tuesday.    Previously, Microsoft has only sold its tablet in its own stores and on its website, but the company claims that growing interest among retailers has prompted them to allow the retailers to sell Surface tablets even sooner than planned.The company did not give specific dates as to when additional retailers would begin selling the tablet but said consumers in the U.S. and Australia can expect the device at more retailers in mid-December.   ""Our plan has been to expand the retail presence for Surface after the first of the year. Based on interest from retailers, we are giving them the option to carry Surface with Windows RT even earlier,"" said Steve Schueler, corporate vice president of Microsoft retail sales and marketing, in a company post.   Microsoft will also be turning some of its holiday pop-up stores into permanent Microsoft retailers, the company said.   While the company still hasn't said how many Surface tablets it's actually sold, Panos Panay the general manager for Microsoft Surface said that ""The public reaction to Surface has been exciting to see."""
1174,2018-12-03T10:18:59-0500,"AirPods are Apple’s most popular accessory ever, according to TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.Kuo says Apple will launch a new model in the first quarter of next year with wireless charging.He predicts Apple will ship 100 million to 110 million AirPods in 2021.Apple's wireless AirPods headphones could see massive growth over the next few years, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo wrote in a research note released last week. It's a positive sign for Apple as it seeks new growth areas that can help the company squeeze more revenue out of each iPhone user.Kuo, who has a track record of accurately predicting Apple product launches, said AirPods are Apple's most popular accessory ever.In the note, Kuo said Apple AirPods have the fastest growth momentum of any Apple product. Kuo estimates Apple will ship 26 million to 28 million AirPod units this year, up from 14 million to 16 million in 2017. Kuo also expects Apple to release a new version of AirPods next year with wireless charging that will help propel shipments to 50 million to 55 million units next year, 70 million to 80 million units in 2020 and 100 million to 110 million units in 2021.Apple does not disclose how many accessories such as AirPods and Apple Watches it sells, and lumps the revenue those products generate into its ""Other Products"" category.""Over 1 billion iPhone users worldwide offer great potential growth opportunities for AirPods,"" Kuo said. ""We believe that there is a greater likelihood of legacy iPhone users buying AirPods than upgrading to new iPhone models.""Apple's stock has taken a large hit over the last month, following a slew of reports that iPhone sales are falling below expectations. Apple also said last month that it will no longer report unit sales for the iPhone, which rattled investors. The rout caused Apple to lose its position as the largest U.S. public company by market cap to Microsoft on Friday."
1175,2018-11-26T08:29:53-0500,"Investors, including billionaire hedge fund managers, are afraid the bull market is coming to an end.Since January the S&amp;P 500 has fallen by 2.35 percent, its worst performance since 2008.Historically, investors have gravitated toward more defensive and commodity-focused sectors, such as energy, materials and utilities, in late cycles.Some experts believe this cycle will be different and that technology, health care and materials will offer the best opportunities in the fourth quarter.Is the bull run finally coming to an end? Many investors think so, including Steve Cohen, the billionaire hedge fund manager who said last week that we're in a late market cycle and returns over the next two years won't look so good. With the benefits of tax reform in the rearview mirror and with labor productivity slowing, others think that America's GDP, which expanded by 3.5 percent in the third quarter, will grow more slowly in 2019.For Jeff Mills, co-chief investment strategist at PNC Financial, that means adjusting his company's portfolios to take advantage of late-cycle opportunities — and to give more thought to what might happen when the bull becomes a bear. ""I don't think it's going to come to an abrupt end,"" he said, ""but growth will absolutely slow next year.""Investors may already be anticipating a turn of events despite strong third-quarter growth. Since January the S&amp;P 500 has fallen by 2.35 percent, its worst performance since the 2008 recession, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index is also down 2.17 percent on the year.The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust, which tracks the S&amp;P 500 and is the world's largest exchange-traded fund, with $256 billion in assets under management; and the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF, which has $22 billion in AUM, have dropped by 2.05 percent and 2.10 percent, respectively, year-to-date, according to S&amp;P Capital IQ.U.S. markets have struggled — the S&amp;P 500 and the DJIA fell on Friday by 0.66 percent and 0.73 percent, respectively, largely because of worries over trade wars and rising interest rates, said Kristina Hooper, Invesco's chief global market strategist. ""Tightening can potentially asphyxiate economic growth, and there's potential for trade wars to get worse,"" she said. ""Those two factors have impacted markets this fall.""Going forward, it's going to be harder for companies to generate the same kind of earnings as they have been, while these two risk factors could cause the economic cycle, which she said is in the midst of moving from a mid- to late-cycle, to end faster than expected. ""I still think the business cycle has some legs, but overtightening by central banks and trade wars could hasten the demise of the economic expansion,"" she said.Historically, investors have gravitated toward more defensive- and commodity-focused sectors in late cycles. The best-performing industries in 2007, for instance, were energy, materials and utilities, while consumer discretionary and real estate were two of the worst. However, Hooper said that because this cycle is so different from previous ones — it's going on nine years, and it was started by unprecedented monetary easing — old playbooks don't apply.Technology, which typically doesn't do as well later in the cycle, will keep outperforming, she said. Why? Because investors will be desperate for growth, and tech is one of the only sectors that's continuing to innovate and expand.However, it may not be the FAANGs — Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google — that lead the way. Some of these high-growth companies have tumbled recently, partly because of slowing user growth, privacy concerns and worries around possible regulation. All five stocks have fallen between 28 percent and 16 percent over the last three months. (Netflix has dropped the most, Google the least.)Still, there are opportunities as the cycle nears its end, she said, especially in cloud computing, AI and other innovative areas that continue to grow. ""You can't paint all of tech with the same brush,"" she said. ""Investors should be cautious with the FAANGS, but there are selective buying opportunities ... in areas like AI, cloud computing and fintech as valuations look more attractive given the sell-off, and growth potential is high.""PNC Financials' Mills is more partial to companies like Microsoft, Visa and Apple, even with the latter's underperformance. These companies have no debt and strong cash flows — net operating cash flow was $43 billion, $12 billion and $77 billion, respectively, at the end of their last fiscal years, according to NASDAQ — and should continue to do well as long as consumers continue to spend. (Investors can also take comfort in knowing that Warren Buffett still owns about $50 billion worth of Apple stock.)For ETF investors the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may be a good way to play the sector. It's the largest tech ETF by assets: $22 billion in AUM, and Apple, Microsoft and Visa are its top three holdings. It's up 3.2 percent year-to-date, too.Another late-cycle sector to consider is health care, said Mills. It's one of the only industries that's growth and defensive as people need to look after their health, regardless of the economic cycle, while new innovations are helping boost earnings.It's also cheaper than the broader market. The sector is trading at 15.9 times earnings, which is slightly below its historical average of 16 times earnings, and below the S&amp;P 500's 17 times earnings. He thinks there's still a slight chance that drug price controls get instituted, so he recommends being more diversified across the sector.Hooper is bullish on pharmaceuticals, biotech, hospitals and insurers. ""Pharmaceuticals are a very good place to be with relatively attractive valuations, strong fundamentals, attractive dividend yields,"" she said. ""Biotech also looks attractive and could benefit from M&amp;A activity, while hospitals and insurers should benefit from midterm elections, as a Democratic House should ensure the continued existence of the Affordable Care Act."" Analysts are keen on Pfizer and Merck in pharma and Biogen and Agios Pharma.Those who want that diversified exposure may want to consider the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund, the largest health-care ETF, with $18.8 billion in AUM. It's one of the best-performing health care ETFs, posting a 12.7 percent gain so far.Materials is another sector to consider said Hooper. While the Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF — the largest broad-based materials fund by AUM, with $4.4 billion in assets — is down 13.2 percent year-to-date, she believes the industry will pick up later in the cycle.China, with its Belt and Road initiative, is spending huge amounts on infrastructure, while President Donald Trump has said he wants to spend $1.5 trillion on infrastructure investments, with about $200 billion of that coming from the Federal government and the rest coming from state and city coffers. The government has reportedly doled out just $21 billion so far, but if spending picks up, then that will be a boon to materials stocks. ""[Materials] may be more of a safer bet than others,"" said Hooper.Two companies to consider, say analysts, are Martin Marietta, a maker of heavy building materials, and Nucor, the largest steelmaker in the United States.Even though the U.S. economy has been hot this year, growing by 4.2 percent in the second quarter and 3.5 percent in the third, the economic cycle could end faster than expected. On Sunday, Goldman Sachs said it thinks fourth-quarter growth will come in at 2.5 percent and then slow to 1.6 percent by Q4 2019.If the bull market does come to an end, a company like Apple would be a bad stock to own. ""As long as the economy is growing, even if it's slowly, then people will be paying attention to tech (and other growth sectors),"" said Mills. ""But there is a risk because as the economy moves into the next recession, tech could become one of the worst-performing sectors.""Investors will need to be more selective as the bull run nears it send, said Hooper — you will have to pick your sectors and your companies wisely — and be prepared for more volatility. ""We're in uncharted territory,"" she said. ""We've had an experimental monetary policy, and the potential for trade wars like we haven't seen since the 1930s. The playbook for sector performance doesn't entirely apply."""
1176,2012-12-06T15:45:44-0500,"Facebook is in negotiations with Microsoft about acquiring advertising technology that could allow the social network displays ads on other websites, broadly expanding its advertising business, according to media reports on Thursday.  Facebook is in ""serious"" discussions with Microsoft about a deal to purchase Atlas Solutions, an ad-serving product that Microsoft acquired through its $6 billion acquisition of aQuantive in 2007, according to reports in the technology blogs Business Insider and AllThingsDigital on Thursday.  The deal could allow Facebook to significantly expand its advertising business by showing ads on third-party websites, mounting a challenge to Google Inc's DoubleClick ad network, said the reports, which cited anonymous sources.  The potential price for the acquisition was unclear, though Business Insider said the highest bid for Atlas in Microsoft's previous attempts to sell the business was $30 million.  Facebook and Microsoft representatives declined to comment.    Facebook, the world's No. 1 online social network with roughly 1 billion users, has been moving aggressively to bolster its advertising business with new capabilities, including ads on mobile devices and features that demonstrate the effectiveness of its ads to marketers.  Facebook currently generates 86 percent of its revenue, which totaled roughly $1.3 billion in the third quarter, from ads that appear on its own website.

1178,2018-12-03T07:00:11-0500,"Six former Facebook employees who left the company within the last two years told CNBC they've experienced a rise in contact from current company employees to inquire about opportunities or ask for job references.The shift in behavior comes as Facebook deals with scandal after scandal while seeing a nearly 40 percent drop in its stock price from a peak in July.Some former Facebook employees say their phone is ringing a lot more in the last two months. On the other line: former Facebook colleagues asking about job openings or looking for a reference.This type of behavior is normal at most companies. But according to a half dozen former employees, all of whom left in the last year or two, it's a major change in behavior at Facebook, which had long been known around Silicon Valley as the company that no one leaves. These people requested anonymity as none is authorized by Facebook to talk about their time there or interactions with employees.The shift could be an early warning of recruiting and retention challenges for Facebook after a turbulent year. In 2018, the company has faced public questioning at multiple congressional hearings, scandals around third-party abuse of user data and public relations practicesand flat or declining user growth in key markets. It's also seen its stock drop nearly 40 percent from July.The stories from former employees are only anecdotal at this point, and there's no firm data showing a significant uptick in departures or employee dissatisfaction. On Glassdoor, a site where workers anonymously review their employers, Facebook is among the best-rated tech companies, with a satisfaction rating of 4.3 out of 5. However, that rating has fallen noticeably during the last year, with a particularly sharp drop in the last few months.Even if Facebook employees are starting to consider other options, that's not uncommon as hot tech companies mature. Around 2010, Google saw a wave of engineers and executives leave for greener pastures, including Facebook. Microsoft faced a similar exodus in the early 2000s, captured most saliently by the anonymous employee blog Mini-Microsoft.""Our retention rate continues to be very strong,"" said Anthony Harrison, a Facebook spokesman. ""Everyone at Facebook is focused on making a positive impact in the world, and on working on hard challenges that matter.""But several former employees who spoke to CNBC believe that the wave of scandals and falling stock price are spurring more people to consider leaving for the first time.""There's new things coming out every day,"" said one former company executive. ""It's a quite somber atmosphere right now at the company.""Employees have a tradition of posting photos of their badges on secret Facebook groups for alumni of the company when they quit, another former Facebook manager said.""I've been seeing a lot of badges lately,"" he said. This manager also said he'd heard recently from a couple of current Facebook employees, including one individual who has been with the company for more than seven years but expressed that he has finally burned out.""A lot of people want to do something different,"" he said. ""They're just burnt.""A former Facebook recruiter said he has heard from more than 30 current employees in the past year, including approximately 15 in the past two months. Most of these employees say ""'My manager sucks, and I need to look for something new. Do you know of any new opportunities?'"" the recruiter said.""They're coming to ask 'What are you seeing in the market across Silicon Valley?'"" the recruiter said.Some former employees cited a broader change in the culture as well. In the past year, the company has grown from nearly 23,200 employees in September 2017 to more than 33,600 employees a year later, according to the company's latest financial filings.With that growth has come increased bureaucracy and an increase in a top-down management style, one former Facebook manager said. Whereas previously Facebook had a start-up environment where colleagues felt everyone had each other's backs, there is now more politics and more grandstanding, another former manager said.""There's a lot of people who succeed more by how things looked than by the work they were doing, and there were people who were let go that were incredibly well-respected and it was because they weren't playing the politics game,"" one of the former managers said.One former Facebook engineer said he has been contacted by about a dozen Facebook employees since leaving the company this summer, saying they were thinking about leaving the company or inquiring what his experience has been like since his own departure. Just before speaking with CNBC, another Facebook employee called him to ask for advice on clearance for setting up a start-up while remaining at Facebook, this person said.""Overall, I've seen an uptick in people either looking for other activities or dipping their toes outside the Facebook pool,"" he said.In the past, Facebook employees who had been with the company for only a year or two but were unhappy with their roles were likely to request a team switch. Now, employees in that situation are simply looking to leave the company, the former engineer said.""This time around far more people are immediately jumping instead of switching teams,"" the former Facebook engineer said.Many of the employees calling former colleagues also ask for advice on the best way to leave Facebook, according to multiple former employees. This is because the company categorizes departing employees under one of two tags: ""regrettable"" or ""non-regrettable"" attrition.Being labeled as ""non-regrettable"" is the equivalent of getting blacklisted by Facebook and prevented from ever working there again. For anyone in Silicon Valley who wishes to work at a top company, getting a banned by Facebook cuts down job opportunities drastically.""The way you do it and the timing matters a lot, and it requires knowledge of the game,"" the former Facebook engineer said.""Once someone got one of these things ... it's like Voldemort,"" one of the former Facebook managers said. ""It's a name you can not say.""Another former Facebook director said he has seen a rise in the number of his ex-colleagues who have reached out to ask about openings at his current company, and these employees often ask about advice on the best way to leave Facebook. He's also experienced an increase in calls from other companies that are running references on current Facebook staffers.""Once it becomes weird to tell people that they work at Facebook, or once their moms aren't proud of them anymore, that's when people are going to head to the exits,"" he said. ""I think we're already getting there.""Previously, Facebook's attrition rate was less than 5 percent, estimated one of the former Facebook managers, who left the company earlier this year. This person believes that attrition rate has risen this year.""Nobody really left Facebook. There were not many places you could leave that were better jobs,"" the former manager said. ""Now? I think it's normalized. People now don't look at Facebook as a dream job anymore. They're open to leaving, and they can envision places that are better."""
1179,2012-11-29T17:09:16-0500,"Microsoft's Surface tablet running a full version of Windows 8 Pro will start selling in January for $899 and up, the company said Thursday. But you'll have to pay more if you want a keyboard cover and the popular Office suite of software. The current Surface uses the slimmed down Windows RT operating system. As a result, it runs only specially designed applications from Microsoft and others sold through the company's online store. The Pro version of Surface will also run regular Windows applications written for desktops and laptops.   ""It's a full PC AND a tablet,"" Surface general manager Panos Panay wrote in a blog post Thursday.   The Surface represents Microsoft's first foray into manufacturing its own general-purpose computer. In doing so, the company is competing with some of its partners, the manufacturers of PCs and tablets.   The announced price is in line with Microsoft earlier statements that the Pro version would cost about the same as slim, lightweight laptops known as ultrabooks.   The price includes a stylus and software that disregards touches from one's palm while writing on the touch screen. But the detachable touch-sensitive keyboard cover is sold separately. The Touch Cover with keys printed on it costs $120, while the Type Cover with depressable keys is priced at $130.   The Pro version of Surface will come with Intel's Core i5 processor, which Microsoft said gives it a graphics boost compared with the RT version.   The $899 version will come with 64 gigabytes of memory, while $999 gets you 128 GB of memory. It was not immediately clear how much memory would be used up by the operating system and pre-installed apps. For the RT versions, the 32 GB model has only 16 GB of usable memory, while the 64 GB model has 45 GB available.   The RT version of Surface, which starts at $499, comes with the popular Office programs Word, PowerPoint, Excel and OneNote included. The Pro version does not, according to the specifications listed on a Microsoft website. The cheapest version of Office available is priced at $120.   The RT versions went on sale Oct. 26, the same day Windows 8 was out.   The RT versions are available only at Microsoft's stores and websites. The Redmond, Wash., did not say whether the Pro versions will be sold elsewhere as well.   All versions of Surface come with a slot to expand memory and a USB port for peripherals. The Pro version of Surface comes with a newer, faster USB 3.0 port, while the RT version has 2.0.     email: tech@cnbc.com "

1181,2012-11-13T11:30:58-0500,"The departure of Windows chief Steven Sinofsky from Microsoft caught many by surprise, especially since the company just launched the most significant revamp of its operating system ever. WhenMicrosoft unveiled Windows 8 less than a month ago, Sinofsky called it ""a major milestone in the evolution and the revolution of computing."" (Read More: Microsoft's Windows Unit Head, Possible CEO, Exits )That's why Microsoft watchers were stunned that Sinofsky, a 23-year company veteran, is leaving.According to a report from All Things D, Microsoft's co-founder and former CEO Bill Gates decided to back CEO Steve Ballmer's move to part ways with Sinofsky. Basically, Ballmer wanted to allow for more integration within divisions of the company and involve more executives in the development of future versions of Windows OS, the report claims. But Sinofsky was not a fan of involving other divisions in his work and had a reputation of being somewhat difficult to work with, David Hilal, director of technology research at FBR Capital Markets, told CNBC Tuesday.""On one hand,  Sinofsky was known as a great manager to get products out on time,"" Hilal said. But ""he's known for not necessarily playing well in the sandbox and this is the time that Microsoft certainly needs to get all of its divisions working together."" Sinofsky, though, assured Microsoft employees that this wasn't the case. ""Some might notice a bit of chatter speculating about this decision or timing,"" he said in an email to employees. ""I can assure you that none could be true as this was a personal and private choice that in no way reflects any speculation or theories one might read about me, opportunity, the company or its leadership."" Still, it is worth noting that Sinofsky was seen as a possible successor to Ballmer and his leaving the company may cause some backlash from some investors, Hilal said.""There's more than a handful of investors that would like to see a change of management at the very top and Sinofsky was often viewed as a likely number two and successor to Ballmer,"" Hilal said. ""With his departure there is no other obvious successor to Mr. Ballmer so I think some investors are interpreting it as Steve is going to be around a little longer than they would ideally like.""Read Sinofsky's full email below.  With the general availability of Windows 8/RT and Surface, I have decided it is time for me to take a step back from my responsibilities at Microsoft. I've always advocated using the break between product cycles as an opportunity to reflect and to look ahead, and that applies to me too. After more than 23 years working on a wide range of Microsoft products, I have decided to leave the company to seek new opportunities that build on these experiences. My passion for building products is as strong as ever and I look forward focusing my energy and creativity along similar lines. The Windows team, in partnerships across all of Microsoft and our industry, just completed products and services introducing a new era of Windows computing. It is an incredible experience to be part of a generational change in a unique product like Windows, one accomplished with an undeniable elegance. Building on Windows, Surface excels in design and utility for a new era of PCs.With the Store, Internet Explorer, Outlook.com, SkyDrive and more, each of which lead the way, this experience is connected to amazing cloud services. It is inspiring to think of these efforts making their way into the hands of Microsofts next billion customers. We can reflect on this project as a remarkable achievement for each of us and for the team. Our work is not done, such is the world of technology, and so much more is in store for customers. It is impossible to count the blessings I have received over my years at Microsoft. I am humbled by the professionalism and generosity of everyone I have had the good fortune to work with at this awesome company. I am beyond grateful. I have always promised myself when the right time came for me to change course, I would be brief, unlike one of my infamous short blog posts, and strive to be less memorable than the products and teams with which I have been proudly and humbly associated. The brevity of this announcement is simply a feature. Some might notice a bit of chatter speculating about this decision or timing. I can assure you that none could be true as this was a personal and private choice that in no way reflects any speculation or theories one might readabout me, opportunity, the company or its leadership. As Ive always believed in making space for new leaders as quickly as possible, this announcement is effective immediately and I will assist however needed with the transition. I am super excited for what the future holds for the team and Microsoft. With my deepest appreciation, Steven Sinofsky Sent from Surface RT  email: tech@cnbc.com"
1182,2012-11-12T14:32:01-0500," Microsoft is releasing the first security patches for its Windows 8 operating system and Windows RT Tuesday.While the company said the security updates are part of its monthly patch cycle, the security fixes were announced just days after a security company reported it had found multiple vulnerabilities in Windows 8 and in Internet Explorer. On Oct. 30, Vupen, a security company, claimed it found a problem with Windows 8 and with Internet Explorer 10. Vupen is a unique security company because it finds security vulnerabilities in popular software and then sells its findings to government agencies or companies, but does not share its findings with the actual vendor for free. ""We discovered multiple vulnerabilities mainly caused by memory corruption issues in Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10 components which could be exploited via a specially crafted web page,"" said Chaouki Bekrar, Vupen's CEO and head of research, in a statement to CNBC. ""Combining and chaining these flaws allowed us to confirm code execution and bypass security features recently introduced in Windows 8.""Microsoft posted on Nov. 9 that it would be issuing the security patches on Tuesday, less than two weeks after Vupen's reports of security flaws. The security fixes issued for Tuesday will include three ""critical"" security vulnerabilities for Windows 8 and one ""critical"" fix for Windows RT, the OS Microsoft's Surface tablet runs on. Microsoft did not disclose specific information about what vulnerabilities it would be fixing with the security patch, but the company will host a webcast on Wednesday to answer customers' questions and address an concerns, according to the company's website.""We are committed to improving the security of all our products. When security updates are released, customers who have Automatic Updates enabled will be protected automatically and do not need take an action,"" said Dave Forstrom, director of Microsoft's security response center, in a statement to CNBC.Security firm Bitdefender also reported security problems with Windows 8. The company said that even when Microsoft's anti-spyware called Windows Defender was running, the OS was still vulnerable to about 15 percent of the top 100 malware types that were most used by cybercriminals in 2012. While some security vulnerabilities have been found in Windows 8 OS, its security measures trump all former versions of Windows OS, according to a Nov. 2 Twitter post by Chaouki Bekrar, Vupen's CEO and head of research.""It took us a very long time and important resources to find and exploit all these vulnerabilities which confirms that Windows 8 is definitely the most secure Windows version ever,"" Bekrar said. ""It will be very difficult for criminals to create zero-day attacks against it in the short term as the cost would be too high for a small return on investment.""  email: tech@cnbc.com"

Bill Gates said it would be unfortunate to see the U.S. miss out on the economic opportunity related to cutting greenhouse gas emissions.Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, is among the world's most prominent climate advocates, in addition to his work around the world preventing infectious diseases. He shared some of his thoughts on global warming in an interview that aired Sunday on Axios on HBO.""It's very American to invent things to help the entire world. We're always on the front of new science and new product development. So it would be tragic if this was the first time the U.S. didn't play that role,"" Gates told Axios journalists Ina Fried and Amy Harder.The interview aired two days after the Trump administration released a government report that said damage from global warming could slash as much as 10 percent off the nation's economy by the end of the century. The administration, which has pulled out of the Paris climate agreement, was criticized for releasing the report on the Friday afternoon of Thanksgiving weekend, when many people are not paying attention to the news.Certainly there is some industry activity that could make a difference. Harder said renewable energy sources like wind and solar, and electric car companies like Tesla, generate headlines. Gates pointed out that electricity is just one of a few things that create emissions.""A lot of people think, OK, renewable energy, wind and solar, has gotten a lot cheaper, isn't that it?"" Gates said. ""Well, electricity is only a quarter of the problem. In fact, we've got to solve the entire 100 percent.

That snapped a four-day run of gains for the Dow. Google fell again Friday, giving up $14.14 to $680.86.The Dow is still up 0.6 percent for the week. The S&amp;P 500 up is up 0.8 percent.In other Friday trading, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 1.77 percent from 1.83 percent late Thursday.Among other stocks making big moves, Chipotle Mexican Grill plunged 14 percent after the burrito chain forecast that revenue growth would slow sharply next year. The stock had been a favorite among investors thanks to super-fast growth in recent years. The stock fell $41.32 to $244.61."

1192,2012-10-15T16:54:50-0400,"Microsoft's Windows 8 will likely have a slow roll out until there are more touchscreen tablets and ultrabooks to run it on, Nomura Securities' head of technology research said Monday on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" The new operating system is designed for tablets and other touchscreen devices and will not be ""terribly seductive"" to anyone using a traditional mouse and keyboard, Richard Sherlund said. With few touchscreen laptops and tablets outside of Apple  products, there could be some negativity surrounding Windows 8 during the quarter, the analyst warned. Sherlund, who has a ""buy"" rating on Microsoft's stock, said Windows 8 and Microsoft will be a better story in 2013. ""I think as you build through 2013, you get more touch devices and the price points on ultrabook touch devices will come under $1,000."" With new and cheaper touchscreen hardware coming, Sherlund sees a big upgrade cycle and greater excitement in the PC market. That should benefit both Windows 8 shipments and Microsoft's stock. The key will be getting corporate users and those consumers who need to use Microsoft's Office product to upgrade. Along with the expected disappointing rollout for Windows 8, earnings could pressure Microsoft shares this week. With the PC market in decline from tablet competition, reported revenues are likely to be down 6 percent to 7 percent, Sherlund warned. ""The sentiment will get more negative, and that will be a good opportunity,"" he said. Sherlund has a $37 price target on the stock, implying 25 percent potential upside. —By CNBC.com's Justin Menza.

1193,2012-10-05T06:40:00-0400,"FRANKFURT, Oct 5 (Reuters) - Mobile phone maker Motorola achieved a rare victory against software giant Microsoft in a patent case before a German court on Friday, the latest in a wave of patent lawsuits by technology firms fighting over market share.  The regional court in Mannheim ruled that Motorola Mobility, part of Google , did not infringe a Microsoft patent which enables applications to work on different handsets.  This allows application developers to avoid writing separate codes for each handset saving time and development costs.  Germany has become a major battleground in the global patent war between makers of mobile phones, tablet computer devices and their operating software because court actions there have proved relatively cheap and quicker than in other jurisdictions.  Microsoft has won three patent cases against Motorola in Germany. As a result of these rulings, smartphones with the disputed technology are no longer available on the German market.  ""This decision does not impact multiple injunctions Microsoft has already been awarded and has enforced against Motorola products in Germany,"" said David Howard, associate general counsel at Microsoft.  Google bought lossmaking Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion last year, in its largest acquisition ever, aiming to use the company's patents to fend off legal challenges against its Android mobile platform and expand beyond its software business.  Other technology companies have also invested billions of dollars in buying up patent portfolios that they can use against rivals.  Motorola could not immediately be reached for comment.

People forget that its server business is just about as big as its Windows business — its Office products. There’s still no alternative to Word, to Excel, to Powerpoint. It’s got Xbox. It’s got Internet Explorer. It is trying to innovate in lots of different ways,” he said.

And if they do get some of these growth opportunities right, there is upside from there.

The biggest trades of the day were the purchase of 12,000 Jan. 40-strike calls for $0.59 and the purchase of 7500 Jan. 27-strike calls for 4.80. The 40-strike calls will turn a profit if MSFT is above 40.59 at expiration, a 35 percent move higher, and the 27-strike calls will make money if MSFT is above 31.80, a 5 percent move higher. (Track Microsoft here.)Why the bullishness? Well, on Wednesday MSFT touched its 200-day moving average, which stopped the stock's decline and acted as support. These option trades show traders are willing to bet that this is a turning point in the stock and that it will see a sharp rally into 2013.
